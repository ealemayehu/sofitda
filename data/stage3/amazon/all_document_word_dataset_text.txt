2 4 So many accessories come with this camera for any situation! Also my GoPro accessories work with this camera as well! 
3 3 This item worked as expected, and was great for the simple task of keeping an eye on my drive way. 
4 4 It did what it was supposed to do. Satisfactory Product 
5 4 Great camera 
6 1 While this will do the job, the plastic construction is very flimsy and more expensive that others that appear to be made out of better materials. Look for something else. 
7 3 Bag is very nice quality. Beware of how small it is though, I end up have to return this! 
8 4 Why purchase a great Sony lens and get a knock-off lens cap? Picked up this as an extra. 
9 4 Use these to upgrade cables I got with cameras. These cables work great. I installed 13 Lorex cameras including a PTZ camera and have not had any issues. There is no signal issues particularly for cameras more than 100 feet away from DVR. 
10 0 These are fakes! I could barely control my Phantom with these on and nearly crashed into nearby objects. DO NOT BUY THESE! 
11 4 good 
12 4 I bought this thinking my camera needed a new battery, but it turns out it has some other issues. The battery itself was great along with the shipping which came early than anticipated which was fantastic! 
13 4 GREAT LENS FOR THE MONEY 
14 4 my new baby love it!!!! 
15 4 Attached it to my waterproof Nikon coolpix camera and it works great- the camera floats. Also, the floatie is not overly big and bulky. 
16 2 Has short depth of field. 
17 0 No support. Doesn t do ftp doesn t work properly with motion detection, doesn t seem to do anything well. 
18 4 Good buy 
19 2 So far it works well. My only complaint is that the cord is shorter than the original. 
20 4 Easy to adjust and fits comfortably on anyone s head. Perfect mount for any activity to get great action shots with the GoPro! 
21 4 Hands down, the best mount Ive came across! I originally bought the $5 knock off one, and it broke the second day I had it! 
22 2 It was a gift. She liked it 
23 3 A bit bulky, but it held my brother s camera above water when dropped it in the ocean on accident! 
24 0 This thing is a pile of junk, cannot even figure out how to make it take pictures! Once you turn it on you cant turn it back off you have to wait for it to die. 
25 4 Love these wipes! Third time I ve bought these. 
26 1 With no OSD there is no way to change the camera settings and the picture is so bright it is almost washed out. I m replacing this one with something that will work for FPV. 
27 4 Everything I have ever bought from Cowboy Studio has been good stuff. 
28 3 Nice bag overall. One of the side buttons was broken. 
29 0 I can t seem to get this strap to the point where I know it won t drop my camera. 
30 4 Fits my Nikon D3100. neck strap very comfortable. Can t beat the price. Would recommend to anyone wanting a more comfortable strap than the one provided by Nikon. 
31 2 display went broken, purchase was quickly reimbursed, so I bought Nikon 610P 
32 4 Works as promised, lost my other one, and this one fits perfectly! 
33 4 Excellent product. It adds flair to my black/white/pink camera strap. 
34 3 Great backdrop. Does have folds but I believe those will go away over time. Great product for the price! 
35 3 Good. 
36 1 These batteries are not good at all. They hold a charge a fraction of the time of the regular battery. 
37 4 Everything came as described! Great deal! Fast shipping! Would buy from again! Thank you. 
38 4 I needed a new camera and bought this going on very little info. I LOVE IT!! It has been the best little camera for everyday pics and video. I m always pleased with my prints. 
39 4 Love it! Everything I need fits in neat and comfortably. 
40 4 Excellent product. With all three tubes connected was not able to have auto function but that s not a problem. Will never use them all together anyway. Would recommend. 
41 4 Great camera, got it few months back and enjoying it. Superb quality and fast shipping from beach camera... 
42 0 Very disappointed, needed my software tools to get the going. Did not stated in description. 
43 4 Arrived earlier than expected and as described. Very good price for all included items. 
44 3 Works great with smartthings... Wish it was a little smaller. 
45 3 rec d as promised and as advertised 
46 0 when i purchased this, i do not remember it saying things were not included, i can almost remember it saying it was a complete kit. NEver been out of the box, since hubby knoew it wasn t complete kit. 
47 3 Got this camera at a great discounted price and am very happy with it excellent night vision, very easy to set up for use with ipad. 
48 4 AAA+++ 
49 4 Very good camera. Works great!! 
50 3 a great little case to carry your Coolpix Camera around with you in the car or anywhere s. it protects it from damage that could happen if you just carried it everywhere without this case. Has a strap to carry it by too. 
51 4 love it 
52 4 Real easy mount to handlbars 
53 4 Perfect, exactly as described. 
54 4 They work great. I did not.use the cables that came with it I use regular mono audio cable. 
55 3 Just enough there so I don t drop the camera. 
56 4 Looks and feels like a great product arrived on time and was exactly how it was described haven t used it a whole lot but seems to work good 
57 4 Wow great filter very smooth rotation and really nice fit and finish super thin should work well on my Tokina 11-16. 
58 4 Love the color resolution of Ektar; again I am a free-lace professional photographer---went to the Nikon School of Photography---love experimenting with various formats 
59 4 I like the camera. It came with a nice package. 
60 4 It is what it s stated. The horn works great. 
61 4 lovee my lamp 
62 2 Works well enough, but it s a huge rip-off that this item doesn t include the velcro strap that holds it to your speedlite. It includes sticky velcro bits, but these would be stuck to your speedlite permanently and wouldn t allow for other, similar attachments (like a diffuser box). 
63 4 Battery charger works fine; cheaper than Fuji product. 
64 4 I couldn t be happier. 
65 4 Great item 
66 4 Kenneth was very helpful dealing with the problem that I was having with my 2 camera s. They are both up and running. The port forwarding is up and running also. Thanks again for the support. 
67 2 it s okay 
68 3 Exactly as expected. 
69 4 It is so nice to have a machine to take our old slides and negatives and make them digital! Nice quality. 
70 4 Very nice little camera 
71 2 It s ok. 
72 1 All the velcro comes off and my camera and gear gets jumbled. Great durability though! But terrible &#34;compartments.&#34; 
73 4 This is a great portable tripod. It s sturdy, and easy to use. 
74 4 I use this for my gopro.I loop it through the case hole which works reallywell the onlydonside is you cant attach it to anything else but then again if you are using a wrist strap you should be holding the camera anyway 
75 4 Pen Camera & Keychain Camera works perfectly and delivered on-time, Thank You 
76 3 It s ok 
77 3 They are a little different from my original battery but them make good back up batteries. 
78 4 Needed this for a larger lens I d purchased...great! 
79 4 Does what its designed for. Seller was great with customer service. One of the batteries died after 3 weeks. Big Mike sent me a new one free of charge. I did have to send the defective one back as proof but that s cool with me. Mike 
80 4 fit my light exactly 
81 4 perfect for the job. 
82 4 This fit my GoPro 3 waterproof case perfectly! It allowed me to securely attach a floating lanyard wriststrap on my GoPro for when I shoot hand-held at the beach or out in the surf at the ocean. 
83 3 Great product for the price 
84 3 Work great. Nice and bright. 
85 4 Works great, it brought life back to my older GoPro Hero 2 and the batteries last much longer than the original. 
86 4 Seems sturdy enough to handle what my son throws at it. Been on bike rides and under water and not treated lightly, yet holding up well. 
87 4 May not be real leather, but fits like a glove and classy looking. 
88 0 The product did not fit the camera body properly and was a waste of money. 
89 4 Amazing deal, and this works so much better than even the battery that came with my camera. 
90 4 so coool i got to get more usin this one to control the LEDs on my tool box 
91 3 This one is much better for someone with smaller wrist because this is some what adjustable. 
92 4 These batteries are better than the one that came with it. Very happy with this purchase. 
93 4 work as we were expected. 
94 0 Camera spins all around. Terrible extension pole. just by the &#34;GoPro&#34; made products. They are more expensive but the quality speaks for itself. 
95 3 Package came on time and works fine. 
96 4 Great replacement battery 
97 4 This is my 3 camera like this. Love it and have given to friends. While I have newer cameras, this is an excellent goto and carry camera. Easy to use and excellent results. Has everything and more on it. 
98 0 Product was missing POE injector. I ordered 5 none of them came with a free POE injector as mentioned in listing. 
99 4 Use it on my cell phone and Sony Action Cam. Kinda short but does the job, also build really sturdy. 
100 4 Awesome technology with a seamlessly integrated experience. Nest cam linked to Nest thermostat and tied to a mobile phone with IFTTT is the answer to all your home automation desires. 
101 4 Just perfect, works great. Get one and throw it in your camera bag. 
102 4 Everything was just as expected. Thanks. 
103 4 Great for the price 
104 4 Everything can be used on my hero 4 
105 4 Nice snug fit, yet easily removed. Perfect positioning on xe1. Nice finish. 
106 4 I lover it , nice camera , I recommend for any travel 
107 4 Easy to use ! Just a button All of my friend and family love it, Have a fun time with this instant camera Must have item in the party 
108 4 Small camera with great picture quality 
109 4 Works great made with high quality. No issues. 
110 4 Arrived quickly and works well. 
111 4 excelent 
112 4 I love the camera, works great in low light. I would not purchase from this seller again. 
113 4 Worked great holding my go pro 
114 4 A wonderful case. Well constructed and stylish. I m not sure it represents a value at over $100.00 though... 
115 4 works great as expected 
116 3 like camera a lot 
117 4 cameras are working great 
118 3 Good quality, covers all the basics. Very happy with the items 
119 4 Does what I wanted it for. Very pleased with purchase&#62;&#34; 
120 2 Works well. Doesn t last as long as the Nikon batteries, but far cheaper. 
121 4 Excellent shoe- very comfortable 
122 4 works well as expected 
123 3 Easy to use; load, unload, operate and keep dry. 
124 4 Works just as good as my D cell military issue 
125 0 This stabilizer is a piece of junk. Save yourself the trouble and just buy a glide cam. 
126 4 Awsome product you can t beat it 
127 4 its a fantastic addition to my camera. 
128 0 dosen t stick to the surface of my Jeep dash. 
129 1 Much larger than I thought it would be, can be awkward to have hanging on your neck strap, but it does hold the lens cap so I won t lose it. 
130 4 Great screen protector for the 5Ds even thought it can shift side to side just a little bit. Id recommend it to anyone. 
131 4 I ve used that can literally hold my Nikon D610 with its 28-300mm lens--now that s heavy. This thing is rock sold, light weight and easy to use. Get one. 
132 4 Excellent! Thank you!! 
133 4 When your hand can t seam to get it tight enough or your hands are greasy and slimy, this tool is a lifesaver to ensure that you GoPro Camera is tight! 
134 4 Works as advertized 
135 4 Excellent 
136 4 Wonderful pics. A perfect substitute for my Nikon coolpix... 
137 4 I m happy with it. Learning a lot. 
138 4 the kit was awesome, the camera bag, doubled as a hangbag in the evening. perfect size. all product was true to reivews and everything worked great. The condition of the ship was well packaged, I would recommend this highly 
139 3 Love this camera. Great to emsil photos directly from the camera. 
140 4 Nice camera! 
141 0 This camera conveniently stopped working just after the return period passed. Cheap, flimsy, and apparently breaks easily. Stay away from it! 
142 3 So far, so good compared to my carbon fiber props 
143 4 I use this all the time now. love it. 
144 1 I guess it is true that you get what you pay for. the frame is flimsy and I was not able to figure out how to use it. Am returning it. 
145 3 It s a nice strap, well made, strong, and comfortable, and it looks good too. I like the length of the strap but just me personally. I m sure an adjustable version of this strap will fit more people s needs. 
146 3 Works OK 
147 4 i love it...as expected 
148 4 Great quality... 
149 0 This didn t work! 
150 3 Allowed me to go from 52mm to 77 on Canon Lenses. 
151 1 The first time I used, one of the lights stop working 
152 4 fit perfect and works great for a Bullard T3 
153 4 Works flawlessly with Minolta MC lenses on Lumix GX1, as described. Thanks! 
154 0 It is impossible to use the camera without completely removing the upper part of the case. It s just to tight for flexible use. 
155 4 Best two dollars I have ever spent. It is very strong and fit on my tripod perfectly. It might not fit your tripod though, all are not the same! I would check the specs if they are available. Happy shopping! 
156 4 Great kit and seller 
157 3 Water got inside and I haven t been able to get it out. Other than that it s as advertised, floats well, would recommend. 
158 4 Seems to be very good so far. Great on eyeglasses and electronics. I like the large size, easy to use. Very pleased. 
159 4 Great battery 
160 4 Very good service. No issues with the battery. Very good alternative. 
161 1 The first set did not thread properly, i was sent another set with an adapter, once using that I can no longer use my lens cap. 
162 2 It doesn’t hold a charge as well as the Panasonic battery. 
163 4 bought these to hook thumb drives to for my clients.... what can I say... they are inexpensive... and they do exactly what they are made to do... good job 
164 4 Great product quality. The MagicFiber is very strong, yet soft. Product was exact as described and arrived early than we expected, as well great packing. Yes, will buy again. 
165 4 Works better than expected and easy installation. Motion detection with record works great. Catches my cat passing by. Speaking and listening features work well. 
166 4 Great 
167 4 Very high quality caps at a great price. What else do you want? 
168 3 This is really nice for small spaces inside for bouncing the light (instead of using a card to bounce off of). I ve since purchased a separate flash, but will keep this as a backup! 
169 4 Great filters to have on hand for some fun special effect shots to make your pictures pop out. Be creative and make special moments even better. 
170 4 Great seller! Great product! 
171 4 Good morning. How long does delivery in the box of this product. Thank you. [[ASIN:B00YX6KSS6 PowerLead PLD003 DV C8 16MP High Definition Digital Video Camcorder Dv DVR 2.7 TFT LCD 16x Zoom Hd Video Recorder Camera 1280 x 720p Digital Video Camcorder Camera Black]] 
172 4 Came really fast. Had no defects Im in love with this product:) 
173 3 Touch screen sensitivity not as good as a smart phone. Worsens when screen protector film is applied. 
174 4 top of the line. 
175 3 GREAT DEAL OVER ALL FOR THE PRICE. WOULD HAVE LIKE IT MORE IF THE PACKAGE CAME WITH MORE DETAIL ON LENS USEAGE 
176 1 Fair 
177 4 Have used the mask twice now and like it. 
178 4 Very happy with this purchase. Amazing quality and so easy to use 
179 2 Sometimes the camera will just fall off. So now we double check the tightness of the connection often. 
180 4 Nice clarity and adheres easily without any bubbles. No squeegee required. 
181 4 I was impressed with the quality. I usually buy Cowboy Studio products for short jobs or one time uses, but this backdrop setup is actually pretty decent. 
182 4 Exactly what I expected! 
183 4 Great lens! I like this package because it includes some freebies. The add ons are not great but they are free so no complaints. This is my go to lens. 
184 4 Very good quality, it fits perfect, very light but strong. 
185 4 great quality pic...easy to configure. 
186 4 This is my 4th Canon SX camera. I m pleased with the performance and also the battery life. I use cameras for work, I m outdoors, on roofs, in crawl spaces and in attics with or without any light source and the picture quality is very good. 
187 4 This monopod is perfect when you need to steady your camera for a shot, but you don t have the time to set up a tripod. The small size of the monopod makes it easy to tuck away until you need it. 
188 4 Worked perfectly in my camera. I needed additional batteries since I would be using the camera in the Grand Canyon for 10 days without a way to recharge the battery. Worked like a charm! 
189 4 Very useful 
190 4 Great replacement as it is also the original from Nikon come with the original box also. 
191 2 Don t hesitate to call customer service for help setting this up if you are having trouble. I fried one and called customer service and learned all kinds of goodies not mention in the instructions. 
192 4 ok 
193 4 Great quality, thank you 
194 4 Exactly what I was looking for 
195 3 awesome fluid head! bought it along with a K2 Slider, very sturdy and solid build! Super smooth pan and Tilt! 
196 3 a little flimsy, but works for my purposes 
197 4 love it 
198 4 Great product, was as described. Worked perfectly. 
199 1 box was partially crushed. cheap remote with NVR was cracked.no manual came with NVR and it appeared like it had been used before. 
200 4 Been a photojournalist way back highschool for the school paper but never really pursued photography after. I never thought i would spend this much but oh boy, i was so surprised when i got the package today, there was so much in it! great package deal! 
201 0 for some reason don t work 
202 4 Amazing case for my drone, all the accessories fit in the right place. Would recommend it to everybody who has a Dji Phantom 3 drone. 
203 4 Great product at a great price! 
204 4 It s nice and durable, snaps onto a belt buckle if you re hiking. Good buy, good deal. 
205 4 Good 
206 2 could be made more user friendly 
207 4 Works 
208 4 Great quality 
209 4 Martin Powell at Foscam was very helpful in setting up my camera. Tech support is great. 
210 4 love it works good for my needs and nice design. Thanks!! 
211 4 Really good product. Delivery on time, and is exactly they describe. 
212 4 Work great with my &#34;Chesty Mount&#34;. No complaints. Fast shipping. Good Price. 
213 4 Suprisingly simple yet effective protection. It is large enough for my Nikon D810 with the 24-120mm lens and lens hood (a sizable hood, reversed on the lens body) to fit snugly. 
214 0 The software will not download. I need to return it 
215 4 Fits and works perfectly. Really enjoy the stereo sound now when recording video 
216 4 Excelent! 
217 4 Love the way my photo equipment goes in to the bag, well made material, happy with the product 
218 4 Hello ....I highly recommend this product ...it is very nice aNd easy to operate and co portable for handy....everywhere I go I ll bring this with me and I hope I can get one of this to give it to my sister in ph..... 
219 4 No problems. Batteries are now charged and ready to use 
220 4 excellent ever 
221 3 So far i like it but am still learning all the different things it can do. the instruction guide is sadly lacking so I am using the hit and miss method. It does take excellent pictures 
222 4 Good transaction and a good product. 
223 4 awesome 
224 0 The film had a bubble in the center of the pack which shows up on the picture. Plus the film has a blue faded border 
225 1 It is not good quality,now it is not working!flash light on and any keys no function !i put it into my trash can ,it is unbelievable such kind of thing happened on Amazon! 
226 0 I CAN TAKE BETTER PICTURES WITH MY ORIGINAL SONY LENS THAN USING THIS PIECE OF GLASS. 
227 4 I LOVE this lens. I initially bought it to do indoor shoots but end up using it outdoor because it creates such beautiful photos! 
228 4 Excelente! 
229 4 Works filne 
230 4 I love my new camera! I shopped for a long time, read a lot of reviews, and this is the one I chose! It is easy to use and takes great pictures! 
231 4 Good and attractive. Clear pictures 
232 4 Perfect cheap and resistan 
233 4 Awesome sauce! Works great easy to use I go away a lot it saves the day every day compact good for almost everything 
234 4 Love it! 
235 4 it is worth it and I like lot of the tripod will use lots for outdoor like wildlife or landscapes thank for Amazon and the price awesome. 
236 4 Great Product! 
237 3 Really easy to use, light weight, and it helps you adjust the exposure which is great. Only downside is you use film up quickly so it s a good idea to stock up good thing the film is relatively cheap. Overall happy with my purchase 
238 4 Love it! 
239 0 No cameras!! So, I returned/replaced and what do you know? No cameras AGAIN!! Wth 
240 1 Pan head release lever broke within 6 months with minimal use. Unfortunately, past the refund date and I can t find a replacement part. 
241 4 Had a spec on the sensor easily removed by this blower. 
242 4 works good 
243 4 My pride and joy! 
244 4 Easy easy easy to use and fly 
245 4 Great starter dslr camera and extras. The tripod is nice. The filters are rubbish but everything else is great. 
246 4 A great accessory kit 
247 4 I actually buy these tanks just for the reels. The reels with the bigger loading ears are so easy to use. I have three of these and use them weekly. Highly recommend for 35mm or medium format processing. 
248 4 Vincent, was super in both helping me set up my cameras very professional, Cameras are great I have 5 foscam cameras with no problems!! great products!! 
249 4 Great for an extra wide angel lenses like my Canon 10-22mm. For extra wide lenses, you need a slim profile for such wide angles and good quality glass. 
250 3 This is an excellent set and delivers excellent quality photos and video. I also have a Sony A-58, and while I m not sure that this camera does a better job, can say that both are very good for the money. 
251 4 The case fits Phantom 3 perfectly. It s a must have to protect your investment. Also bought one for my brother and he loves it 
252 3 nice item need spares........ 
253 0 I thought it d be much better the straps were all too loose and you were unable to tighten it 
254 4 Looks real from a short distance. Exactly what I was looking for. 
255 4 Very Nice! These are great for low light conditions. They re a bit heavy for extended use without a tripod but the payoff is the light gathering power. 
256 4 THANKS 
257 4 Great product 
258 4 Worked as stated. 
259 4 This battery does hold its own. It is second to none in its class. 
260 3 I am pleased with the product thus far - the field of view seems pretty good. Vincent was great with helping me set this up on my wifi network. 
261 4 My grandson LOVED this camera and uses it regularly ! 
262 2 it s fine 
263 4 works well 
264 1 It s slow 
265 4 Awesome product works will for the price 
266 0 Did not fit my camera 
267 0 Cameras were too low rez. 
268 4 my favorite pouch 
269 4 Just what I needed! 
270 4 LOVE THIS!!! I use it for everthing from recording instructional videos to pool side shenanigans and boating fun! 
271 4 darn someone stole it....no wonder...a great camera 
272 2 This product is not for high shutter speed. its working fine only till 250/second S.speed. But SLRs usually have S.speed range of 4000 - 6000 per second. Thus this flash dismissed 
273 0 Takes great photos BUT never drop it. The camera fell from my pants pocket and never worked correctly again. Customer service from Nikon was very disappointing. I would never order another Nikon product ever. 
274 0 Camera picture is great, but significantly limited by constant dropping of wireless connections despite strong signal. Worse it then fails to reconnect without rebooting. Maybe a firmware upgrade will improve the situation, but hard to recommend as an outdoor wireless solution. 
275 4 I m just starting out with my DSLR caverage so I do not have tons of equipment but for what I do havery this has been perfect. Also travels well and has enough space for odds and ends without having to bring anew extra.bag for personals. Great purchase 
276 4 I just received today this item and is big, more than I was expected, is good for a camera, even a camcorder and most of the equipment, so if you are serious on photography this is it. 
277 4 great quality 
278 4 Very good, easy to use and charge. Presentable and keep charge very well. 
279 4 good experience dealing with this item. 
280 4 Got this for my gf. She loves it! 
281 3 Suitable for EOS M with 22 mm lens. Beware, it would not fit if you have a lens hood. 
282 4 They work well. You get a lot of them, the size is good, and they aren t that expensive. 
283 4 Works great! Took it out into he back country, had several other people take turns carying it on a long Mtn climb. They all commented on how comfortable it was! 
284 4 works just fine--and at a lower cost than Canon s. 
285 3 Tripod is crap, others fine 
286 4 Best video stabilizer I ve ever used. Great use anywhere and the price is very affordable. Thank God for this video stabilizer. 
287 3 Seems to charge drained battery fairly rapidly. Car charger a nice touch. 
288 4 Product arrived as promised. 
289 4 it is good 
290 4 works well for my needs 
291 3 So far everything works fine. 
292 4 Yes. Wish every camera had this. Works great, lightweight, protects the lens. 
293 3 Iphone 6 plus with a case is hard to fit and stay. 
294 0 first of all this tripod is 45&#34; tall not 50&#34; as advertised. It is also incredibly flimsy. 
295 4 Perfect compliment for my Sony mark II camera. This camera case protects very well my investment. 
296 4 What I needed. Thanks! 
297 4 PERFECT. 
298 4 They work really well 
299 3 fit GoPro wonderfuly and fit nicely into the flash hot shoe 
300 4 Took some time getting used to knowing when it was on or not but it worked great when I did. Used it for a youtube reality show where people compete in small challenges and it worked like a charm! 
301 4 Great than I think.. Just imagine 83x zoom... It s soooooooo amazing.. Attached image is full moon with 83x zoom.. Not cropped image.. Unbeliable~~!!!! 
302 4 Very nice tripod. I like the sturdy feel of it. 
303 3 Great deal on a terrific flash. 
304 4 Seems to have everything was looking for. Very pleased with the whole process. Certainly faster than ordering from the manufacturer. 
305 4 The power pack and charger is versatile enough to allow charging in many different situations. It definitely met all of my needs. 
306 1 The screen viewing angle was very poor. Also, the motion censor switched off the photo frame even when we were seated near by and we had no way of setting the time delay for the frame to switch off. Overall a poor design. 
307 2 This was really hard to figure out on which buttons to push. The instructions said the light would be one color and it was different on the pen. Not very good. 
308 4 I love this.excellent flash 
309 4 As good or better than the original GoPro Chest Strap. I am extremely satisfied with this product. My GoPro one wore out after a year of constant usage. This one feels like it will last longer. Well manufactured!! 
310 0 Didn t work!! Don t buy 
311 4 excellent product 
312 0 I can t believe this was rated as highly as it is. Everything about this is so cheap. The velcro and the panels all show up like eye sores in photographs. Even if I could iron out the creases it still wouldn t be useable. Really disappointed. 
313 3 The camera nice zoom great but cant get it to hook to wifi call and email kodak with no response i have other kodaks love them very dissapointed in the company lack of customer services 
314 4 Very smart design, makes life so much easier 
315 3 This is loud, but not incredibly loud. If you are in the same room it is loud. But we have ours downstairs and i am not sure it would wake us up if we were sleeping. The long cord on the ac adaptor is a nice feature 
316 4 Fits the bill 
317 4 [[VIDEOID:8a690c986214b35c86e6be7f1d1af04f]]I just bought one of these cameras and it is everything it says it is! I am completely blown away by the quality for the price! I highly recommend this little guy! I added a video from work that I took using this camera! 
318 4 The TX heat melted away my dashcam but it still works! Wow! 
319 4 Works good, already had a accident in mi dirt bike and resist the impact, but keeps working good !!! 
320 2 Still playing with it. some time is works and other times it does not. Once I know more I will make a more informed comment. 
321 3 Works very well. Only reason for the 4 stars, is that the dimensions are not perfect on it. One side is shorter in width then the other. Luckily the material stretches so I was able to make up the difference. 
322 4 Just like everyone says, it is so adorable 
323 4 Good product..... 
324 3 For some reason, this lens capp was very awkward to take off. I am hoping it will loosen and become easier to on-off the lens. 
325 0 The background is see through really doesn t work well with photography we shooting with our something dark in back of it 
326 4 As described and shipped fast! Thanks 
327 4 Saved my GoPro .... 
328 0 This is a horrible product! Do not buy! The image is distorted around the edges with no sharpness at all! I will be asking for a refund! Yes you get a wider angle but what good is it when you loose all sharpness around the edges! 
329 4 No problems with set up, self programed, easy. 
330 2 Hard to focus for pictures 
331 0 Terrible 
332 1 According to bhphotovideo.com, these cameras are only 0.3 MP CMOS. To me that means LOW resolution. No wonder the listed specs are so vague. It s a good buy if you are willing to settle for such low res imaging. 
333 3 great quality for the price. I gave it four stars because there is quite a bit of electronic feedback in the audio. 
334 4 Everything you need for a clean camera. I feel like there s way too many microfiber cloths but I guess too many is better than not enough. 
335 3 This product was bought as a gift. Their overall rating was a four out five. 
336 2 The case is a little small. I bought it for a Nikon S3000, which is a very small camera, but the case is a verrry tight fit. 
337 3 All items included as described. Seems to be a good starter pack. 
338 4 Works great. 
339 4 Amazing, it s so compact. Throws farther than expected. 
340 4 The strap is a little stiff, but much more comfortable than the stock camera straps that come with most DSLRs. The suede underside feels so nice against the skin that I hardly notice it on my neck. I ve received many compliments on the cute pattern as well. 
341 4 This was excellent, I was able to watch tapes that I thought I would never be able to see again. I was able to share these memories with my grandchildren. 
342 4 This head strap works well, the price is reasonable. 
343 4 Great package, exactly as stated on the website. Lens is fantastic ... a little stiff in movement but otherwise amazing 
344 4 Works as advertised. Simple and well made ! 
345 4 I like the go pro, it works great and no problems 
346 1 Everything was great for a month then 3 cameras went gray. I was also unable to view on my phone or computer. 
347 4 Awesome seller! Fast shipping and delivered as expected. Thank you 
348 4 The product works great!! Walter the support person is very professional and excellent support person !!! 
349 4 Excell 
350 4 Really good quality for the price your paying and just enough for the newbie photographer. with this set you can experiment a lot and then jump to a professional 
351 4 Great product - but I ordered the wrong one - so I gave it as a gift to a friend that could use it on their camera. Good price and product. 
352 4 Love this set of products, I will be purchasing from this company again. 
353 2 The camera is nice, but the battery really doesn t hold a charge for more than a day or so. 
354 0 Sound quality of the voice of the person wearing the pen sucks. Is not compatible with Windows 8. Besides that the return was seamless. 
355 3 Easy to set up and use via phone apps. Cannot zoom in browser app. 2-way audio and night vision work well. HD feed is nice. 
356 3 Great camera for the price. Now I can watch what my dog is doing when I m not home. 
357 3 Love the lids, but the accompanying literature is a little thin in substance. 
358 4 My sister loved this and I m really glad it s compatible with the Polaroid version too 
359 4 These are genuine DJI propellers and they work well. The only thing that differentiates these propellers from the ones included with the Phantom 3 is the stripes on the tips of the propellers. These propellers are ONLY for the Phantom 3 
360 2 Doesn t let adding network cameras, unless they are directly connected to NVR. Doesn t let you conveniently display just two feeds where the display is positioned vertically (1x2 grid). 
361 3 Came quickly. Was exactly as expected. Thank you. 
362 3 Like it 
363 4 It s a very good kit for your camera it has some of the filter essentials 
364 4 Excellent charger for the camera battery. I have passed the camera on to my granddaughter who is still using this charger. 
365 4 Cute border and great quality photos 
366 4 Works great! 
367 1 Hi, I bought this product and I did not get all parties. in the picture I show the items they got me and the product comes with more items. would like to know what happened to the other items that bring the product? Thank you. 
368 3 Nice 
369 4 Love it. I am so happy with how smooth and fast everything started and ended 
370 4 love this camera , had this same one yrs ago 
371 4 Exactly as described, works fine, no issues. 
372 4 Great bundle. I purchased early to use as a stocking stuffer for my teenager. The colors are beautiful and it arrived looking just as advertised. It came quick and neatly packed. 
373 4 The unit showed up in perfect condition. It was very easy to set up and we are enjoying the use of our new security camera system. This was a pleasant online shopping experience. 
374 1 Buy good one once rather than buying cheap again and again 
375 4 Very happy with my purchase and delivery was on time as well. 
376 4 Manfrotto rocks! Great and aesthetic tripod! 
377 3 She loved it! 
378 4 I have used these for a while with no problems. Its always good to carry spare batteries for your GoPros. I would recommend these products. 
379 4 Perfect! Great product, great price, great delivery! 
380 0 bad quality of video 
381 4 Great product! The quality of the plug and set screws was very good. I found them easy to use in both retrofitting an existing cable as well as a new one. Will definitely reorder them from IMBAPricewhen the time comes. 
382 4 This was a gift. She loves it! Excellent quality! 
383 4 Perfect. Fit like the originals. 
384 3 ok 
385 4 Fits great and helps with the glare without blocking the view. 
386 4 Yongnuo!! you are the best!!!! 
387 1 Works well for what I bought it other that the cord it s really short! 
388 4 Purchased for my daughter and it works just fine. If you are a power camera user, you might want to invest in a higher quality unit. For the casual user the quality is fine and should last a long time 
389 4 Just installed. Good product 
390 3 Good product. Fits in the frame differently than the real GoPro &#34;Frame&#34;. Still works as designed with access to the buttons. 
391 4 fits my d5200 perfectly 
392 4 Excelent 
393 0 Dead on arrival. Light comes on power converter but the camera will not power on. 
394 4 Buenisimo 
395 2 Initial shipments got lost... otherwise the replacement or second shipment arrived as Espected. Thank you.. 
396 2 Decent lenses to start off with, definetely had a lot of dust. The zoom ring is rather sticky. The focus ring is amazing. 
397 1 Seemed like a great deal for the money, but they didn t even last a full year. Both batteries have swollen slightly (as many cheap batteries seem to do) and don t fit inside my Fuji X-T1 any more. Pretty bummed. 
398 4 Great and sturdy tripod, glad I ordered it, highly recommend. 
399 4 This was such a bargain. Paid $57 on a lightning deal and the app that goes with it is fantastic as others have described. 
400 4 Better than Nest Cam...1/2 the price...no google.... 
401 3 This camera is great for the price. It is difficult to set up, but the customer service is very helpful! 
402 4 My daughter s graduation pictures came out beautifully and it arrived on time, you saved the day and beautiful memories for me and my family thank you. 
403 3 Not the best glass in the world but the closeup lenses do their job adequately. To the naked eye, the lenses do mot appear to be coated although Hoya claims otherwise. I recommend this product. 
404 4 Great quality. I was shocked at ho easy it was to setup. The app works great to login and view from anywhere! I will buy another one...or two! 
405 4 It works. 
406 4 a little heavier than I thought, but high quality and really save my shoulder. 
407 4 110% GOOD all the way 
408 2 Cheap. Plastic 
409 4 It love the strap. It takes a lot of pressure off my neck, especially with the heavier lenses. I like that the connection piece is metal, so I feel that it will remain sturdy for many years. 
410 3 Good camera. Just wish it would zoom out to a wider field of vision. 
411 4 works , good for the money 
412 4 This product is light weight and durable. Easy to setup and folds down into a very convenient travel size into the water proof carrying case. Great value, glad I bought it. 
413 4 Works as it s supposed to. 
414 3 Great camera. Best in class for the price - although I bought my body eight months ago at $550 and now a kit is $499 - I feel ripped off. 
415 4 Great item for a great price Angel Vidaurri 
416 3 Grandson was very happy with the stand 
417 0 Had it set on a time to run during the day. Stopped turning on after 3 months. 
418 4 Everything fine, useful as expected & good delivery service... 
419 3 This battery works well lasting two hours of non-stop time lapse. 
420 0 The microphone is not sensitive enough to be an effective baby monitor. Also the app that must be used with this camera is not very user friendly. 
421 3 Try to measure the LCD first before you buy any. 
422 4 I love it 
423 2 haven t tried it yet, its on the bike but haven t put my cam on it and went for a ride yet. 
424 4 Nice strong transmitter would buy again 
425 4 I love it! And real leather so it s awesome :) I really recommend people buying this case because it looks cool and it protects your Camera. 
426 4 It worked well and even though I lost a motor in a crash. I recommend this for beginners. I m very happy that I installed them. 
427 2 It s a good clock for telling time, but not for spying. 
428 4 Great camera bag. Plenty of space for my EOS plus all 3 lenses and a digital camcorder. 
429 4 Henry was very helpful. He set everything up for me and it only took about 15 min. He also showed me how to set up and use the app on my phone. This is a great camera. 
430 0 Does not fit go pro 4 black like advertized ended up breaking my 499 dollar camera trying to make it fit-- horrible do not reccomend 
431 3 Gave me the confidence that our new underwater camera would not be lost while snorkeling. 
432 4 thanks 
433 4 Perfect solution for additional backup power for my nikon dslr. More than double the price of the no name aftermarket brands available, but it does work as described. 
434 4 A really great way to carry your camera safely while on the trail. I recently spent a week in the mountains and this carrier made the hiking so much more enjoyable. Highly recommended. 
435 3 Rock solid but HEAVY. I m 6 1&#34; and can comfortably take photos without extending the center column - I only have to lean a little. With the column fully extended, the camera platform is at forehead height 
436 4 I m 11 years old and I love making movies. This tripod works great for me because of it s adjustable hight and the travel bag it came with. With a cheap price it s easy to afford and totally worth your money. 
437 4 The excellent reviews here helped me decide.I am loving this camera for the low price and excellent quality photos. Pros and those with tons to spend may want to look elsewhere. 
438 2 Filter has a factory blemish in the glass. Just a small speck but who wants another speck in the picture. 
439 4 Very versatile. 
440 4 Good 
441 4 I have always used Cleaning Cloths and these are the best. 
442 4 Fantastic lens in every respect. Highly recommend this over other lenses that cost a lot more. 
443 4 packaged very nice, so many accessories for the deal! 
444 4 I m a novice, so I cannot say much about this from a technical standpoint. But I was able to use it with no problem, even having never touched a telescope before. 
445 4 Affordable they last more than the original batteries from my Sony a7s 
446 4 This are premium microfiber cloths at a terrific price. The delivery was extremely fast. 
447 0 Nothing worked. Returned. 
448 4 I read several review s before my purchase. The Canon 7D MK2 is phenomenal! 
449 4 Perfect, exactly as described. 
450 4 Everything is as advertised. Great product. 
451 4 Solid charger, came with a car adapter attachment which is great! Charges at what seems like an average rate based on my experience. Removable plate may come in handy if I get another camera or device that uses similar batteries. 
452 4 It is a perfect fit for my Sony DSC H20. It started working instantly. 
453 4 Good battery extended flight time 
454 4 great 
455 4 very fast 
456 4 works good 
457 2 Great for the price. However it came with no instrustions 
458 4 Excellent camera, superb crisp images and video. Multiple functions are easy to use and set up took only minutes, Best FPV camera of the year and the price makes it a great value too. 
459 4 Rugged and not bulky. Great protection. 
460 4 perfect size for all the accessories and nice padding to keep everything safe! 
461 4 Top quality product at a fraction of Canons price. Works great, with good build quality. You won t be sorry. 
462 4 As advertised. 
463 4 excellent. batterys hold better charge then I expected. 
464 2 Its a little small no extra doom in the bag 
465 4 Awesome!!! Great camera. Great price. 
466 4 My best purchase on Amazon!! I had been wanting a new camera for a long time. Totally impressed with the items that came with my bundle. Well packed so everything arrived safe. 
467 3 I install cameras for a living and this is the best camera for the money I have seen so far. The price point is incredibly low for good quality and a respectable assortment of features. 
468 3 Just as described online. Good buy 
469 4 I ve had this for a while now. Live it and it has never given me a problem! 
470 4 Wow, it s pretty great. Batteries charged quickly and lasted for a good length of time. And 2 for a great price. Now I don t need to listen to my husband complain about needing another battery. Thanks for the extra goodies too. 
471 3 Excellent for leveling a tripod. Would be great if they provided instructions on installation. 
472 4 Worked great! This is a great selfie stick. It s very compact and kind of folds into itself. Pairing with my phones bluetooth was super easy and took less than a minute.Worked great!It extends a good amount, and so now I can take selfies without the awkward angles. 
473 4 Love the pix star frame. I have bought many of these frames for gifts. Everyone loves how easy it is to set up and send emails to the frame. 
474 4 Awesome 
475 4 Very nice 
476 4 Incredible! A pleasure to look at. My husband and I spend a looong while on my daughter s bed just mesmerized by it. Strong and delicate at the same time. Easy assembly. Larger that one may imagine. 
477 3 Thanks 
478 4 Nicely made, works perfect. 
479 3 works as expected 
480 1 thing broke 
481 3 Flys very well. Arrived on time. 
482 4 Having a great time shooting with this lens. Easy to use and produces great shots! 
483 4 Excelente 
484 4 Great price. Time will tell if the quality is good. 
485 0 A complete waste of money. All photos are blurry. Shutter speed is too slow. Either spend more money and purchase a high quality waterproof camera or use a disposable underwater film camera. 
486 3 Works as advertised. Carries good amount of photo equipment - like the removable padded &#34;box&#34; that allows the backpack to convert to just a backpack if needed, and the zippered access from the back. 
487 4 Works just like I needed it to! Was really happy for the extra long cord as I work mainly with children, families, and pets which can be quick to run off in any direction! 
488 4 Item was as described and included all of the parts listed. Everything worked, and I am very happy with my purchase. 
489 4 It is a great product and it came to my door very fast 
490 4 good 
491 4 All you can Be! A+++++++ 
492 0 It is awful and a big mistake to buy such item 
493 3 Just as I expected. 
494 2 Great zoom, average quality, good for the price 
495 3 Unfortunately, I m still trying to play with the camera. It s very simple to use but I have not made the time to do so. The price is right. Have fun with it. 
496 3 Fine product, not sure how good this glass is but it works and my pics look a lot crispier and warm and I get to show the awesome blue Florida and Puerto Rican skies and puffy clouds. 
497 0 The film only works at night time. Very disappointed. 
498 3 Great 
499 0 This was one of the best products I have ever bought yet. I had to sell my siblings, house, and car to buy this but it was worth it. Jk about selling my siblings. 
500 4 Everything was as advertised. Thanks so much.... 
501 3 The video quality is great. The use of the microphone could be better. It doesn t always work. 
502 4 Great for the price! Even better I d say! Highly recommend! 
503 4 Henry took care of my camers very professionally. He was very nice and pleasant in helping me with problem. 
504 3 Works great with my Peak Design camera mount. 
505 4 Light, yet sturdy, this support system holds my heaviest backdrops without sagging in the middle. 
506 3 Works well, good quality but hard to avoid having bubbles. 
507 2 Note: this does NOT work with the DMC-TS6 camera. DMW-BCF10PP --&#62; this battery DMW-BCF13PP --&#62; what the TS5 and TS6 need (I can t erase my review, so I figured this is the least I can do to make it useful!) 
508 4 Good case. 
509 4 excellent seller and terrific sale - very fast shipping! A+ 
510 4 Nice 
511 4 Inexpensive and doing the work. 
512 2 Works OK, great power, but it overheats too quickly 
513 0 Stay away if you have a mac. No support whatsoever. I am savvy and wasted the better part of a Saturday only to have &#34;no cloud camera was found&#34; with the green lights and WPs installation failing, Stay away from this product! 
514 4 Worked perfectly with my Nikon DX AF-S NIKKOR 18-55mm GII. 
515 3 Though we have not used this article, it looks like good quality and was delivered on time. It is what we were looking for. We look forward to using it on a beach trip this month 
516 4 Impressive. Much better than expected. Other software available on Internet to allow this to be used with OSX. 
517 4 This battery is amazing! It lasts double the time as my normal battery from canon!!!! 
518 4 Good 
519 3 Works well, but the clip is about 3mm short of centering the lens on the HTC One M8. 
520 4 Great Price. They work great. easy to install. I will buy them again 
521 4 perfect adapter 
522 2 first one arrived broken, unable to shoot pictures, sent it back and quickly received another one. Works fine so far! My daughter loves it! 
523 4 Awesome system, I love that I don t have to walk over to my lights to adjust the settings. 
524 0 Wow didn t even come with all the pieces!!! What a shame I want my money back 
525 4 Well done cables. 
526 4 very good 
527 4 Fitted perfectly 
528 4 The screen protector fit perfectly, was easily installed, and looks good. 
529 4 Arrived on time and as described. 
530 4 It s nice to have something recognizable in all the extra stuff laying in a camera bag. A quick look at this sleeve and I know where my filters are. Pouch is a durable strong material. I don t see this falling apart any time soon. 
531 4 This is OEM so obviously it is good. 
532 4 Just like new. Works perfect. Touch screen can be difficult to use but that is normal for this model. Clear pictures, wifi and 12x zoom more than make up for it. 
533 1 Poor build quality and optics are poor but better than the 20-80 version. You get what you pay for. I gave them away along with the 20-80 version and bought Zeiss which are vastly superior in optical and build quality. 
534 4 Does everything it is suppose to do. 
535 0 Cable didn t work with LaView LV-KDV0404B5B cameras. 
536 4 As advertised. 
537 4 Works as described. A bit hard to install but great customer support. Main issue was Chrome browser not supporting NPAPI plug ins and needed to install newest Java version on Firefox. C6724021. 
538 2 Had issues trying to update firmware. Also found it not staying completely leveled when transitioning from option 2 to option 1. Had to re-calibrate often by turning on and off. 
539 4 The product performed exactly as advertised and met my needs very well. 
540 3 so far so good. sometimes it turns on by itself when it s in my purse - but i put it in a sun glass case to make sure the button doesn t push down accidentally. 
541 4 Good product 
542 1 Looked off, and it is a weaker model than the standard nitecore battery. This one is a 650 and normally they are 750. 
543 2 I like this light .. however where is the diffuser cloth that it said it came with???? 
544 2 Ok camera for the money. Had problems with the battery door. If you drop the camera you blow up the door hinge. 
545 4 Item is as described and works great. Prompt delivery. 
546 4 Perfect complement to the classic model Works perfectly with an F Stop Kenti 
547 4 Amazing camera and highly recommended for a beginner camera. Top notch experience with the seller as well, would buy again. 
548 4 Finally found what I needed! When on vacation I carry my camera everywhere. It is aggravating to carry camera and a purse. This works perfect. Has plenty of zippered sections to put everything in. 
549 4 The battery fits perfectly and is working like a champ. 
550 4 Great 
551 0 Advertises 12 patterns, but v only has one 
552 4 Can t have enough charged batteries on hand. This is great. 
553 4 Works like a champ! Just yank out the plastic blank, insert this and you ve got Z wave on a non-Zwave electronic Kiwkset lock. Frankly I m stunned that it was so easy. Thanks to Kwikset for the upgrade path. 
554 4 Greatly improves my lighting. Easy to use and store, with sufficient quality to use casually. Can t speak to its durability because of how frequently I use it, but don t see why it wouldn t last if used by the casual photographer. Great value. 
555 4 For $12 you get two batteries, plus a good quality fiber cloth. It shows how much it means for this company to deliver the best to it s customers. 
556 4 Super cute and fits in regular sized bags which is convienet. Buy extra film cause you re going to want to use this everywhere. 
557 4 Package arrived in good shape and as expected. Fits my Canon Rebel XSi and the rear caps fits all of my Canon lenses. 
558 4 i like how it clips 
559 2 I had to replace it after one month. 
560 2 I believe this is the same mic from Teelec for $17. It s ok but poor isolation means it picks up everything. If you don t need stereo the Tackstar is cheaper, has better isolation, sounds better, and uses aa batteries. 
561 4 Purchased this for my son, he loves it!! 
562 4 Lovely case. Holds the camera and memory card...and sometimes my keys 
563 4 Perfect fit and service! 
564 4 Everything seems fine. Battery charged up, fits camera. 
565 4 I like the tripod it s not heavy at all and I am 5 ft 90lbs. 
566 4 Fits great with out FZ200. 
567 3 Great reference quick easy and easy to understand 
568 4 Now I just have to learn how tho use it 
569 4 Love this camera. So much to learn about it. Going to take a photography class and hope to learn a lot more. 
570 4 This bag can hold the Nikon D60 and accessories and other &#34;bits&#34;. It is a super-fine camera bag!! 
571 1 Amazing that the battery area isn t big enough for the batter and you can t close the cover to the battery area. This is a poor design for this. 
572 0 It was great for a couple of hours then it broke at the point attached to the holder. I superglued it. After a couple of weeks it broke again. 
573 4 Batteries are rated at a higher level then the camera maker s battery and at a fantastic price. They charge up and run just like the OEM unit at less than 1/4 the price of a new Canon batter. Totally satisfied. 
574 1 design is sleek However, the overall illumination is much lower than earlier generation products 
575 4 Absolutely a wonderful product. Had no issues yet and really enjoy having the mobile app on my device for monitoring. 
576 4 Sturdy, strong and light. Keeps the camera pretty safe. No issue with the quality. 
577 4 Nice set, especially for the price. And bigger than I thought it would be. 
578 3 This works as advertised and has held up well in both the sun and rain. 
579 4 I works perfectly for what I need to do, which is use pro microphones with my Nikon D750 and D810 cameras. 
580 4 great starter drone,the pictures and video are unmatched for the price and so easy to fly(I have two now.) thanks. 
581 4 Very durable. 
582 2 Plastic is a bit cheap, but it works great. 
583 4 Was a gift, she uses this all the time, but was disappointed that not instructions came with this. Had to go on line and figure out where to locate them and get them/ 
584 0 I received 1 defective camera of 4 and that happened because the cable that comes out from the camera was broken due to the way it came in the box. 
585 3 Unit works fine. Instruction manual almost impossible to understand. 
586 1 No instructions. can t be too sure how it works. Useless to me. Without instructions, money wasted. 
587 4 Thanks, just what we needed! 
588 4 Love this! Took it all over Cancun through sinkholes and zip lines hundreds of feet without a worry! 
589 1 Smaller than expected. 
590 4 These are so much fun!! They go on the camera and come off easily. Make such a cute pic! 
591 4 This reflector works great speacially in the sunset it gives a really shining light to the person face 
592 4 Everything fits great. Light weight as well. Just watch the foam as you close it up. 
593 4 Gosh I love these lights. Lights like this can be super expensive but these are actually fairly cheap and offer some really nice light. Not the best build quality but hey Im in it for the lights and this delivers!! 
594 3 Nice case however it needs to be wrapped around a fairly beefy belt/strap for the loop on the back to really hold it in place 
595 4 Works great, nice clear video and not much vibration 
596 4 I used this for a baby video monitor. It was really easy to install and adjust. I tried another monitor mount a few years ago and hated it, this one worked perfectly, I couldn t be happier! 
597 3 It works well for protecting the lens while not affecting the quality of the pics on my Sony Action camera. I just wish it was more simple to put on the camera. 
598 3 The color s beautiful and it s holding up really well so far. I do wish the faux-leather pieces were thicker. Just looks a little flimsy and doesnt hold the pattern as well as advertised. 
599 3 Works good with all the working parts 
600 3 I had been wanting to try one for awhile. It was easy to figure out how to use. A little cord plugs into the auxiliary jack and then the handle extends. Takes good pictures! Works as promised. 
601 4 I have several D-link Cameras more versatile and easier to use than order surveillance this is a good upgrade. Wish it came in White ! 
602 1 Cheap product. 
603 0 Piece of junk. Maybe yours will work, but mine didn t right out of the box. On the plus side, they gave me a refund and told me to just throw it out. 
604 4 as expected.. great lens protection 
605 4 Great buy. Works perfectly, and even controls focus with half press. Outstanding. 
606 3 Plastic, but functional and will allow SONY product to use GO PRO Accessories. Price is very reasonable. Came direct from China, so a bit slower on delivery than other products ordered same date. 
607 4 Works great with my Canon 60D 
608 3 It s a good kit; however, the SM card is not compatible with the GE DVX1080 P pocket video camera 
609 4 Good quality batteries, fix perfect on my Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TX30. I am very happy with it :) 
610 4 Works great for my spray dog collar 
611 4 👍 
612 3 Absolutely no instruction on how to attach this mini soft box. After a few minutes of cursing the companies name, it dawned on me. Works very well. 
613 4 It works great!! Thanks 😊 
614 2 It Works...... 
615 4 It is nice to have the GoPro attached to the head, instead of chest, so the camera swivels with where you are looking! 
616 0 I expected a waterproof screen cover 
617 4 This is a super high quality dash camera. I am very happy with my purchase. Highly recommended to anyone that is in the market for a premium camera. Highly recommended!!! 
618 4 Good item. It doesn t make my hand sweat. I liked the material, really soft and comfortable. Fits my eos 5d M3. 
619 4 Battery has long life and charges well. No issues at all with my Canon 5D. Recommend the seller Indie Camera Gear as I received the battery quickly and they followed up with a nice personal email. 
620 3 I purchased tve as backups yo my original. 
621 4 works as described. 
622 4 &#34;love&#34; maybe not a strong enough word for this thing... after lugging around a really heavy manfrotto aluminum version.... 
623 4 Very good beginners slr camera. Very light weight and small. 
624 4 Great little air duster. Was extremely useful in getting an annoying hair off the mirror of my T3i. 
625 4 Great film. Overpriced however.. 
626 3 This camera is easy to set up. It works great as described. 
627 4 A bit too easy to fly 
628 4 So far they work great Item came when promised 
629 4 They re very cute and fit my camera lens perfectly!!! 
630 3 Clean clear picture, works great! 
631 4 Love it. Am able to spotlight Egrets in trees from about 50 yards away now in very low light. Recently got some shots of Purple martins nesting by the thousands from maybe 25 yards. See attached photo. 
632 4 works like original 
633 4 Worked fine! Just like you at a great price. 
634 4 Very smooth! Wish it included a 3/8 screw but I was able to pick one up at Lowes for 68 cents so its all good. 
635 4 this is a very high quality lens, works great with my d5300! 
636 4 Great. I am a food blogger but can take pictures mostly at night because I work during the day. With this box my pictures are really beautiful, seems professional! 
637 4 This product appears that it will do a great job for the price. 
638 4 Superbly designed and made. A must for DSLR users and/or photographers shooting with long lenses. This is my second one! I just returned from a two day air show and wearing two bodies with these made it comfortable and provided more functionality. 
639 3 Great product! 
640 4 It is perfect was here so fast loved it. 
641 4 I order a at least one pack of these every year, to keep in my camera bag. These are great quality, and a great deal! A nice touch is the email I receive from the company, after I order, to make sure that I am pleased with my purchase. 
642 4 This microphone is amazing..... Even brighter and stronger than dual lavaliers!! 
643 3 Fast delivery very nicely packaged! Impressed with how fast it charged up..very neat lil camera looking forward to recording video on motorcycle trips!! 
644 3 Good product 
645 4 Go pro kicks ass. 
646 4 Great. 
647 4 can only say nothing but great things about this! Love the footage I get when my dog plays fetch or goes swimming! 
648 3 Great 
649 4 works as described 
650 3 Very versatile lens. Perfect for travelling. You don t have to carry different lenses because the range of this lens is excellent. It could be a little faster (e.g. f2.0), but then the price would go up substantially. Works very well with Canon 60D. 
651 2 This Newtonian reflector telescope itself was quite good, unfortunately the geared adjustment assembly mounted below the scope never did quite right; making it very frustrating. Once the reflector is in position however, this reflector provides outstanding images of our earths moon. 
652 4 Microseven has very decent security IP cameras.Their support to fix issues is very reliable. I highly recommend their cameras for lower cost solution. 
653 4 Pleased with service and product. 
654 4 I find this to not be one of the most comfortable straps depending on the application, but that is not a fault of the clip necessarily. The mount works exactly as expected and I have no issues or concerns with it otherwise. 
655 0 HORRIBLE CAMERA. Takes decent photos outside but if you plan on taking photos inside be prepared to be hugely disappointed. Really disappointed with the quality of this camera. Len s cap wouldn t even stay on. 
656 4 did the job 
657 2 Minimal use so far but seems to work as needed. 
658 4 Meets all my needs very reliably and in quite good detail with the new camera. 
659 4 It works perfectly! It s easy to take and easy to use. Really love it! 
660 4 Amazing results. Now, the sky comes out blue with white clouds... Most so called Pro photographers do not use this product and the sky looks white on thier pictures. Our sky is not white... Nice product. 
661 4 in love with my camera brings 2 lenses which makes perfect 
662 3 Satisfied with this purchase, camera works fine. 
663 4 Amazing love it it fits my camera with lens 18 -55 on , a macro tube on The other side And a led light , it also have two little pockets that you can use to put some memory or extra battery, My camera is a nikon d3300 
664 4 This is great! Works for intended usage. Be aware the tripod should be handled with care to avoid any accidents with breaking it. 
665 3 great camera, now I want the newest version 
666 4 Love it 
667 0 Does not work! My router does not even see this guy and I have a powerful Trendnet AC1900. Used different freq. it s useless. Returning. 
668 3 hopefully I will not have to use this, but I feel safe having it..Thanks 
669 4 Great set, great quality, reasonable price. 
670 4 Look real and easy to install 
671 4 video is really clear and it is great for watching your house or child while away! 
672 4 nice 
673 4 Fits my monopod 
674 4 Works for long exposure photography. You would want to use this in low light situations. It works as it should. 
675 4 worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks. 
676 4 A extra battery for Nikon Coolpix AW 130 
677 4 Bruh this thing lit 
678 4 Very Good Product 
679 3 Haven t tried everything yet, but good so far 
680 3 ok 
681 4 nothing to say about pelican 
682 4 worth the money good quality 
683 4 Perfectly 
684 3 I used it on my astro master 70 and I was very impressed on how simple and fast I could see through it,,although I had to use with it the adapter that comes with my telescope so I can mount it on 
685 4 No more hitting the wall! Love it. 
686 4 Wow the best cams ever for the price super clear image and night Vision is super clear at night 
687 1 Should have a quick release rod system, very annoying to take off or move. Also does not have much height so if you have a battery grip, it will reach none of your lenses to support, even big telephotos like me 70-200 f/2.8L. Solid metal construction. 
688 4 The best way to carry and protect my Phanton III..... 
689 3 Purchased it for my 13 year old daughter. She really likes it. 
690 4 Excelent !! 
691 4 Great pages for updating my photography files Easy to use and good protection for the files. 
692 4 Great case! Holds everything I need and I don t have to remove the prop guards every time I m done using my drone. 
693 3 Works as intended, feels sturdy. Didn t end up working for me...sigh. 
694 2 It was supposed to be a product that when you put it on there d be no air bubbles. Not so. I tried several times. Air pockets formed every time. At least the LCD is protected. 
695 4 This item arrived quickly and in excellent condition. It was exactly as the way it had been described - a great complement to my new camera. 
696 4 good 
697 4 As a step up from the stock lens that came with my Canon T3i, you can definitely see a difference. Great zoom, clarity, aperture, and low price. Plus arrived SUPER FAST! 
698 4 This micro phone with a pre amp picks up slight audio noises. Becarful what you hear you may not want to know. 
699 3 You have to go online to get directions on using the camera. I m still learning all the in s and out s but the camera is a good one. And you can use a regular SD card in it, so that s good. 
700 4 Works great; a good value; just as good as a name brand 
701 4 Great case. As described. 
702 2 ok for the price,not a great camera 
703 4 GREAT PRODUCT - GOOD FAST SHIPPING - THANKS 
704 4 We ve found this works well for our baby monitor, allowing us to mount it on the corner of the crib, and to move it if necessary. 
705 4 This little thing is great, takes pretty good photo and video 
706 4 Not a big fan of the clear finish so this matte finish works great. Fits perfect! 
707 0 It didn t work for my Sony digital camcorder.. 
708 2 Info says the battery meter will recognize this pack, but it doesn t. It s fine for a spare. 
709 2 That s ok 
710 4 Love it thus far. Works as expected. 
711 0 It was awesome for the 1 hour it worked, then one of the rotors stopped working and that was that. Great fun for the little time it worked. Other than that get another drone that won t crap out on you. 
712 4 these batteries are for my Arlo wireless system. Exactly the same as came with cameras. 
713 3 works great 
714 4 does what it was advertised to do. 
715 4 The best deal. Good quality and fast delivery. Everything fits my GoPro hero 4 housing 
716 1 doesn t work very good 
717 3 great quality 
718 4 Just ordered this past week. works well, charged both batteries. Like the fact that it includes a DC adapter, it will be very handy on a long road trip. Very good price for an excellent product. 
719 2 The video quality is acceptable 
720 3 This case fits my Canon EOS Rebel SL1 with 18-55mm lens perfectly. The only shortcoming is that there is scant space for accessories. I can put two spare batteries in the front pocket but there is no place for a filter. 
721 4 Excellent product. I recommend it 100%. 
722 4 Good Gift. This camera case is great for the right size camera. 
723 4 Outstanding glass!! Not only does this lens compete with the &#34;big boys&#34;, but, in my opinion, beats the C**** 100mm/2.8 in many aspects, including flat field sharpness. The AT-X 100mm/2.8 is a contender that is worth your consideration. 
724 4 Works great for analog security cameras,( my application) 
725 4 Great when you just need that extra lens. Lots of times I don t want to carry my camera bag but want two lenses. This is small and does the trick. Perfect for street photography and outside events. Holds lens securely 
726 4 Works perfectly with the Panasonic FZ200. Easy set up. Will work through a closed glass window for those nature shots. 
727 4 I was having problems with upgrade firmware on my DVR. I called Tech support and spoke with Chris L. He helped every things what i needed. He is very great customer service. Thank you !!! Chris L. 
728 4 Just what I needed for my camera! 
729 3 I really liked this but I never got all the bubbles out. 
730 4 I wish I’d found this battery sooner. I’ve been looking for a cheaper BMCC power supply and this seems to be the least expensive out there. Also, it fits nicely on my rig and lasts a long time. 
731 3 The screen can crack easily, but it definitely works under water. Took mine to some whale shark dives; very pleased. My pictures were definitely better than the rentals the resort offered for underwater photography. 
732 1 It didn t work for me. Tried it with a Sony NEX7 and Canon lens and had mixed results. I could never get the autofocus to work. 
733 3 Great and strud for a DSLR, but the knobs/caps get loose over time. 
734 1 Glass screen came off after first use. Can t turn it off and it seems the connection might be intermittent since it seems to mess the shutter presses every 4-5 clicks. 
735 1 the advertise 53X was wrong, it is only 40X optical zoom ! 
736 4 does what it says, takes great pics. 
737 4 Very big set of GoPro Hero accessories, it includes everything you will need to use on your GoPro Hero camera adventures. Highly recommended kit. 
738 4 Best Camera ever I love it Great for indoors in low light Wish there were more lenses for it 
739 4 Everything it says it is. 
740 4 Excellent product 
741 0 Doesn t work I ve tried every battery even the orginial and the new once many times and it doesn t work 
742 4 Super fast delivery, and everything came as described. 
743 4 Ok 
744 0 I bought those 2 cameras and I only received ONE camera instead of 2. 
745 4 Excellent Camera as the picture quality is beautiful. Pointed at my front gates and no one is getting past those gates without being recorded. There is barely any light out in that area but the night vision is incredible. I would buy again if another is needed. 
746 2 Very good so far, but very expensive compared to others 
747 4 very cheap, but then again they are very fake 
748 2 The button doesn t click easy and there for it takes a long time to take a picture. Then it is hard to not have a blurry picture. 
749 4 Came in extremely fast! Awesome packaging! Great build and design. Feels good in my hands. So happy I went with this! 
750 4 Worked as expected. Not as hard to do as I thought. Used on a very dirty d7100 sensor. 
751 4 Very good works well on windshields 
752 4 I wear it as a headband. Comfortable; absorbs sweat & keeps me cool. Great in the car with the windows down. 
753 1 The head swivels very loosely. 
754 4 For the price it is the beat photo backpack in Amazon. Can not be beat. Many cushioned pockets for lenses and accessories, comfortable straps, scooped up the last one but hoping it will be in stock soon. 
755 4 Great product, great price! 
756 0 Doesn t fit the Sony HDR-cx900 
757 4 great camera, makes a great gift. 
758 4 Just what I needed for the video camera my father-in-law gave me as he did not have a charger. 
759 3 good 
760 4 Exactly what I needed 
761 4 Good price. Good quality. No problems. 
762 4 Great bag for my needs 
763 4 I bought this charger for my Canon SC280 camera. I was very pleased with the value and it works great. I would buy it again. 
764 4 This drone is an excellent buy. Easy to fly, easy to repair, fast, and decent FPV. Much more fun if you buy the charger that can charge 5 batteries at a time and purchase the extra 5 batteries. Also happy I bought extra propellers and guard. 
765 4 Good price, good quality! 
766 4 Performs like the original go pro battery at fraction of the price. 
767 3 As described except one of the light bulbs which was included was burned out. 
768 4 can t wait to use on vacation, I only had one battery and this is a great buy for the money. 
769 4 On time elinry and great srvice 
770 2 Ok for very short distance 
771 4 Canary is so perfect for me and my family, easy to use, reasonably priced, and working great. 
772 4 Just Great! 
773 0 It s OK. I just wish I had something to put in it. 
774 4 Excellent item 
775 0 I don t have anything else to say. 
776 4 works great 
777 4 Can t wait to put this to use in my classroom. 
778 4 It s a great little printer. So fun! Perfect for pics to add to my planner and record memories of the day. 
779 4 This is great for the added security needed for your GoPro and it really works great! The installation was easy and you really need the adhesive to set before using this in the water. 
780 1 SImply put, ...cheap ...cheap ...cheap. Don t waste your funds on this. 
781 4 as Described Very Pleased with my Order Thank You!!!!!! 
782 0 Telescoping part is very loose, makes phone spin around. Piece of garbage. Bought at Ross for 5.99 
783 4 Great system 
784 4 Package arrived quickly. The lens is great 
785 3 The ad needs to state that the batteries are not included but great product great price 
786 4 Perfect for filming when I needed great sound quality! 
787 4 Works great light easy to maneuver and my iPhone 6 + fits perfectly 
788 4 Great tripod. Lightweight and easy to use. Good price form Prime members with free shipping 
789 4 Worked perfect. Good price! 
790 2 As advertised. 
791 4 great 
792 4 Perfect size for the Canon Powershot SX700 for which I bought it. 
793 4 Excellence. I have 2 of these and five batteries. I cycle through them while recording. Never run out of power. 
794 4 Totally AWSOME! 
795 4 Really good product. Fast shipping. Everything fine 
796 4 I loved it 
797 4 Great! 
798 2 Faulty dial for the shutter button, just within a couple weeks of ordering this new camera the dial just fell off. 
799 3 Only complaint I have is that they re a bit difficult to put into the binoc mounts. Also, they could be a bit longer to make it easier to clip on the strap. 
800 4 The camera is better than I expected. It is smaller, lighter and shoots better video. I am really impressed. I haven t used a GoPro but I cant imagine the quality can be exceedingly better to warrant the 4-10x price difference. 
801 4 cute 
802 4 Works great! 
803 4 I lost my Nikon remote and got this one. Performs great. 
804 4 I love this top handle. So much better than the Honu handle I had for the GH4. 
805 4 The batteries held their charge for a full day of picture taking and sightseeing. They charged quickly and without issue in the charger. The included adapter for the European plug was extremely helpful. 
806 4 arrived on time and quality is excellent! 
807 4 No Problems 
808 4 Fun little device ! 
809 3 In terms of the quality of the product - it is exceptional and by far has the best image quality Sound was good as well 
810 4 Used this for 2 years and couldn t be happier!! very durable. I have used it in fresh and salt water. Great buy! 
811 4 great service, great price, superb product 
812 4 works well 
813 4 A deal for such a cool lil lense 
814 4 lightweight, and all the features an amateur photographer needs. 
815 4 Great product. Great seller! 
816 4 works great 
817 4 Works great! 
818 2 ok 
819 4 Great slider for professional video work. 
820 4 It works and is the same as the real Manfrotto ones. 
821 4 gave as part of gift bag for someone with new Go Pro and they loved it! 
822 4 Great deal and service 
823 4 👍 
824 4 It works to charge my bateery and I got it pretty fast. 
825 4 the product is great so far but the service was better. 
826 3 Very nice battery. Holds a very good charge. 
827 2 Be careful - reviews of this plug said &#34;Loved it for my QFlash&#34; = well, I didn t look closely enough, and it only has two prongs, my Quantum T5D needs three. 
828 3 Have been charged several times due to vacation and birthdays. Have held a good charge and long use of each battery. Will buy more before the Holidays. 
829 4 good product, It works very well. 
830 4 Had a cheap one that rattled and made me feel like the lens was going to fall off. This one is PERFECT! Sturdy and you can t beat it for the price! Great Buy! 
831 4 Arrived on time, great quality, I needed only 2 but it is better to have them handy. 
832 4 Great filter. It is very solid and well built. This is the second filter I have bought from Breakthrough and I definitely recommend them. 
833 1 you will get good wide angle view but in spite of adjusting all the exposure parameters, you will not see details in image. Details and sharpness is very poor. You will see lot of reviews which will say great value for price but image quality is very poor. 
834 4 It take great pictures and many features 
835 4 Great product 
836 4 great 
837 4 Everything fits perfectly into the case. Gives you room to have 5 batteries (1 in drone +4) and pocket for tablet. 
838 0 The product came with broken buttons for the up and down menu options. Also the watertight cases power/ mode button was broken. A quality control issue but I was still bumbed out because I wanted to use it right away. Will order another one and then do another review. 
839 2 Affordable mount for gopro camera BUT the screw does not keepmyour camera in th angle you want 
840 4 Excellent camera for the money! 
841 2 it is ok Does not activate far enough away and does not stay on long enough Ten feet to activate motion 
842 4 pricey but worth it much easier to hold the camera. 
843 3 It s a little small. But that s just me. This is probably more intended for essential gear you need to take with you. 
844 4 This is a great finder. Easy to use due to the erecting prism. I really like the cross hair patern. 
845 4 Got them pretty quick and they work great and easy to instal 
846 4 Perfect Fit 
847 4 good product 
848 3 the camera seems good but some of the accessories parts missing and not compatable. The camera is top heavy on the tripod. It tilts down no matter how much it is tighten. There was buckle missing on hand held grip. do I have any recourse? 
849 4 Will return to seller. 
850 4 Vincent was patient and awesome! I highly recommend the product and customer service! 
851 4 Muy Bueno 
852 3 A great buy. Cheap bag 
853 4 Super cute and good quality! 
854 4 Works great. 
855 4 Perfect. Good atention and delivered on time. 
856 3 This is a good grip for medium weight cameras but if u run lots of add ons like light mic and monitor the weight can be thrown off a bit but all the extra thread points make it great for multiple uses 
857 4 I love this camera. Unlike the other review my Minolta Hi-Matic AF2 takes regular AA batteries that are easy to find. It s a great little point and shoot camera and takes sharp photos. 
858 2 Stopped working after a few times in the pool. It was fun whenever it worked, though! 
859 4 Fit nice and snug on my GoPro 4 Silver. Filters came on and off nice. 
860 4 Great! 
861 4 This is probably the best kit you can get for the price.The packaging was great, the product and also the shipping was fast. Super happy with this purchase 
862 3 dose the 55-300 Nikon have a plastic or is it a stainless mount? 
863 4 Excellent 
864 2 ive had the phantom 3 pro for 4 weeks and the camera gimble is broke they don t have replacement parts and wont return after 30 days .. don t waste your money 
865 4 Worked great to replace the missing screw in my Sinar Pan/Tilt tripod head. This screw is used to mount a camera to your tripod head. There is a version with a 1/4&#34; screw available if your camera uses that instead of the large 3/8&#34; type. 
866 4 Item as described and fast delivery. 
867 4 Best solution for glasses wearers, unless you want to drape yourself in a cloth, like Ansel Adams. 
868 4 Excellent camera. Photos and video to prove it 
869 4 I took this lens on a trip recently and so far am very happy with it. 
870 4 Easy to set-up and I am not a wizard when it comes to electronics. i Just set up the monitor up and went out of town for a few days. Really nice to record if you want or just look around. Would purchase again.? 
871 2 Love the camera, however, the carrying case could fit tha smaller pieces of accessories. 
872 4 This is a great tripod for beginners. Very cheap and quality-made. It is stable and very adjustable. Very easy to set up and use. Very light. Worked perfect for shooting a large group! I bought it for my Canon camera and use it all the time. 
873 3 Works perfectly with my Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX50 16.2 MP Digital Camera. This case is a little bulkier than I really wanted, but it has worked out well with the attached belt loop on the back. 
874 0 This product is unable to be connected trough Internet for remote viewing. Even trought Zmodo it is impossible to update firrmware. When buying be sure that DVR has HDMI connections even if it indicates that comes with QR code. It was made for 
875 3 decent batteries, a lot cheaper than buying canon. only thing I have noticed is they don t last as long as the canon. At this price I will buy more for backups. 
876 4 Great camera for very good price. 
877 4 Yup, it fits! Very happy to find a replacement so I don t have to replace the tripod. 
878 3 Good product, a little pricey. 
879 4 Works like a charm....have scanned over 500 pictures so far and not ONE issue! 
880 4 Use everything in this kit, great buy! 
881 0 Bought this for a backpacking trip because of its light weight. Camera failed to save majority of photos. I m tossing this camera in the trash. As they say, you get what you pay for. 
882 4 everything works,video quality excellent and battery life last for more than 8 hrs. Only missing is night vision, video at night is grainy and need a good outside light. Night vision will really make this an outstanding dvr. 5 solid star for this dvr 
883 1 Very very little. 
884 3 Bought this as a gift for my stepson and it performed great in the water. Solid quality and build. Image quality also excellent. 
885 2 Lack of bottom opening access to battery and SD card is an issue. Nicely made and fits well. Binds a bit where case and strap come together. 
886 4 OEM and lasts just as long as the one with the camera. 
887 0 Junk!! Waste of money.. 
888 4 WORKS GREAT 
889 3 its pretty hard to attach my go pro as the screw is to close to the housing, but overall great product. 
890 4 I love this lens! Crisp, sharp photos. The Bokeh that this produces is much better than any of my other lenses and I absolutely love the auto focus override. I can utilize the speed of auto focus while being able to fine tune my shots without switching to manual. 
891 2 You get what you pay for.... 
892 3 as described fast shipping highly recommend 
893 3 Just big enough stretch to fit iPhone 6Plus with Spiegen Tough Armour 
894 4 This camera is PERFECT for beginners. 
895 4 good buy. on time and a expected. 
896 4 Fast focus, good low light, great lens. 
897 4 Love this. It s quick to charge, and lasts long. 
898 0 Buyer Beware: After purchasing this, I begun getting spam email from SterlingTek. 
899 4 Keep s my lenses safe. 
900 4 Just as shown 
901 3 Configuration is somewhat challenging to determine how the various components can fit into the slots, but it s doable. Very sturdy/ 
902 3 It s a bag....it holds all my Canon lenses....as well as one body.....snugly. 
903 4 Good items! 
904 3 Great price, got the job done. Versatel! 
905 1 Bot cords, the power cord and the backup camera cord are too short. Cannot hide the cords. Don t let them say otherwise. I have a Honda Accord, and both cords are too short. Mirror also vibrates a little when driving. So I will lengthen the cords by soldering them. 
906 4 Good camera for the money. The image is very clear and the night vision is bright and effective. 
907 4 This charger works quite well, love the display and the ability to swap charging amperage so I don t burn out my smaller cells. 
908 4 Henry ,good and work find ,got good tech support from foscam, it is a good camera! works great. 
909 4 Awesome camera. Took it to Jamaica and the pictures are absolutely beautiful. Thanks 
910 4 GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT PRICE. GREAT SERVICE. 
911 3 Nice strap, no instructions for installing. 
912 4 Arrived ahead of schedule and worked as expected. Good service and good value. 
913 3 Lens works well. However lens case is too small and lens won t fit in it. Lens hood is not included. It was delivered sameday. Packaging was great. 
914 4 just got it. It works on my old camcorder. very happy 
915 4 I am able to haul this with my backpack camera case. 
916 3 I rate 4 star my son told me that is really good deal 
917 4 Works great. Sturdy, yet light weight. And, the Pahntom fits with the prop guards on! 
918 4 Thank worked great. 
919 2 Bought it to put it in my Mav 88, It s ok.. 
920 1 The camera works well when tied directly to the router, but will not sync wireless. 
921 4 Very good! 
922 2 These work well but they don t look very appealing. I was able to take pictures and video with ease. However, it doesn t record for long. 
923 4 Great bag, great value. The dividers are all customizable. It does take time to arrange the dividers for a good fit though. 
924 3 Nice little TV for the car and has an HDMI input. The colors aren t the best but good enough for my kids to use it with their Wii U on road trips. 
925 4 This thing really works 
926 3 Perfect fit for a good price. I ve not tried the tripod yet. 
927 3 Excelent equipment 
928 1 it feels cheap the tripod stand is so tiny you cant set it on rocks to get a higher view 
929 4 Used for rockets and worked extremely well. 
930 4 These work just as good as my old Canon ones did for my 50 D. And I like be that there were three in this pack also the price is excellent. 
931 4 Seems fine, I haven t had a chance to really check it yet, like I want. Thank you. 
932 0 Threads were so badly created during manufacturing, the thing won t work at all. Total junk from day one. 
933 4 Excellent camera. Very user friendly. Great under water photos. WIFI photo transfer is quick and easy. Super product! 
934 4 Love it.......... 
935 3 This was a deal and it works very well. Thanks! 
936 0 Product overheats under reasonable use (1-2 hours), making it completely unsuitable for professional use. Was using this for a high-profile shoot with a celebrity and it started flickering and turning on and off every second. Ruined the scene and embarrassed the crew. Faulty product and should be removed from Amazon! 
937 3 Ably and amply holds my Sony A6000 with larger lens attached. Standard lens and wide angle lens fit comfortably and easily (even with Neoprene cases) in side pocket. Lots of other pockets for sundry items. It is larger than you would think, but gets job done for me. 
938 4 DREAMY!!!! I love this!! We ordered three of them to cover the walls of a 10x20 tent and we got so many complements! Very nice quality and I love the pocket at the top for a rod! Made putting it together a breeze! 
939 4 It is my carry everywhere camera! Love it! 
940 4 I was interested in the Arca Swiss quick release feature and didn t need the Olympus battery/control of their accessory. This works perfectly. Finish and fit are perfect. An added bonus over the Olympus add-on is that the battery and memory card can be accessed without removing the base. 
941 4 Cool....... 
942 0 This LCD protector: This protector was useless, without adherence to the screen of my Alpha 77 II and the bubbles made it impossible to display the same. It was necessary to dismiss it, total loss. Excuse me. 
943 4 It worked great. Thank You... 
944 4 Great 
945 3 Good... 
946 3 i love this camera it will notify you if heard a sound or movement also it will email you setting can be changed 
947 4 Perfect battery... perfect seller! 
948 3 fine 
949 4 Great action Camera 
950 4 Bought this item for the same reason I purchased the small gold/silver mini reflector. (To photo small collectibles) Easy one handed operation for that little extra light one sometimes needs. 
951 4 Product worked perfectly for my purposes (replacing original factory battery for Olympus Stylus 1050SW). Battery is actually slightly more powerful than the original. 
952 4 Bought this for my daughter-in-love for her birthday. She absolutely LOVES it. So it works as she expected it to. 
953 4 Always good to have an extra battery...And here you get two batteries and a great charger. Never leave without a backup fully charged battery when going to shoot your awesome pictures. 
954 4 Good if you don t drop it! :) 
955 4 It was exactly what I ordered. Works just fine. 
956 0 Stay away. This program for product is awful and takes FOREVER 
957 4 Great kit! Perfect for use with the gopro hero2. It has everything my son needs to get him started making great videos. 
958 4 This was a great birthday gift for our daughter, she took it to an outward bound week and it went white water rafting, under water in the case and did fine. We are really impressed with the picture quality and would definitely recommend. 
959 4 Great little lens! It s so wide that it s sometimes hard to keep your feet out of the shots. 
960 1 One blade stopped working after three days. Have not been able to use it since. 
961 4 Having a hard time getting it to work but pretty cool item 
962 4 I use this lens on a D750. My photography experience is very limited but I am enjoying myself. I use this lens for landscapes. 
963 4 Exactly what I was looking for. Now I will never run out of battery again. 
964 3 One problem....there is no information to refill the pen ink when it runs out. Now I have a pen that does not write anymore. Thanks seller! 
965 4 Excellent camera!! Received it within a week of ordering it. 
966 4 Great to have 
967 4 Works great with my Nikon batters and makes storage of them so easy!! 
968 4 Best gift ever. My son used it all summer long in Florida Very easy to use and great picture/video 
969 4 Very good quality and speed for the price 
970 0 Was not impressed with video, there was no per say instructions and no phone number to contact for support 
971 2 It s neat but I wish it didn t save only to .MOV files. 
972 3 Great product! 
973 4 very good product. My Asus R.O.G. 17.3 fits very well. And the charger also and a cordless mouse 
974 4 very good 
975 0 Not designed for someone with arthritic hands. My niece seems to like it 
976 4 Product was as advertised. 
977 3 Works Good, Great Value! 
978 4 Really cute camera. 
979 4 This is my 3rd device. Easy to setup. Video lead to the capture of 2 people who burglarized my neighbor 2 doors down. 
980 4 It was exactly what I was looking for 
981 4 Excelent price，unbeatable combo. 
982 2 So so... 
983 4 Just what I needed 
984 3 Great sound and picture for such a small unit. Battery and switches are a bit touchy on occasion. 
985 4 Works great! 
986 4 Everything is good 
987 4 I bought the small and it is a great size and easy to pack in my backpack. I own a sjcam sj5000 (gopro clone) and it fits perfect. Great product and reasonable price. 
988 3 Works fine. 
989 4 Completely satisfied with the quality of my order. 
990 4 Excellent 
991 4 GREAT BUY 
992 4 Very happy!! 
993 2 The lens cap is functional and works just fine but the hood lens doesn t quite fit properly. It has fallen off already. 
994 4 Exactly what i wanted, great price, quick shipping 
995 4 Nice kit. Exactly what I needed for my camera. 
996 4 Love all the features especially the motion sensor when I walk into the room. Nice display. Easy to use. 
997 0 Broke after two weeks. 
998 4 This was a wedding present for my grandson and his wife. They love it. They promised me pictures to come in the years ahead! 
999 4 Perfect for what I needed!! 
1000 4 Used to have a 10 x 50. This is great...just a little havier for brid watchers... 
1001 4 Works great. 
1002 2 Its alright,as first camera. I needed it for YouTube videos. But audio not so great. I have to talk loud for recording. Video quality is great though. 
1003 1 Works ok color is really poor but for the money its ok 
1004 1 A cheap filter isn t worth the loss in image quality. 
1005 0 instructions are terible have not found any good ones online yet not shure how it will work need better instructions 
1006 3 Works great! 
1007 4 great 
1008 3 Good price! 
1009 1 The plastic thread is horrible, I tried it on my different lenses and I can t get it to work properly. You can t really tighten it up as the plastic won t allow it. Just a waste of money! 
1010 4 great 
1011 4 Beyond its entertainment values, Baywatch has enriched and in many cases helped save lives. - David Hasselhoff 
1012 4 sturdy! my wife loved it!!! 
1013 4 Thanks for including good specs, it fits well! 
1014 0 Pretty frustrating. Frankly, just didn t work. hold the button, red light comes on with blue light, goes out, never able to get a single frame of video recorded. Instructions read like an old Japanese Godzilla movie script... Not playing with this one anymore, sending it back! 
1015 0 Does not work 
1016 1 im not happy, the cable gets out. need a stronger closer 
1017 4 So far so good. I ve been using it for macro work and it works great. Anytime you need a shot when you fear touching the shutter will throw everything off, this is for you. Worth the money. 
1018 0 doesn t fit as original one fits, cap is falling off quite often 
1019 4 Excelent 
1020 4 Will return to seller. 
1021 3 Keep these in the camera bag as backup. Seem to work fine. 
1022 1 I wanted to like this camera, but sand got under the shutter button the very first time I used it at the beach. Back it went. If you need something for the pool and not the beach, this would work great. 
1023 4 This camera is amazing. The images are crisp, and the camera is easy to use. 
1024 4 Nice case 
1025 4 Looks pretty good! Worth the price! 
1026 0 Do not buy this. I didn t even receive the same model as in the description and it barely worked. After the first time I charged it, it worked for ten minutes and now nothing. What a disappointment. 
1027 0 They are not following through or doing what they claim. For two months now they said they were couldnt fix but would pay out the claim. Nothing they said has been true. No camera returned and no payment 
1028 0 wasn t impressed with it, doesn t find focus that fast. returned the next day 
1029 4 Love it! 
1030 4 like it 
1031 4 Fits my Nikon D3200 and any filters I have on the camera. Good price and fast shipping! 
1032 4 Very satisfied arrive as promised and was easy to set up support was great 
1033 4 love it 
1034 4 Same as the battery that came with the camera and lasts a very long time. I used this in my Nikon D5500. 
1035 4 Shipped quickly and exactly as described. Great deal, thank you! 
1036 4 Attached to my deck rail to install the Netatmo rain gauge. Works well. 
1037 4 So far so good! Have had these batteries for only a couple of weeks, but so far so good, They do the job. 
1038 4 I already used it on my glasses and on my TV screen and it does what it promises. Great product. Will recommend this product 
1039 4 The strap was a tad large but it held the camera securely during my horse back riding excursions and regular pool play. 
1040 4 This thing is brill! 
1041 3 Items for my friend and my family arrived well packaged and earlier than estimated delivery.We take it for family use to record cherished moments. After a few days usage, I really think it is worthy to recommend to you.It is really funny and useful device. 
1042 4 Looking at it now and works well 
1043 3 Nice everybody like exploration 
1044 3 I have not used the very much. I am still experimenting with them. However I am satisfied with them so far. I do not expect to have any problems with them. 
1045 4 Worked exactly as advertised. Great product! 
1046 3 disappointed that it was plastic petal after being reviewed as ALL metal. focus is pretty stiff. not tack sharp... 
1047 4 Loved this case! It worked perfectly and did the job. Pelican makes a very good product. Shipping was awesome and fast. 
1048 4 Unit works well and is OK. I should have read description more carefully because I would really like a battery operated unit. 
1049 3 amazing product 
1050 4 Was shipped faster than stated. Very pleased with purchase. 
1051 0 Didn t work right. Pictures were blurry with lens attached to camera lens. 
1052 2 It does what it is designed to do. It s not very portable as you have to disassemble it every time. Once you figure out how to do it it s ok. You could easily put your eye out if one of the rods slip out of your hand. 
1053 4 Great product. Easy to install. 
1054 4 Great product at a very affordable price, kept my camera nice and dry when we got caught out in a storm unexpectedly last weekend. 
1055 4 exactly as described. works great would buy again 
1056 4 Still learning how to use this but it is very well made. I see it as having the potential to really improve my moving shots. 
1057 0 Battery would not charge 
1058 4 Ok but I m still not relaxed enough to use it!!!! 
1059 4 Pretty easy to fly I m a beginner and once I could once I figured out the software it was pretty easy 
1060 3 Works pretty good 
1061 0 Do not buy this product. It stopped working after a few shots. I bought tried out, the next time I pulled it out of the bag it quit working. 
1062 4 I have a 3+ and realized the itch on the original case cracked right before a trip so I ordered this one. Fits my 3+ perfect and has a different style latch so we ll see how that does. Shipped fast 
1063 4 This camera works great, used the 44 optical zoom with great clarity. The only drawback is there was no software or user manual but I downloaded the manual from the website. I would recommend this product to anyone and I am very satisfied with my purchase. Thanks! 
1064 4 Very sturdy for the cost - I was surprised. Not enough for my Nikon D700, but *perfect* for my Sony a6000! The built it ball head is great, too. 
1065 4 cant go wrong. Excellent product for protection and peace of mind 
1066 0 Arrived broken 
1067 0 Bought two and gave one for a gift. Neither one was usable due to the Go Pro screw not being able to tighten all the way. The unit will not stay in position. 
1068 0 pule s*** 
1069 3 Great Pole buuuut its too expensive! The thumbscrew seems poor quality 😒 anyways i like its transparent😀 and Looks beautiful 
1070 4 Works great with my Sony a58 camera. I wish it had a power button though so I could turn it off when I wasn t using it. 
1071 4 It s very good , clear and works wonderful. I thought it was a little bigger but works great. 
1072 4 Birthday gift for my son. He really liked it for his voice recorder. Fast service. I actually received it sooner than expected. Great job 
1073 0 This did not work for my Canon T3 even though it said it would. I m disappointed. 
1074 4 It was perfect. Thanks 
1075 4 Just what I needed 
1076 4 Pleasure doing business with! Everything as promised! 
1077 2 This camera worked fine...until I updated to Windows 10 then it didn t work. Disappointing 
1078 4 My brother is a photographer and loves it. Uses it all the time for different kinds of shoots. 
1079 4 Quality and price very good. 
1080 4 As a wide angle lens for the Nikon 1 V2 this lens performed very well giving great color rendition and pin sharp photographs. 
1081 4 Unlike anything you ve ever experienced 
1082 4 Effective, light weight, great quality and compact. Will easily collapse and fit in the case it comes with. Great to create highlights or a catch light for one person. 
1083 4 As advertised 
1084 4 Works very well. This really helped us see what our dog was doing during the night. He is having health problems and it helped to see his behavior all night. 
1085 2 good 
1086 1 Easy to use, video and audio quality is very poor. 
1087 0 piece of s*** 
1088 4 works PERFECT!!! ARRIVED VERY QUICKLY!! 
1089 4 What a great package deal. The DJI P3 is one awesome quad. Just add a case and a cell phone or tablet and you are ready to have the time of your life. It is fast and responds very well. The pictures and video are impressive. 
1090 3 Good product, delivery on times, I like it ! 
1091 4 It came just in time for the vacation trip to Sedona, Arizona. With a 20-50mm kit lens, the pictures was amazingly clear and sharp color rendition. 
1092 0 The charger only charged the battery 2 bars and completely died in 40 minutes I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!! 
1093 4 my last camera bag.. 
1094 4 Best Photo gear I own. 
1095 3 exactly as advertised. shipping was a bit on the slow side, though. 
1096 4 Exactly what I needed. Fast delivery! 
1097 4 works flawlessly with HDMI. Use it with media device as well as computer. 
1098 4 Product was great arrived on time and was packaged sufficiently, it didn t solve my problem which was my internet connection itself but it worked great and did as i needed it to 
1099 4 Works as well as a new OEM battery should. 
1100 4 Amazing lens!!!! Highly recommend 
1101 4 Very nice quality. 
1102 4 Great for the price 
1103 4 Worked perfectly as described - my kids and I loved being able to let our waterproof camera bob around in the water and not worry it would disappear! 
1104 4 Works very well, positions camera in a good spot and holds it there. 
1105 4 Like all the other reviews, this is awesome! 
1106 1 The velcro came ripped and I ll need to do something about that so I can put it on my belt or something 
1107 4 Good deal. Warranty card wasn t included, but you can easily register on the Canon website. 
1108 4 It works good. Just what I needed. 
1109 2 Lesson learned; look at the length of the stick. This one is a little short which I was a little disappointed. Yet Ive learned to play with it and captured a good shot. 
1110 4 Excellent 
1111 4 This camera is exactly what I wanted/needed. Would recommend to anyone needing a point a shoot. Zoom is perfect for me, color is great. Love it! 
1112 3 Love this thing. Brought it with me to bandcamp and had a lot of fun with it battery life leaves much to be desired but photos arebshotnin 4000x3000 and video in 1920x1080 so I can t complain much. 
1113 4 works good and keeps my go pro secure when needed. Thanks!! 
1114 3 Both work good! the only problem is the locking knot dose working properly, after locking in, sometime have to force to unlock it! 
1115 3 They do a good job of cleaning. With six of them, I have one where I need them, most of the time. 
1116 2 Quite frankly, I m a little disappointed in the picture quality of this camera based on the price I paid for the camera. Plus the video has to be transferred into a different format before it can be edited. 
1117 4 Great when you need your camera perfectly straight. Works great 
1118 4 Fits my camera fine and improves the imsgrs while shooting in bright sunlight. 
1119 4 Great buy! My 16 year old photografer is very Happy with it. Delived at home really fast. Thanks 
1120 2 No instructions. Camera must be in manual mode with you making all the adjustment. 
1121 4 It is ciik 
1122 4 Love this camera! 
1123 4 Good unit! Preforms very well at a good price! 
1124 4 I love it! I like the video option on the camera. Great blue color. 
1125 4 Came Quick. Exactly as represented! 
1126 0 Stopped working after several months. 
1127 4 ok 
1128 1 Received and the snaps began to pull apart one by one. The canvas is nice and the bag is roomy enough but the quality of the securing snaps is very poor. 
1129 4 Love the large size, great for wrapping around large cell phone to protect while in pocket. And keep another in car to wipe touch screen. 
1130 4 It work great. It is simple to use. Now the printer results match the computer look. 
1131 4 I can take pictures which is very beautiful! 
1132 4 This battery s work perfectly with my 6D, and my60d 
1133 4 Most places charge much more for these batteries, work good on my camera. 
1134 0 Not that effective. 
1135 4 Love it. It s light and sharp. Nice to go with my new a7R-II. 
1136 4 The single best buy I have had for my telescope 
1137 3 works great! 
1138 2 Works okay. Could be better 
1139 0 Broke after 15 mins 
1140 4 This is a good security system. The PoE is what really sold me. I had some cable runs that were long, so I used standard cat5. The cameras give a good clear image. 
1141 4 This device works without a hitch. 
1142 4 Fabulous for the price, especially compared with the Sony OEM version. Does everything at a fraction of the cost. 
1143 4 Love this lens. 
1144 4 Great security camra 
1145 4 My daughter was happy. 
1146 4 Very happy with this purchase, have too many options but I know now that make the right decision, Ultra light, very handy, very very bright, shoot nice pictures on the darkest places 
1147 4 Just what I needed so I could see what the GoPro was recording. Fit perfectly. 
1148 4 Very pleased by the performance of this little camera. 
1149 4 Great for taking quick snapshots and easy to carry around 
1150 3 Works well, packaged well and delivered faster than indicated. The only reason for the minus one star is that it has no cooling fan. It may not be a problem but I am a little worried about longevity without the cooling fan so I am going to install one myself. 
1151 4 This is a outstanding deal. 
1152 4 this is a very nice set - I was glad to have a way of recharging my camera batteries away from 120v power. I was really just looking for new and higher capacity batteries, but the charger turned out great. 
1153 3 Great product 
1154 4 I used the gold reflector with the shoot-through open for a Chicago senior session. I lovvvvvved the warm tones! I ll never used anything else. 
1155 4 bought this item to repair an old school wireless 900mhz. alarm system that I could not find anywhere else , shipping was very fast ,product was exactly as described thanks again 
1156 4 as advertised 
1157 4 Fits perfect, works perfect. 
1158 4 This is currently the single greatest bargain in quadcopter / drone. You get a Pixhawk, controller, and a very stabled, well tuned machine for an extremely competitive price. 
1159 4 great sound 
1160 4 Great Buy ! 
1161 3 It arrived as promised and as described. Unfortunately, I was looking for something else. My fault. I thought it was going to have more magnification. Next time, more research needed. 
1162 1 the buttons are small and I cant tell if I am recording or not. 
1163 4 It s the best buddy when I travel alone. 
1164 4 Works as advertised. All Olympus camera functions work. 
1165 0 I bought this a while ago and it doesn t even turn on I hate it not worth it save ur money 
1166 2 Seems to work fine, but instructions are not clear for setting up features. Box and sales brochures said the camera did NOT not include an SD disk so I purchased a separate one; but there was one in the unit when I received it. Other than that, seems okay. 
1167 4 A great affordable, alternative option to a pelican case! 
1168 4 excellent 
1169 1 Quality weak 
1170 0 As others have stated the punch out holes do not punch out easily. You end up beding the box. Would not recomend this to anyone! 
1171 3 I purchased this item as a holiday gift. Won t know how well the boy s like it until Christmas. 
1172 0 Though we used guidelines it was the wrong adapter. Unfortunately we purchased two. 
1173 4 works great but I rarely put on my Nikon Lenses. The camera is so small and the lenses are so big. 
1174 0 The package came with a chest strap, not a head strap as clearly shown. The goose neck is not very robust, the gopro-clip side broke on the first try, did not even get to use it. I m scared to use the camera holder, I m afraid it will break. 
1175 2 Oki 
1176 4 I was skeptical of the reviews, but they were telling the truth. It s all metal except for the leveling bubble. This will last me a long time. 
1177 4 Thing is awesome...I am bringing mine to Burning Man next week. Going to strap it on to my back and riddddddde! 
1178 4 great bag got it for my girlfriend she can bring her camera gear very easily when we go out 
1179 3 Whale watching in Alaska it was handy to have the zoom feature. Image was pretty steady even without a tripod. 
1180 4 Very good camera. For a small/compact camera, it does a great many things. Way better than any camera I have had before! 
1181 4 Very Good 
1182 4 great 
1183 4 Super easy and fast set up. Great picture quality. Great/simple phone app. Excellent range of view. Wish you could record video locally but subscription is reasonable price. 
1184 4 Had it for 2 months and it is amazing at everything! 
1185 3 Came exactly as promised and works just like original. 
1186 3 good design - very functional 
1187 0 I hate this pole. If fills with water every dive (I ve logged 50+ in the last year). Also, you can t extend it underwater if needed. I would recommend another. 
1188 4 I love it 
1189 4 Items received on time and as described 
1190 4 Excelente. 
1191 4 Very nice case for the DJI Phantom 3. It is sturdy and seals up really well with 4 latches. The case has a pressure equalizer which is very important when traveling. It is also very roomy. 
1192 4 It s Perfect! Worth The Purchase and the price ! 
1193 4 Excelente. 
1194 0 Got lens error on third use! Do not purchase!!! 
1195 3 I use this to record for YouTube. And for this price the quality is very high. I m pleased. 
1196 4 Great power output 
1197 2 need more room. side pockets are small. 
1198 4 Well made and a great design. 
1199 4 Bought one for recording my instrument playing. Really love it. Light weight; sturdy; About 4ft Great product 
1200 4 It is very nice , I like it a lot. 
1201 4 best deal for film! 
1202 3 Great buy and was delivered fast. So glad i found this to protect my camera when not in use. Great deal. 
1203 2 It functions well enough but it is too short. When I use it I get a sore neck. 
1204 4 Awesome 
1205 4 Received as new 
1206 4 Not much to say here, works as expected. 
1207 4 Good product 
1208 3 Sensor works great. Chimes are loud. However, there is no way to set the chimes to a continous mode. I would prefer something that requires me to turn it off. This product is perfect for a retail situation to know if someone has walked in your store. 
1209 4 great camera and easy to use. Nice features. 
1210 4 As advertised 
1211 4 worth the money 
1212 0 This may work perfectly with most cameras. But it was worthless with my Pentax K5 and K3 ii. Just acted weird. I tossed it in the trash. Pity. 
1213 4 Muy bueno 
1214 0 this camera introduce a loud noise to my PC .... I can t solve this problem 
1215 4 Awesome camera want a few more 
1216 4 Thank you 
1217 4 A must have for any camera bag. It s good enough for everyday shooting and cheap enough to replace if it should break. 
1218 4 Love it, and it fits my camera perfectly 
1219 3 Arrived on a slow boat from China but everything works like it should. 
1220 3 Worked well with my camera, thanks. 
1221 4 I often leave my DSLR home. I have made great vacation videos with this. I use one charger and most of my electronics use AA batteries. Something that is not easy to find these days. 
1222 0 Buy original Canon parts. This part will not stay on my camera. I have given it a few months and every single time I pull my camera out of my bag, the eye piece is missing because it just falls off. Does not fit 5DMk3 correctly. 
1223 3 Haven t used it too often as yet, but seems to add a multiple of camcorder hour use in comparison with the smaller OEM battery that came with the Panasonic camcorder. 
1224 2 Battery life is short. 
1225 4 Excellent transaction! All was as promised 
1226 4 Works as advertised. Charges my Nikon batteries. 
1227 4 Wow, this picture is great for the money. 
1228 1 I wish I hadn t bought it because every time I have to change the battery it turns into a whole process to remove the cover. 
1229 4 Wrks 
1230 4 Makes shooting pictures for a still image so much easier for the unsteady hand. 
1231 4 love it. my 1st Tamron lens, getting a fish eye lens extension for it as well. 
1232 4 Henry was very helpful and fixed all my problems. My Foscam FI9803P is working well again. 
1233 4 Well made and works well. I did find that wearing the pack caused my lower back to get sore. To remedy this, I used the shoulder strap to help support the weight of the bag.... as I should have from the start! 
1234 1 I would recommend an actual finder scope, but if you need a reflex finder the reviews clearly indicate that the Telrad is the way to go. I have this one, and it works OK, but that s about it. 
1235 1 Difficult for an amateur 
1236 2 the selfie stick is horrible. lots of the screws dont fit easily. The clamps dont fit easily. but you do get what you pay for. every thing works, i just had to brake it in. 
1237 4 Love it! use it for action sports 
1238 1 worked well for about 6 months, and then something inside popped, and now it doesnt work. the warranty is a lie, as yognuo customer service doesnt exist. just invest in a higher quality flash and save yourself the time! this is my 2nd one ive burned thru this year! 
1239 4 CMOS sensor is much improved. Impressed with the auto focusing speed of the video capture and its quiet. Pictures are sharp in lightroom. Solid for an intermediate camera 
1240 4 Coolest thing since sliced bread!! Amazing product, I highly recommend this! 
1241 4 great 
1242 4 Just I expected - works great and looks terrific! 
1243 4 Perfect for my Minolta 49 mm lenses. I don t use the tethers because, at this price I ll risk losing one now and then to avoid the lens cap dangling from the camera. 
1244 4 Great for what I needed it to do. Thanks! 
1245 4 nice gift 
1246 4 ;) 
1247 4 Arrived on time and in perfect working order. Would use them again. 
1248 4 It works OK. 
1249 4 Still using them. Great product. 
1250 4 Have had my strap on my canon for about 6 months now. I adore it! 
1251 4 Working just as great as the the original... 
1252 4 Great product! Fast service. Works perfectly! 
1253 4 great 
1254 4 Works perfectly with no degradation of quality. 
1255 4 Works perfect in my camcorder. 
1256 4  
1257 4 Great value along with a one year warrantee and information to contact the seller via e-mail and web if you have any issues. Great daytime pic and much improved night vision as well. Will be buying more soon. 
1258 4 Can be carry on as a case or a back pack which is convenient. Very light as mentioned. All accessories including drone with props and prop guards fit in all in place well supported. 
1259 4 I am using this case for my Hasselblad 500c along with 2 backs, a viewfinder, Zeiss light meter and two rolls of 120mm film. I feel protected with my equipment. I have also spoken to Pelican reps in California and have been satisfied with their customer service. A win-win. 
1260 2 Consumes batteries too much 
1261 4 This works great. It keeps the camera dry and easy to access all the components. 
1262 3 Love it take great pictures !!! Something that u have to have 
1263 0 Very disappointing, did not work as good as advertised. Camera works ok as a monitor but trying motion recording is poor at best. 
1264 4 Thank you very much! 
1265 4 Works great no issues 
1266 4 Protection for my camera. 
1267 4 great products. Thanks 
1268 4 Love it 
1269 1 Meh. 
1270 4 I am very impressed with the quality and design. The comfort design for the shoulder (padded very well) will make for enjoyable photo sessions as I enjoy hiking while taking photos of Nature. 
1271 4 Great Item. Highly recommend. 
1272 4 Super easy to install and setup. Much better than the older versions of their systems. 
1273 4 This item is sturdy and holds tight without being uncomfortable on my children. I have kids ages ranging from 1 to 6 and they all loved it. I got some amazing and adorable footage using this mount. 
1274 2 The tripod would be great for a small camera. This doesn t hold my DSLR camera real well. The legs want to slide out from underneath the camera. 
1275 4 Did its job. 
1276 1 returned it due to bad photo quality .. 
1277 1 Strap broken. Good while lasted. 
1278 0 for some reason the batteries dont last very long.. i buy i kit of 3 pieces and one of them drop the shoe metal part.... 
1279 2 it s alright 
1280 3 Works great. The little stand broke pretty easily when it fell from a desk onto carpet. But it still looks good in a simple frame holder that I had. 
1281 4 I purchased this for a Nikon D7200. The first one that was sent out defective, but they made good on it with a return. I am well pleased with it. It fits great and is thicker than I anticipated, plus it came with a small one for the control panel. 
1282 4 The product arrived on time and as described. Great to do business with you. Thanks Rusty 
1283 4 Us this to mount a 7&#34; monitor to a Canon Vixia S20 Mini Hot Shoe. Works Perfect. 
1284 4 This met all our expectations! It is so easy to change attachments and the directions help to figure out what piece goes with what attachment. Highly recommend this kit for anyone looking for an affordable kit for the GoPro! 
1285 4 Super system, quick to install and peace of mind. 
1286 4 Great life saver for your Nikon DSLR. No more nervous shooting waiting for your main battery to die! 
1287 4 Once I receive the cameras and hook them up it was very easy to hook them up and they worked as good as I could hope that they would ! I have no issues and I would purchase them again ! 
1288 4 Great! Just for wrong type of camera. 
1289 4 This is a great deal and highly recommend it because you WILL need extra batteries. You can never have too many! 
1290 3 Works great other than quite a few false alarms tweaking its location may help that we will see 
1291 4 Love this backpack! ! Plenty of room for all my gear. 
1292 4 Great deal works awesome! 
1293 0 fell off all the time 
1294 4 Good price point and does what it s suppose to do. 
1295 4 Works good. 
1296 4 The film is hard to find and certainly did the job that we intended. Would gladly purchase it again if needed. Pierce Camera price is not cheap, but fortunately in this case, you do get what you pay for. Five stars. 
1297 2 Smaller then expected but not to bad wish I got a bigger once... Not bad for the price! 
1298 4 Great! Snug fit, very heavy duty case. 
1299 4 Like this charger better than one that came with camera 
1300 2 The fit is a bit clunky compared to the original -- but it does work. 
1301 0 Terrible! Barely fits and doesn t show good quality. Very disappointed. 
1302 3 fits firmly basic lens cap 
1303 4 perfect fit 
1304 2 The Targus version works better, but this one s OK. 
1305 4 Very happy with the quality of this strap. The Leather is soft and high quality. It also included two metal rings and small protective leather pieces which I hadn t noticed in any of the product descriptions. Shipping was quick! 
1306 4 Great camera. Timely delivery. 
1307 0 Cameras stopped working after a few months. 
1308 4 Love my new square compact camera! It s cute, made in Japan, and has one of the best resolution and display of the compact cameras market! 
1309 4 Very good quality! Looks great! 
1310 4 Works well 
1311 0 I don t like it It doesn t work 
1312 3 Great product, worked well. 
1313 4 Works with my Sony Action Cam. This bag of trix is really helpful with accessories and attachments for the Sony Action Cam. Since Sony does not make a lot mount accessories I purchased this and worked well! 
1314 1 Ok. Not worth the time. Just get a macro lens. 
1315 4 Very good quality. Love that it has audio. Really love that i can watch it from my phone! ! Fanatic cam!! 
1316 4 This is my electronics travel bag for trips. Perfectly carries all my gizmos and camera with great multi compartments and sections for everything! 
1317 4 Just what I needed. Not the brightest one, but serves my need. Excellent quality. 
1318 4 All my life I have wanted a good Nikon SLR camera, MY wishes have finally come true. Absolutely love it. 
1319 4 Great buy! 
1320 4 cannon eos rebel t5 DSLR camera I have to lean this camera its been a while sine I used my eos rebel 35 mm camera so this one is new to me 
1321 4 Great Rig Works As Advertised! Good Build Quality For The Money. 
1322 0 The plastic buckle snapped in half when latching the case closed. I ve only had this for about four months. I ve just purchased an aluminum one, I hope it last longer then this one. 
1323 2 It s ok. A bit awkward. 
1324 1 Very grainy video. Not an original sj4000 as advertised. 
1325 4 DVR has good quality recording and was able to set up app on android phone for remote viewing with no issues. 
1326 4 I can turn on/off the shed security flood light from inside the house at 110 feet away. My double pain hurricane proof windows did not adversely affect it s performance/range. 
1327 2 Product has lower quality material and workmanship 
1328 0 Fuzzy picture, more like a toy! 
1329 4 Inexpensive filters that do a nice job 
1330 4 Great camera 
1331 4 Excellent Flash. Output was amazing. 
1332 4 This is my &#34;go-to&#34; camera for everything photographic. I like it because it does everything Sony says it does. Also, it takes all my old Minolta autofocus lenses with no problems. Saved me a lot of money in that regard. 
1333 3 Decent camera with good options. 
1334 4 Nikon IS the BESTthat IS a fact. And for this little GEM of a camara, I cannot express how vivid the clarity in the pictures are!. The ease of use, zoom, edititing for even more beautiful pics, and an ALL OUT 5 STAR Camara! LHH 
1335 4 #1 it works great for CCTV CAMERAS 
1336 3 Lots of acc. for little cash and pretty good quality for the money. I have not had a chance to try the suction cup mount yet. 
1337 4 smart way of standardize the power adapter. good value and quality! 
1338 4 Exactly what I ordered, durable, and compatible with what it claimed. Couldn t be happier with this no brainer purchase. 
1339 0 does not fit my camera 
1340 4 Epic 
1341 4 Nice basic cam bag. 
1342 4 I placed the order yesterday, it arrived today, everything was as described, and no missing items. Perfect order. 
1343 4 Heads above the cable that came with the camera! (BTW the camera is a $600 camera). 
1344 4 Love it for semi pro use. 
1345 4 Got this product for my 12 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it!!!! Highly recommend this product!! 
1346 4 The camera works nicely with my iPhone and I m able to remotely control it as advertised. Foscam Customer Support was very helpful. Danny assisted me with clarity and precision. 
1347 4 Very good! 
1348 4 Lost mine, had to buy another. 
1349 4 Nice 
1350 4 good 
1351 4 Good 
1352 4 excelente 
1353 4 I recommend, fast delivery. very good 
1354 4 Worked great. No problems and yes, they do show the battery monitor. 
1355 4 My camera did not sink to the bottom of the ocean. Mission accomplished. Use two with your one camera for extra buoyancy. 
1356 0 I do not trust the reliability of the suction. My camera is very valuable to use this. 
1357 0 Barely worked at all before dying completely. Wast of money. Find something else. 
1358 4 Does what it says it does 
1359 4 I bought this used. But surprisingly there wasn t any scratch on the lens nor there was any sign of use. It was like new!! performance is as expected. Satisfied. 
1360 4 Thank You! 
1361 4 Thanks. 
1362 4 Worked great and kept its charge. Also loved the extra charger (although it does take longer to charge than if it is on the camera charging) and other extras it came with. 
1363 4 works well for my ipad and phone. 
1364 0 in a pack of 10 shots, 2 were defective. I paid full price for only 8 shots... 
1365 4 Solid every bit as good as a GoPro, took a ton of vacation videos and photos including under water with no issues. 
1366 4 A nice step up from my K5IIs which finally gave out after taking close to a half a million bracketed shots. I like this camera body enough that I think I will keep from throwing it into the ocean. 
1367 0 Item missing 
1368 4 Ya gotta be careful applying it but it is the ideal product to protect your screen and at a great price to boot ! 
1369 0 Does not record many videos on motion activated and shuts off, even after charging for 2 days, lasts about 4 hours 
1370 4 Great Product 
1371 0 Wasn t what I expected it to be 
1372 4 Love these. I ve had them for 2 years now with no issues. They work with both of my off camera flashes. 
1373 4 This is a tool I should have bought years ago !! This has saved me hours of cursing and scratched lens rings.. 
1374 4 Awesome 
1375 4 A great head for dslr 
1376 4 excellent perfect 
1377 4 Excellent price and fast delivery. One of the best optical zoom cameras you can get. 
1378 4 I purchased this for my wife and she loves it. It was just as shown in the ad. All good equipment and of top quality. 
1379 4 Works great as intended! Even used it in conditions where there is condensation and even though it gets a little damp, no issues yet. 
1380 3 Good flash, great alternative if you re on a budget! 
1381 4 just great 
1382 4 Awesome! 
1383 0 This product is rediculouse it doesn t even focus properly. 
1384 4 Meets my needs for storage of Memory Cards 
1385 4 great camera. Took on our vacation and worked great. 
1386 3 The zippers look cheap but until now they are working great. I have made a inside foam core to arrange my stuff. 
1387 1 Be sure to test. Lost my waterproof camera the first time it was used on the river kayaking. One would not even slow it down as it sank out of sight. 
1388 4 Does exactly what it is supposed to do--distribute the weight of camera and lens more evenly, making them appear lighter when walking around. Simple one handed operation easily lifts camera to eye level for use. 
1389 4 Great ip camera have 3 of these and one of the 720p cameras work great and would recomend sight hound software for pc to anyone with these cameras 
1390 2 I think the hardware is great but the software is complete trash. This device is unsuitable for security due to the fact that the motion detection has not been enabled in the app yet. Push notifications for motion detection does not work. Returned and refunded. 
1391 3 Great kit for the price 
1392 4 Good price, my daughter loves it. 
1393 0 Dont buy this due to use product not even brand new! 
1394 4 Great product at a great price. Fits my Nikon CoolPix perfectly. 
1395 3 was ok nothing special 
1396 4 Gets my white balance in check when I film. Very useful if you make videos or if you shoot portraits in uncontrolled lighting environments. 
1397 3 held up nice at the beach and on kayak trips 
1398 3 Good lens, met my expectations. 
1399 4 Thank you 
1400 4 Comfortable to carry, well thought out spaces inside. Seems pretty robust. I bought this via a friend in the US: I wish they sold them in the UK! 
1401 4 Was exactly what I paid for and received this item quickly! 
1402 0 it broke 
1403 4 Great 
1404 4 Everything they said it was, fun to fly and takes great pics 
1405 0 This fan was not anymore powerful than a $20 box fan from Walmart. Way over priced. I returned it and the seller charged me a 20% &#34;re-stocking fee&#34;, totally disappointed and I STRONGLY recommend that you save your money and do not purchase this item from Cowboystudio...waste of money! 
1406 3 Not bulky at all and everything fits. Might be kind of snug for some people, but I would much rather have it just barely large enough for comfortably carrying. 
1407 2 It s OK, I was hoping it was a little smaller but it works fine functionally. 
1408 4 Works just fine. No problems. 
1409 0 Crap quality 
1410 4 Perfect as any Canon stuff 
1411 3 Great camera just that occasionally my pictures do not fully or don t develop 
1412 4 Using on my Fujifilm S1. Great product. Love the quality and the price SO reasonable! 
1413 4 really nice, makes your cutting edge digital camera look like the legendary cameras of the fifties and sixties. Also protects delicate, not to mention sophisticated digital contents. Very nice, beautifully made, probably worth three times the cost. 
1414 0 when the magnet is stuck to the back of the nest cam it breaks night vision. I haven t tested with the dropcam only the newer nest branded camera. Don t buy if you want the night vision to work. 
1415 4 Great quality device. As most Bosch products generally are. I have installed multiples of these units and after 6+ years they are still in use today. 
1416 3 The cases are nice. They work nice for what I use them for. 
1417 3 Very nice bag, quality meets my expectations. 
1418 4 Good strap, seems well made, comfortable and fits the 3300d great 
1419 2 pictures aren t as clear as I thought they would be but could be my camera. 
1420 3 A little see through but not bad for the price. 
1421 4 Long life battery. 
1422 4 Excellent!!! 
1423 4 Just what I needed! 
1424 4 works well 
1425 2 Very cheaply made....the light itself is great but the actual piece feels like a toy. And the piece that connects to camera or hand device is very very difficult to use. 
1426 4 Very convenient to have these extra batteries when using my gopro. worth the money. works great 
1427 4 Perfect. 
1428 4 Works well just like the old one I had before I lost it 
1429 4 This is such a cool little product! I m having a blast playing with it and I m amazed at the difference in my photos. 
1430 4 Quality seems good, fits drone and accessories very well, foam seems good. Little steep on the price, but has made my drone use much easier. Also, this is not a bad thing, but know that it protrudes from your back quite a bit as any done backpack probably will. 
1431 3 still learning how to use it to it s full capacity 
1432 4 Nice 
1433 3 Better than the built in mic, not outstanding audio quality but it s an inexpensive improvement. You will likely have to experiment with your audio input controls to get the best quality and reduce hiss/background noises. 
1434 4 So far, it s great. Does everything I want and at such a lower price than a GoPro. All in all, THANKS 
1435 0 The coordinating strap with pink stripe makes it. Unfortunately, it is not included or available as the picture is shown. I returned it. 
1436 3 have not had to use it 
1437 4 beautifull kit!!!!! excellente!! 
1438 4 my wife is a selfie nut 
1439 0 Did not meet my expectations because product was poorly manufactured and was not durable. I was excited about using this product but never had the opportunity because it fell apart as soon as I attached my Gopro Hero 4 to it. 
1440 1 fall apart too easily 
1441 4 It s a really good quality harness and fit my fat dashund mix 
1442 0 Camera stopped working the same day it was installed 
1443 0 swings - very loose 
1444 4 the piece fit my camera with no problem will be buying another for my telephoto len thnxs 
1445 4 great kit for those looking to recharge batteries for box mods and several other types. 
1446 4 works well 
1447 4 We bought this for my husband s family in Kazakhstan. They love it, very clear photos with little to no effort. The camera arrived very quickly, in time for our trip. Highly recommend. 
1448 4 Henry was very helpful in setting up my new camera .and the camera looks really good and remote works really good very happy 
1449 4 Worked well I have no complaints did like the yellow tips. I received them relatively short period of time. 
1450 4 Great, works perfectly 
1451 4 Great lens, bought it for macro use with a few of my extension tubes. It replaced my 50mm f/1.8D beautifully! 
1452 4 great, I have had fun using these for pictures after our family vacation 
1453 4 xcellent by, much better than the original one 
1454 4 Excellent cameras and so far the best I ve had. I own 16 cameras on a two 8 camera system. Here is one of them just take 8/23/15. 
1455 4 Very convenient and allows you to take pics with one hand. 
1456 4 Excellent. 
1457 4 Works perfectly to My scope 
1458 3 haven`t had these long enough to give a true and final rating but give me a little while and I`ll let you know. 
1459 4 Arrived on time and looks like it work as advertised 
1460 4 Easy to use 
1461 4 This is a great kit. Includes everything to get started (and then some!). The video camera is an exceptional value for a 4k video camera. 
1462 4 I ve tried everything in this kit on my gopro hero. Works great. 
1463 4 Bought this new brand of CPL out of curiosity and found it to be of very good quality. I see no difference between this and my trusted HOYA Pro1 CPL in picture quality and the build quality is also good. Looks like this one would become my new standard. 
1464 4 good 
1465 4 Love it! Came with everything, works great! Pictures area a bit tiny but nothing I m concerned about considering I just wanted the camera for little albums of memories I can show my kids later on in life. :) 
1466 4 who would thought great device for studio setting or reportage 
1467 4 I bought this as a present for my fiancée who says she simply loves it. It does it a really good job for her, it s relatively simple to use, takes really good, clear pictures and gets the job done well. 
1468 3 It is a simple piece of plastic that hold one slide that lets you aim it toward the light and see the image on the film. It does exactly what I expected it to do in the simplest way possible and that is what I like best. 
1469 3 Truly a great lens for the price. The Nikkor 14-24 is better overall, smaller, lighter and performs better. But for $1000 more. 
1470 4 Great lil Light, Fast Service....Exceeded expectations! 
1471 4 This camera has been very reliable and fun to use. The projector aspect is ok, but not needed for my purposes. I like how compact it is and how good the quality is. 
1472 4 Excelente. 
1473 3 Works very well. The only downside I have noticed is that the pads on the clamp easily come off and can be lost. I will be glueing them on. 
1474 4 Geart price & quality for Gimbal head I use it with my Nikon 200-400mm. 
1475 4 These is a nice tripod. It s very light weight and easy to carry around. 
1476 3 Fit nice 
1477 4 Good product 
1478 4 A beautiful keepsake box that holds a lot. I used it to put away memorial items for my son who passed away recently. The wording on the outside says it all. I love it. 
1479 4 Works Perfect 
1480 4 Don t know how they do it this camera has it all for 62 bucks 
1481 4 Easy to use!! 
1482 3 GREAT LENS CAP....!!!...Plain and simple... 
1483 2 nice kit but it would have been better if it came with cleaning solvent also. 
1484 3 Came in very handy while diving and snorkeling, camera kind of flopped around a bit much at times though, would be nice if you could reign it in a bit while not shooting. 
1485 4 Excellent product, fast shipping. Buy without hesitation. 
1486 4 Cool I have received this product from UP Review Program. This product really bring our cellphone with a waterproof bag out of water. Its function is very nice. I m loving it. 
1487 4 Perfect size. Feels sturdy and does the job. Recommended!! 
1488 3 Cheap quality but it s a great start for me. It s not pro but it does the job. 
1489 4 every good batteries they last a long time 
1490 3 Dosent last as long as the canon batteries, but for the price a good option 
1491 4 Love the item and the seller. Nikon Battery arrive fully charged and ready to be used. 
1492 4 this battery fixed my camera and I am very happy with it. Just want to say Thank you Amazon for helping me out 
1493 4 Works perfectly. Now my pictures print exactly what I see on my computer screen! 
1494 4 This lens is really amazing! Took it our a couple nights to take pictures of the stars! I did buy it on BH. Not because of a price difference. Only because I knew for sure that I d get a new lens from BH. 
1495 1 Honestly I m really disappointed in this boom, or maybe my expectations where to high, don t extent it compleatly out, it will not support well. It s not terrible, but for neewer... It s not great either. 
1496 4 Very good frame mount, works well on my gopro hero 4. Use it everytime. 
1497 0 LENS LOCKED UP INTERMITTANTLY. HAD TO REMOVE BATTERY TO UNLOCK. 
1498 1 they dont work at all,cam wont focus no matter what lens i use,i wish i cold return it but i cant because ill have to pay for shipping. 
1499 4 It works! Fits my Panasonic 14-140mm f/4.0 lens (the older 62mm version... not the new f/3.5 version). I lost my lens cap somewhere in Cuba, so I m happy to have a lens cap again. 
1500 4 love this camera, so far so good. 
1501 3 I was disappointed it did not come with a lens cap 
1502 4 Better than gopro battery s and last longer 
1503 3 The cameras are good and I happy with it 
1504 4 Really heavy duty case great for demos! 
1505 4 Perfect! 
1506 4 Great product!! 
1507 4 super easy to set up! awesome quality! using it for my desk at work to display all my many photos of my son! great price too! 
1508 3 Beautiful item 
1509 4 nice 
1510 2 Works great but did not realize it can be harmful to the human eye. This should not be used as a baby cam, IR light has been reported to cause eye damage even with closed eyes. 
1511 4 Está funcionando correctamente. 
1512 4 The best buy I could make to Cameta Camera provider through Amazon. The camera Alpha 77 II, the18-135 MM LENS and all acesories... I am very happy, so glad and thank you very much. Five Stars!!!. 
1513 4 Husband likes it. 
1514 4 This LCD protector is amazing! It goes on crystal clear. It s great don t have to worry about scratched screen highly recommend it 
1515 3 They work quite well. Now if I could do as well. 
1516 4 Really great little travel lens, giving a good balance of image quality for its weight. Not bad macro capability for such as small lens. 
1517 4 The Canon battery back outperforms the imitators. Go for the real deal. 
1518 4 Haven t tried them yet but I have no doubt that they will be just fine. 5 stars that they are as good as if not better than the original gopro accessories but half the price. 
1519 4 they worked as they should! will buy again! 
1520 4 seems to work as advertised. 
1521 0 Doesn t come with a tripod adaptor , is hard to screw on but over all is an okay products. Disappointed about the tripod adaptor since that was the main reason for me buying this 
1522 4 Started my camera right up and I was able to retrieve pictures. The camera had been misplaced for almost three years. 
1523 4 So much easier than the previous color match system I used. 
1524 4 Items were as described and very satisfying. I would recommend this to anyone and I would also buy this again. :) 
1525 4 I love it. 
1526 2 The color of the camera is nice but the overall build is a bit poor. 
1527 3 Tech support was exceptional. I called D-Link and had a very positive experience with two technical support folks, Genevive Abolos and Lyn Cano. Both of these young women were awesome in getting our cameras up and running. 
1528 4 Everything you need for a go pro is here. 
1529 2 It s okay for the price, though I ve found lighter battery mounts since buying this one. 
1530 4 This product does exactly what I need it to, and it works great! You can focus from the remote, and then the shutter releases with a harder push, which is very convenient. Love it! Can t wait to use it instead of the self-timer! 
1531 0 Stopped working already! 
1532 0 not worth anything but a kids toy 
1533 4 Got exactly what I expected. Smooth transaction. 
1534 4 A great case for the Sony HX90V, although be aware that there is no real space for extra battery or card 
1535 4 Works well. Charged the Canon battery as weill as the one provided. 
1536 3 Great price, used this item on vacation, took great picture...the WiFi is slow to connect. 
1537 4 Works Great 
1538 4 Very sturdy with all my camera s. 
1539 4 So cute! I love it 
1540 4 exactly as expected 
1541 2 When these units work, they do the job fine. The fly in the ointment that I have found is they seem to be finicky about working properly on a regular basis. 
1542 1 Only runs two hours. What s that going to get you?! Understanding enclosed set of directions was a waste of our time. Googled further instructions, got the things working but found it insufficient for our needs. 
1543 4 I love it! 
1544 4 Really well made. Smooth rotations and adjustments are easy to make quickly. Solid hold. Great value product. 
1545 2 Doesn t look as good as the real ones. Putting batteries and seeing the blinking red light is stupid. I have never seen a dome camera have a red blinking light? It should do the job though until I can afford real cameras. 
1546 4 Wonderful!!! 
1547 4 perfect! 
1548 1 I bought this but the camera itself doesn t work. Even though I have a new sdcard 
1549 4 Works great!!!! Probably the best accessory I ve purchased for my Hero 4. 
1550 3 Simple, elegant, can stay on my monopod, which doubles as a walking stick for me. 
1551 4 Great product, fast shipping!!! 
1552 1 Loss of resolution 
1553 2 Everything fits but as soon as you modify your P3 (gimbal guard, etc) you start to have problems ... 
1554 4 Great filters 
1555 4 Great quality. Thin design works fine on my 18mm–50mm zoom lens with no vignetting. 
1556 1 I purchased it for my Canon Cool Pix S6900, but it wouldn t even zip shut. 
1557 3 great little sharp lens.I feel like the rubber cap is going to fall off sooner or later. 
1558 4 Camera is great! No trouble any all. As good as my $300.00 Canon!!! 
1559 1 Doesn t fit snug enough. 
1560 4 Nice quality cloths. Comparable to the one I got from my optometrist. 
1561 4 If you already have an essential bag for carrying your dslr camera than you will want to grab a cleaning kit. This kit is fantastic for a person who is very careful with their equipment. Awesome selection of tools for the price. 
1562 4 Worth the money 
1563 1 really too small, I will have to get a larger one to fit the camera better 
1564 0 :( Mine doesn t work! I tried everything, it came on once and never worked again! What do I do? 
1565 4 Bought this for a Canon 5D MkIII......works great!..feels like better quality than the expensive Canon version. 
1566 4 These cleaning cloths are the best I ve found. I am especially pleased with how well they clean my eyeglasses without leaving streaks. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a good microfiber cloth that doesn t leave streaks. 
1567 4 It s always nice to have an extra battery that s always charged incase This worked for my EOS 7D cannon It works perfectly 
1568 4 Light duty. Great product. 
1569 4 After taking images with a Mead 8&#34; and Canon T2i of objects such as the Orion Nebula, I am quite satisfied with this product.Thanks. 
1570 4 The set has all I expected. great price 
1571 4 Great batteries for camera. 
1572 4 LOVE LOVE LOVE it and can t beat the price 
1573 4 TOTALLY satisfied. Thanks Bunches for still having the film. Very happy camper. I am 
1574 4 A very fine piece of optical equipment. Much more than I expected. 
1575 4 Shiped ahead of time .AWSOME 
1576 4 These sensors work very well. Installed 3 of them and getting ready to install 3 more. 
1577 4 Works perfectly so far. 
1578 4 It works great. 
1579 4 I really enjoy this lens a great deal, its sharp, pretty quick to focus in good light, lots of light gathering power because of the f1.4 aperture, and its really not that big. It also is nicely balanced on the Fuji xt-1. It is almost just right 
1580 4 I have early dementia and my wife believes I am walking in my sleep. This item works great. I do not want anyone in this apartment building to see me naked in the hallways. No one should be subjected to that, plus we would have to move elsewhere! 
1581 0 Purchased 2 cameras; one would not turn on and the other would turn on and go through the whole set up process, but then would not switch to picture mode. Once the set up was done it would turn it s self off. I returned both cameras. 
1582 3 it works 
1583 4 great product 
1584 3 You get what you pay for One of them was with dislodged fake lense But easy to open the cover and glue it back. 
1585 4 Great product and prompt shipment! Thanks!! 
1586 4 Very good. Very pleased. Bought one that was three times more than this one, as my first one, but this one is the same. No difference than the higher price one. This is a great deal for your money. I give it five stars. 
1587 4 still using after 2 years. love it 
1588 4 Awesome camera. Quick delivery. 
1589 4 Present for my daughter and she love it so much. 
1590 4 Love this equipment 
1591 4 Not bad for the price 
1592 0 Doesn t snap in place 
1593 3 Great accessory for the Go Pro ;) 
1594 3 this thing is crazy fast and is like having a robotic falcon hunting drone 
1595 4 Great for a all purpose camera. 
1596 3 Was what I expected and accomplished the features a little larger than what I want but I have an alternate when needed for that. Very versatile tripod/monopod that is light and small. 
1597 3 It is made well and fits. I only wish the size was marked on the barrel. 
1598 4 I only use BW filters after this 
1599 2 video is excellent , but audio is really bad. 
1600 4 Works perfectly and made in USA! 
1601 4 Good 
1602 4 This is a good little camera. I bought 2 of them and checked on my family and dogs while I was out of town. It worked well. Video is quite clear, too. 
1603 4 Great 
1604 4 Sony is great but overcharges for accessories. Charger and 2 batteries work perfectly at a fraction of the Sony price 
1605 3 Great battery so far... 
1606 4 Good for use with the Zoom H4N digital multitrack recorder. Legs secure nicely at various heights and I have never had an issue with the thing falling over or risking breaking my recorder. Good value for the money. 
1607 4 Vincent was VERY helpful with correcting an issue I was having and explaining everything to me. I m excited to use this camera 
1608 4 I ordered this for storage of tattoo guns. They fit perfectly and it keeps them safe and sound from outside dust etc. I assume it would do the same for a camera, but it works great for what I needed it for. 
1609 4 Great buy for a starter kit. Nothing has broken so far and I have taken these accessories multiple trips 
1610 4 Good bargain for price.. 
1611 4 Awsome 
1612 4 I love this tripod. Works great for starting out Youtubers. It s great quality for the awesome price! 
1613 4 Great! 
1614 4 Works well 
1615 1 the battery is worthless!! charge it at the house by the time you get somewhere the battery is dead! all the stuff is cool but can t use it???????? 
1616 4 These are the large size 6 1/2&#34; x 3 1/4&#34; which I prefer over the smaller one. Price was the selling point at $10.00 for 15 books that about 65cents a book. Great add-on item if you are purchasing enough stuff for free shipping. 
1617 4 Awesome clarity for a pocket microscope. 
1618 4 Much cheaper than Canon quality is the same orbetter 
1619 4 Great case 
1620 4 as described fast shipping highly recommend 
1621 4 Easy use light weight and does the same things my larger cammeras do. I miss the change of lens to wide angle 
1622 4 For the price awesome, piece of kit clarity. 
1623 0 makes photo blurry 
1624 0 I just bought this camera to replace my missing camera thinking I would find it.. I used Sunday and it was so out of focus I needed pictures about my crafts and they were unusable. I bought another one from Best Buys. 
1625 0 Size is decieving 
1626 4 Generic replacements, at a great price. 
1627 3 I Like it 
1628 4 I expected the film to come in a big box but oh well. 
1629 4 Hard to find a silver colored filter, this fits the bill nicely. 
1630 1 Way too heavy for the Phantom 1. Sucks power from the battery twice as fast, and rarely keeps the camera fully leveled. 
1631 4 Excellent performance. 
1632 4 Great dog, bought two. Try to get two more. 
1633 4 Product was as advertised. 
1634 4 I liked this ones a lot it keeps my camera out of scratches 
1635 4 Item was delivered as described and works perfectly. 
1636 4 This system works great. lower quality than expected but works great! 
1637 1 didn t fit 
1638 4 Great Items.. My customers are really happy... 
1639 4 Great camera for FPV. It arrived in two days as expected for Amazon Prime. Setup is a little confusing but a search on the web found good settings for outdoors. The mounting bracket made it easy to install on a 250 size quad. 
1640 4 These are the correct and original Olympus batteries for the OM-D M5. My experience: Third party Olympus batteries require a different charger, and tend to get stuck in the camera after they heat up during use. Avoid! 
1641 4 Great deal and works great! 
1642 4 Excellent camera, and great items with the bundle. Small compact camera with clear photos even at full zoon. 
1643 3 This product works really good but you have to be careful what you hook it up to as the Nikon cameras can only take so much over load on them. 
1644 4 try to find a better one at this size and price...and wireless transfer to android cell flawless... 
1645 0 got the cord really fast but as soon as I took it out of the package it dosent work I tried muliple outlets and compuers and nothing. this product sucks!!! 
1646 4 The BacPac performs really well, very happy with it. 
1647 4 Love this product so much that I got two. It is very sturdy and protects cameras and or cell phones perfectly. 
1648 4 Works Great! 
1649 1 The charger has green light on as soon as you plug it in and stays that way even after you insert a battery into the charging port forever. There is no way to tell is the battery has been charged or not. It seems like a defect. Not recommended. 
1650 2 Good idea. Easy to install, can control some camera functions from phone. App disconnects from camera often, wish I could set the receiving folder on my phone, would like to be able to delete photos on camera using app. 
1651 2 Great value - it is what I expected for the price 
1652 4 Great Camera , Was Missing a part, but made a phone call and Rear View Safety shipped the next day. It was a easy install. 
1653 3 The video quality is excellent...however, I receive too many notifications outside my zone. I have tried everything and it still picks up motion EVERYWHERE. I guess that s better than not being notified at all. Overall, a great camera for the price. 
1654 4 Super simple super easy great product for great price 
1655 4 worked great... 
1656 4 The color had to be adjusted a LOT for indoor use with my lights! 
1657 3 Great camera. Very easy use seems pretty durable so far. Have not will not take it underwater. I think it would do fine tho if seals are clean and preped correctly. 
1658 0 I bought and didn t liked it too small. 
1659 0 I thought the glasses will have the camera like spy glasses but turn to be normal glasses 
1660 4 Thank You. 
1661 4 Works as stated. 
1662 4 What a bargain these r wonderful 
1663 4 works good 
1664 2 Works but has issues. 
1665 2 The charger is just like the 1$ on china, does the job. The battery isn t lasting like Canon genuine after 1 year use. 
1666 4 The strap looks really good came early quic I like the materials 
1667 4 It is exactly as described. I would deal with this supplier again 
1668 4 Very good charger. 
1669 4 I bought this for my camera,fits perfectly,very satisfied with the purchase,item fits perfectly,seller did great 😁 
1670 0 Power adapter is not compatible in US. 
1671 4 Great film! Love this camera! 
1672 4 perfect little bag that easily fits a camera with a 18-55mm lens, speed light, mini tripod, spare batteries and more! 
1673 4 I enjoyed using the products it makes my photography stand out even better 
1674 2 the one-step NFC does not work. playback for any recordings or pictures after having done any 4k recording often requires restart of unit due to choppy of freezing of playback 
1675 4 I am a free-lance professional photographer; love the resultas of this film 
1676 4 Excellent addition to any lighter weight tripod for closeups of flowers, etc in the field. 
1677 0 Stopped working after a week! Called to have it replaced with new dvr or fix the one i have...was told to email proof of purchase and never heard back. Called again and was told same thing. Now i have cameras up and no working dvr! 
1678 4 Great Product, Would buy again 
1679 3 Dont lose the quick clip. 
1680 4 Received well but had some problem with the courier cuz they came in during lunch hour and the slip was misplaced. But finally got the package... No problem so far 
1681 4 Works well. Batteries lasted for amount of time expected. Quick delivery. Thanks. 
1682 4 Great value! Makes a great gift! 
1683 4 Great quality as expected from DJI. 
1684 4 we use this as a doorbell for work 
1685 4 it worked perfectly, i haven t had any issues with this product. 
1686 3 A little bit big for small filters. 
1687 4 great 
1688 3 Good sturdy metal, threads onto Pentax DA 300mm lens nicely. Only 1.5 inches deep - wish it was 2 inches deep for my lens. Minimal packaging - only a bubble-lined paper envelope - surprised it didn t get bent during shipment. But maybe that shows how sturdy it is! 
1689 4 Bought this a few days before a trip to Wisconsin Dells. It was everything I hoped for and more. The photo quality and video quality were perfect. Underwater photos were perfect. Overall I am very impressed with it. And for the price I d choose this over Gopro. 
1690 3 It works perfectly and has added new dimensions to my photographs. Very happy. 
1691 4 Great cam !!! 
1692 4 This helps so much when taking my photos. It seems like a non-need, but it s really worth it. Super easy to use and set up. 
1693 3 charges fully, keeps a charge and is a great addition to my camera bag 
1694 4 just a total luxury treat for myself. Love it - it s beautiful. 
1695 4 Great paper bought it to go with my Polaroid ZIP mobile printer. It does have the sticker back so you can stick your pictures anywhere! 
1696 4 great product, so easy to setup. 
1697 4 So far everything about it is great. 
1698 4 Perfect for my needs! Use this for backdrops for product photography. 
1699 4 Kenneth at Foscam was very helpful in reestablishing my camera s connection. Cameras work well just fall off line once in a while and need technical support to reconnect. They are accessible and helpful. 
1700 0 I am not quite happy with this case. it is softer than I except and when I put in it my cigarillos they come out flat. I am disappointed... 
1701 4 The order and delivery went well. The item was better than expected. 
1702 4 Looks like the real deal when strategically placed, Great price !!!! 
1703 4 works great to keep your camera and batteries together while a road trip. 
1704 4 Good up grade from Mobius lens A. A little wider field of view for FPV. 
1705 4 works perfectly. 
1706 3 I like it. Feels weird wearing it as a clip on. 
1707 4 Completely satisfied with this product and service from Goja! 
1708 3 Met expectations 
1709 4 works fine 
1710 4 This does what it is supposed to do; what else is there to write? 
1711 4 Good product, good price, and arrived early. 
1712 4 I m using this with my iPad, Nikon D3300, 2 lenses, and a bunch of other stuff. It really holds everything well, and the sling strap is awesome. 
1713 0 I just received my &#34;new&#34; Fuji X100T. The problem is that the camera was used. It had 900 shutter actuations on it, was covered with fingerprints and the iniitIal set up process (time and date) had already been performed. 
1714 4 Needed this to run an old Lenovo ultrabook because I could not change the battery. 
1715 4 Bubba did good on delivery and product. The alarm works great. 
1716 3 Good batteries, nice charger, right price - but they are not recognized by my Canon 7d. 
1717 0 Poor quality 
1718 3 Satisfied with results as of today. 
1719 4 Perfect addition to my camera collection! 
1720 4 Field of view is a bit limited but you can buy a VERY cheap iPhone fisheye attachment to put on it and BAM excellent camera. 
1721 0 Did not fit on my T3 or my T5I. not happy with it. They are collecting dust in my closet right now. Really was looking forward to them being a great addition to our cameras.:-( 
1722 4 Love it 
1723 4 Fast shipping, order 100% accurate, Thanks! 
1724 0 Every time I put the cassette in with the battery; it rewinds and pops up. Had to let it run for second and then remove battery to work. The on/off switch doesn t seem to work. 
1725 4 Very impressed - we re not &#34;techies&#34; but wanted a good quality, easy to use camera and this one seems to fit the bill nicely. 
1726 1 Poor image quality and very poor instructions - none. Returned item.... 
1727 4 Everything was as described. It is very easy to use and was just what I needed. Thanks 
1728 0 No idea what this is supposed to do. I purchased it as a gift for my husband. The item is charged and it does nothing. A total waste of money. 
1729 4 Great for indoor and on the go! 
1730 4 It was great!!! 
1731 4 Works fine. 
1732 4 Received then fast, charged them up, ready to go! 
1733 2 The product was as I ordered the only thing that it didn t come with were pouches. I had to purchase the pouches seperately to accomidate the 19 filters. They come in 2 boxes and are individually wrapped. Other than that I am very pleased with the product. 
1734 4 I like it 
1735 4 Battery and wall charger work perfect, I haven t had fit problems with the battery in my Panasonic FZ28. I really like the miniature tripod too. Haven t used anything else yet. I loved that this was cheaper than other sellers just selling the battery for $20. 
1736 4 Right size, lightweght and well constructed 
1737 4 Working great and should accomplish what I intended for it to do. 
1738 4 Great product, fast shipping! 
1739 4 Very nicely made filter. It is a VERY tight fit for my Orion 6&#34;, but a tiny amount of trimming on the inside pads corrected that. This filter does not tint the image. 
1740 4 I have such a great fun with this camera! Everyone just loves it! 
1741 1 Hard to set up. Many times refused to accept password. Finally worked on WiFi to phone until I unplugged to move to permanent location. One plugged back in and reboot, can no longer connect. Will give support chance on Monday. If no luck it goes back. 
1742 4 Just received my GoPro Hero 4 Silver edition camera. I have heard so much about it and unboxing anything shipped to someone is probably one of the best feelings about online shopping. Everything is as expected and I can t wait to go on adventures with this new camera. 
1743 3 ok 
1744 4 Very happy to receive and use this product. Thank you very much 
1745 3 I am happy I can still get film for my 16 year old polaroid! Very happy with the product! i wish it came with more film though. 
1746 1 Description needs to be clear that a lens adapter is necessary. 
1747 4 Delivered on time and performance was exactly what was promised 
1748 4 Good value 
1749 4 Excellent product. thanks 
1750 4 I was completely overwhelmed with the amount of assessories that came with the camera. I am completely satisfied and would definitely recommend this product 
1751 4 Product received quickly and was as expected. 
1752 4 Reasonably priced lens protection. 
1753 3 Camera is great, but there wasn t a lens cloth included as advertised. Do these sellers ever read the reviews? I don t think so. 
1754 4 Looks and works great, and they gave me extra rods (new stronger flexing rods) 
1755 4 The set up paper work is great for set up a Phone But need more imfor for installing the cameras and DVR Over All it is work great 
1756 3 It was a wedding gift for my best friend....She just loved it. Great Product! 
1757 4 awesome 
1758 2 The adapter for the battery is delicate and i have t &#34;force&#34; a little the battery to make it take charge. It was very cheap and i guess it does its job but the quality of the materials of the adapter are not the best. 
1759 4 Great! Fits my Canon Rebel perfectly! 
1760 4 Very good product 
1761 4 Never got the 32 gig card..... 
1762 2 This item didn t come with a glass protective screen. It would have been nice, if it did. 
1763 3 Gift, child is happy. 
1764 3 A little bit cheap , but hey , guess what , it s cheap !!! Do what is suppose to , yo don t need an expensive stand to do what is suppose to , if you want a better one just pay for an assistant 
1765 1 Came is a package that was crumpled up and the stickers are all wrinkled really bad. I m afraid to try and put them on my drone with all the folds in the stickers. The need to ship this on a hard cardboard sheet. 
1766 4 My Professional Cleaning Kit arrived on the day it was supposed to be delivered. Everything was in the package just as advertised. Glad I made the purchase. 
1767 0 Product did not arrive as described. Did not fit the battery that description said it would. 
1768 0 Literally used it 2 times and the. It stopped working. I buy from Amazon all the time too so this was a super disappointment. Luckily it was only 8 dollars. 
1769 4 I very much like this case. It fits, protects and secures the Sony HX90V camera. The look of it is smart. 
1770 4 Awesome product, bright and clear optics, I can clearly see shots on paper at 100 yards at my local range, I would highly recommend this monocular. 
1771 4 Easy to use and portable. Can be used with many power sources in the field 
1772 0 Unfortunately, the plate came without the screws and locking pin that attaches the plate to a camera as shown in the photograph. I have requested a refund and ordered a plate directly from Redrock Micro. 
1773 4 Great Product. FANTASTIC SUPPORT. Buy it. 
1774 4 All batteries work just like the GoPro battery. Highly impressed actually. I expected to get shorter running times but they are right on par compared to the GoPro battery. would and probably will buy again 
1775 4 My son asked for this for his Fuji camera for Christmas and he loves it. 
1776 4 Very nice charger in compact package. Works very well. 
1777 4 This case was a nice upgrade from my old bag. As the number of lenses grew I needed something to carry them in from shoot to shoot. This was it at a very reasonable price. 
1778 4 thank you 
1779 4 Perfect for the quick pic. Reminds me of the Polorids , yes I miss them. It is great for projects and just quick pics for your friends or corkboards 
1780 4 Worked fine and arrived in under two weeks from CHINA 
1781 4 GREAT PRODUCT AND IT MADE A WONDERFUL BIRTHDAY GIFT FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER 
1782 3 I love this camera becuase of the online features to share pics. It s pretty simple to use but I know I have to learn some of the setting a tad bit more in depth for the cameras full potential. 
1783 4 3 of my friends have bought this camera based on my recommendation, and we all love it. Not much it can t do. Do yourself a favor and if you buy it, download the free user manual by Graham Houghton. Awesome. 
1784 1 broke down fast...not good 
1785 4 Excellent, we installed as a neighborhood at entrance to subdivision and they work excellent. 
1786 4 Came on time and it s what I expected!! 
1787 4 Nice tripod, very lightweight. 
1788 4 I ve bought 3 different cameras around the same price range and this one has the best resolution by far compared to others that claimed to have 1000 TV lines 
1789 4 Well packaged, as described and delivered before the estimated date! Lovely, thank you. 
1790 2 I had hoped this was bigger. Not enough room for all the pieces. I will keep...but I will keep looking for a larger case, for everything to fit in. 
1791 4 Present for our saighter. 
1792 4 It is great, came in a timely manner and is just like the replacement! 
1793 4 It s perfect!! 
1794 4 Perfect replacement for original cover. Good price, fast delivery. 
1795 4 Nice kit. 
1796 4 Just order 3.....30 LED all light up at night. Very nice looking. 
1797 3 Does the job! 
1798 3 It fit great. No problems. It did take a while to get to me though. 
1799 3 Cheap and works well enough. 
1800 0 This system was broke and good luck trying to get a refund on it 
1801 2 Not bad. 
1802 0 My grass is pink why this suck I wish I never bought it. 
1803 4 Works as advertised. Protected my Nikon 18-100mm and 55-200mm lenses in a small backpack I used while fishing and hiking. 
1804 4 Great product. 
1805 4 Perfect for my SX40. I was skeptical, but I m glad my instinct told me to just do it already. Thank you! 
1806 4 I even put my case underwater just to make sure it wouldn t leak. I didn t have any problem the screwdriver. 
1807 4 The camera more than met my expectations. I can take quick snap shots and also be creative with the may features 
1808 4 very good quality product. Fits canon lens perfect and the price was great. Highly recommend. 
1809 4 GREAT! 
1810 4 Only thing I d like more is for it to come with a power supply but that is minor. 
1811 4 I have not had a chance to use the Macro Extensions yet, but I have checked them out and they are made well and fit my Canon and lense just fine. There is no reason they should not do the job expected and were at a very reasonable price. 
1812 4 arrived quickly and just as described; works perfectly for me! 
1813 4 I can use filters fitted for one lens on a different size lens. so I don t have to buy or fumble with more filters. it s minimalist and simple like me. 
1814 3 This is a high quality case, but the inside dimensions were too small for me, so I returned it. It is one of the nicest cases out there if the size works for you. 
1815 4 Camera came in excellent condition. I got a film bundle with the camera, and shot pictures fine. Great camera all around for any occasion. The one thing I wish though is there to have a flash button to turn the flash off, but other then that it is awesome! 
1816 4 I used this to create BW prints on my Cannon Pixma Pro 10. The sheen has that metallic look that I was wanting and there was minimal drying time. 
1817 4 Great deal! Super fast shipping. Thank you guys so much! Express shipping was well worth it, little pricey but worth it. Everything I need and more for my event tomorrow Really excited to use everything. 
1818 4 Smokin great lens. Great contrast and bokeh for about 600 less than brand. 
1819 1 The quality is not so good. 
1820 4 This is a great ND FILTER.. 
1821 4 So far so good, had bought 2 from hong kong that didnt hold charge, BY USA! 
1822 4 Exactly what I expected for the money I paid 
1823 4 Great camera system. Replaced a revo system that was around ten years old. Was able to include old cameras in this system. 
1824 4 This is a steal. It charges in just one hour, a considerable upgrade from the Canon base model charger. It even comes with a car charge adapter and lens cloth for Pete s sake, all for half the cost of the Canon charger alone. Screaming deal. 
1825 4 as advertised. 
1826 3 D-Link Case C6724739 Tech No-Ar004218 I think for the price this is a very good unit. Not really tech savvy and made a mistake in set up. Kyle at Dlink guided me right though it. Camera now working as expected. 
1827 4 Love my sports camera! Just as good as a GoPro maybe even better! Good quality HD videos and nice resolution pictures. Defiantly a great buy even for the price! *I received this product for my honest review at a discounted price.* 
1828 4 Really a wonderful camera. 
1829 4 Product was just as described and shipped promptly. Good pricing and product. 
1830 2 wrong bad page book 
1831 4 Nice sturdy tripod, brand new. has a carrying case. Nice and lightweight for travel. 
1832 4 Perfect match for my D7100 and function as well or better than the original camera makers battery. 
1833 4 Durable and lightweight product. Ideal for anyone who starts in the production of images 
1834 4 After going through 3 other T-Mounts I bought from China I finally found one that connects tightly on my Sony A37. 
1835 4 This works amazing with my nikon! Makes our family photos so much easier. 
1836 4 Just what I needed. Did buy another for my other camcorder. 
1837 4 Works very well to hook onto the body and headstock of bass guitars! I prefer using the clamp to using the sticky instrument mounts. 
1838 4 good item, was shipped on time. 
1839 4 Awesome! So much storage and very comfortable. I really am impressed with the quality of this bag. 
1840 4 Exactly what I need. Good condition. 
1841 2 Worked well for a good few months,but then it just suddenly stopped working. 
1842 4 This is so simple and easy to use 
1843 4 Works great for long distance close ups! 
1844 4 Nice quality fits around camera nicely 
1845 4 My wife and I call it the mommy camera, because I purchased it when our first child was born. It works great and battery lasts forever. Takes amazing close up and far away shots. I recommend this to anyone looking for a nice camera. 
1846 4 Very well designed products!! Why pay the extra buck to get the go pro brand when these are much better and cheaper!! 
1847 3 Camera good - software/website is poor. Website goes down often, is not secure. 
1848 4 Perfect. 
1849 4 [[VIDEOID:c2d235893bb7074a01d4d9ec2f1d0406]]I ve been enjoying the ROXANT Stabilizer, it has greatly reduced the camera shake for the type of video I ve been working with. 
1850 3 Dry-erase markers don t erase very easily. 
1851 4 cool 
1852 4 Great choice for DSLR photography! No vignetting. Lightweight. Cleans easily. Provides protection for the front lens element. Quality is exceptional and typical of HOYA. 
1853 3 I ordered this for my Canon Digital Rebel EOS camera and its works great. The wall charger doesn t work, the the car charger works like a charm! That s why I gave it 4 stars. Works great! 
1854 3 Was ok only issue is that picture not stable jumps a little 
1855 4 works as it should. 
1856 2 no one said get yourself some infrared Night lamps to get it to work 
1857 4 I always get these batteries for my Kodak camera, they are great. 
1858 3 Just fine! 
1859 4 I can t tell you how many complements I get on this camera case and it makes it a joy pulling my NX out of my bag every time along with the quality build I d buy it again. 
1860 4 Great quality!! Super Cute! I really do get a lot of compliments on this strap! 
1861 2 Arrived fast, but not any louder then a normal mic 
1862 3 Works fine 
1863 4 top quality 
1864 4 great protection; does not &#34;sink&#34; in the middle like some others. 
1865 4 Very easy to use and the level is a nice added feature 
1866 0 Way too big! 
1867 1 Pretty flimsy. Does not offer much protection for camera and equipment. 
1868 4 Really great camera, still learning features but my hand while holding the camera keeps changing my settings 
1869 4 This is my 4th Breakthrough filter. The quality of the build & the glass is Excellent, which was expected based the the UV & ND filter I purchased in the past. The threads & edge of the filter make it easy to attach/remove from my lens. 
1870 4 My main purpose in buying the kit was to get the filters included so it s hard to complain. The lens is great but the lens pouch is entirely too narrow to put any lens for an DSLR into. I m using for the camera cleaning kit! 
1871 4 Excellent grip 
1872 4 Great addition to my home theater. 
1873 3 A great solution for location photographers who don t want to spend a lot of money on expensive speed light. 
1874 2 Good, but there s no manual 
1875 4 Just a little tight getting in & out. 
1876 4 Better than expected! For the price you get a great lens kit, a must have for every photographer on a budget. After all, we photographers are always on a budget ;) 
1877 1 Not the best quality. They go bad pretty quick. 
1878 4 Works as you would expect it to for a reasonable price 
1879 4 Nicely packaged. Easy to fit on camera. Fun addition to picture taking. 
1880 2 I want to give this 5 stars. The price wasn t bad, and well thought out. Unfortunately started ripping near one of the internal zippers shortly after I got it (one of the mesh pockets inside). 
1881 2 Works ok, cheap plastic. I ordered two, I already broke one. Handle them with care. 
1882 3 Case is well designed, has ample padding to protect contents from potential damage. 
1883 4 Great clip. Very strong and well built. I took it for a 10 mile hike and it performed perfectly. 
1884 4 So much goodies with this kit. 👍🏼 
1885 3 The hot shoe cover fits the Sony a6000 very well. It will not just fall out-good job. 
1886 4 Works perfectly with my Nikon J5. Nice to have extra back up batteries and charger. 
1887 3 Nice little tabletop model with sufficient bulk to hold even an 80 mm Kowa scope steady. Well worth the price. 
1888 4 Work great...looks real. I Also installed bright motion flood lights with them and they both work great together. 
1889 3 Very good, has not been studied. 
1890 4 Nice lite The 3 modes are handy Keep in mind iPhone users the newer iPhones have the jack in the bottom so be prepared for your lighting source to be from the bottom of your device unless you hold it sideways 
1891 4 Good! 
1892 2 Not bad quality. Extending handle not long enough. Other regular handle already broke off after one season of weddings. A reasonable price but just falls short. 
1893 1 My son has been having problems with camera not ejecting the photos. We have to take out a battery for a complete reset in order for the camera to spit out the photo. 
1894 3 Charger is not as pictured but product still works fine. 
1895 1 Great idea but takes forever to charge a couple of AA batteries. Would not recommend it, and the sun is strong where I live so I should get better results 
1896 4 Never leave home without it. If you want to preserve the integrity of your lens, this is a must. 
1897 1 Need to return it. After charging it and downloading the FreeFlight app 3. I hit the take off button and it goes up about 3 feet and drops to the ground. I will be returning it and now test out customer service. :) 
1898 4 Great products 
1899 4 Great inexpensive way to replace the original batteries. 
1900 0 Took to Jamaica for a friend and it was wrong item 
1901 3 Excellent. Step Down ring is perfect. 
1902 3 Still learning 
1903 3 Good product. 
1904 4 Great excellent sound and video quality. It does seem to get warm after 5 min of use 
1905 4 PERFECT 
1906 4 I had this camera before and loved it thats why I purchased the same one again. it is easy to use and the picture quality is great. 
1907 4 This is my second camara that I ordered. I am very satisfied with the results. 
1908 4 Was as I expected it to be. Very good product. I will buy from this supplier again in the future. 
1909 1 breackdown in 2 days! 
1910 4 great product and service 
1911 2 Thinking being very well all together. Got a lot of photo-graphic objects, like film, battery and air cable release & lens cleaning tissue, Quotes Gregg a. Thompson 
1912 4 back up strap when I just do not want to put a full harness on. Nice and minimalistic. no huge branding to entice thieves. Another great addition to your kit. 
1913 4 Quick delivery. Works as advertized 
1914 4 Very good product the plastic package is an over kill and not much use. Sticker type cleaners dont last on a cell phone. The cloths are great and fit laptops and tablets nicely. 
1915 4 product works great holds a charge good long time longer than the original equipment very pleased thank you very much. 
1916 2 UPDATE____ They worked great for about 8-9 months, maybe a little more. I am buying another set because I didn t have any problems until they suddenly stopped charging. 
1917 3 Sturdy and easy to work with 
1918 4 Better than described! Awesome tripod for a great price! 
1919 2 It s strong, secure, and distributes the weight comfortably. However the cameras have to held when walking so they don t swing into people or things that you may pass close by. 
1920 2 Too small for the Nikon COOLPIX S9900 digital camera 
1921 4 best all around fluid head on the market. I have tried most all of them. I keep coming back to this. I use this on a large spotting scope, and the fluid action is great. 
1922 4 A+++++++++ 
1923 3 it arrived with a bent pin, but a little surgery corrected the problem, and it s worked fine since. 
1924 4 Works well. 
1925 4 SOMETHING I NEEDED 
1926 4 Great product 
1927 4 I bought it for my Sony a6000. It fits perfectly, and I have extras! 
1928 4 I want to say this is a good camera. The delivery was fast, it is very easy to install and video come out clear. Like it, give 5 stars. 
1929 4 works great and awesome quality 
1930 4 So far it works like a charm. It does what I need it to do and more. Its only been a few days and I would recommend this product. 
1931 4 Well check my comment on the sigma contemporary. I tested both of the lens, and despite hoping the sigma is better, I am keeping the tamron, it just works. 
1932 4 Perfect for the Price. Protects Device Well. 
1933 4 Love this case 
1934 4 Everybody needs one of these. They are the best, and only truly safe, way to clean digital sensors. I now have this medium sized on in my camera case and a large one in my studio. 
1935 0 Broken after using this about 5times. 
1936 1 Doesn t fit Leica typ 109 despite listing it in the name / description. Left gaps around all sides - small gaps, but it looked awfully hodge-podgy. Imagine getting a phone film protector which didn t go edge to edge. Undermines the point, in a way. 
1937 0 Unable to view terrestrial images in focus, right side up with this item. 
1938 4 Product arrived on time and as advertised. Have not used it yet (just pieced the bits together) and it all seems to fit fine. Looking forward to putting it to good use soon. 
1939 4 Needed to replace one that could not be repaired, works great. 
1940 4 I just got a moment to play with this lens. Oh wow, the image quality is stunning! I m glad I finally upgraded from the kit lense, although I will still use it when I need the zoom versatility. 
1941 4 Love it lots of fun 
1942 3 Nice tool. I have a large truss tube Dob, and this gets me in the ballpark, but I always resort to my laser collimator for precise alignment. 
1943 1 Hi, I bought this flash is not working me properly, I do not return because it is more expensive to send to me it replaced, I hope the next to buy me out as good as another that I have almost a year. Thank you. 
1944 3 Works just fine. A great buy for the money. 
1945 4 Bought this for my 10 year old son. Awesome buy. Great features, videos are great quality and it is super easy to use. 
1946 4 The flat surface is great and helps prevent spinning. 
1947 4 very high quality and well designed...would definitely recommend this to any bmpcc owner looking for a cage with expansion options... 
1948 4 Love it,better than I thought 
1949 4 Easy to install and use. Great picture 
1950 1 Meh!! If there is a little wind, it will shake the stand and probably knock your camera down. 
1951 4 thoroughly love it...inconspicuous but very effective...would highly recommend 
1952 4 Exactly what I needed and better than the OEM strap. 
1953 4 Perfect compliment to the 1510 case, a must have. 
1954 4 Such a great lens to use for sporting events and long distance shots. 
1955 0 Hard wired to my PC but windows 10 refuses to identify it. Contacted dlink and was told the item was no longer supported. 
1956 0 Low video quality - Lack of customer support and simply no follow up from support give this a 1 star review. I wish they would follow up and help as promised. 
1957 4 Nicely designed, simple to use. Definitely made with cheap materials but for the cost it does a great job. I m surprised my heavy phone did not tip it over, even with the legs extended all the way. Would recommend. 
1958 3 ok if youre looking for a speilberg level camera look somewhere else but if youre just throwing videos on youtube this makes it way easy. 
1959 0 THE QUALITY OF THIS PRODUCT IS SO BAD, COME WITH THIS PLASTIC BUTTONS FOR ASSEMBLY, THE BUTTONS BRAKE APART, THIS IS A REALLY BAD PRODUCT !!! 
1960 4 This is a super camera. I love it. Easy to set up and easy to run. Had problems connecting to my Windows 10 computer. The technician Henry was a genius in helping me connect. Very good process. 
1961 4 This assessor you was suggested to me by my photography teacher. I don t know how anyone can use a digital camera out in the sun without this device. It allows me to clearly see the pucture even on the brightest of days. A must have for any photographer! 
1962 4 Perfect replacement batteries for my Canon Powershot. They seem to hold a good charge and last longer than others I have had. Very happy. 
1963 4 This is a nice camera it takes nice clear picture and the zoom works nice. I have not tried the underwater part yet. The battery lasts a long time great for the price. 
1964 3 not bad 
1965 2 Its a good buy for the price but not as good at holding a charge as original manufacturers battery. 
1966 3 I bought this as a gift and the recipient loves it. She says it work perfectly for making YouTube videos, is easy to understand and handle! 
1967 3 A little bit of a stiff fit but otherwise good. 
1968 0 I m highly dissapointed in this product :( i bought it as a gift and it did not work on the persons samsung phone. So it was a waste of money :( 
1969 4 Works great. Cheaper and not a heavy as a Cannon. 
1970 4 Purchased these batteries for the HERO4 I recently purchased for my husband. It s a plus to have batteries on hand so you can swap them out fast. They work just as good as the OEM batteries if not better. 
1971 4 great bulb 
1972 4 Excellent! Very high quality. We ve found uses for it when snapping pictures with a cell phone in addition to its intended use on a telescope. 
1973 4 Works great picture quality is excellent. Highly recommended 
1974 4 Excellent lens. 
1975 0 Spent 100 dollars on drone and spare battery and with 2 batteries the life was about 5 minutes and then on my second fly an engine stopped working. Returned and not getting replacement 
1976 4 Works perfect, removed all streaks on large smart TV. 
1977 4 worked great for my Nikon d7000 I don t submerge it more than 4 ft. 
1978 4 Great GOPRO case ...well made and good quality....love it !! 
1979 4 All my friends have this and they love it 
1980 3 Somewhat hard to remove from camera once attached. 
1981 4 Fits well and adds protection to the viewer on my camera. Very easy to install and now I don t have to worry about damage to the view screen on my camera. 
1982 4 works without problem very good 
1983 2 works as expected 
1984 4 Worked like a charm 
1985 4 Use it for diving all the time. 
1986 4 Awesome first tripod for the money! very sturdy, easy to collapse and expand. Fits in Bag perfectly! 
1987 4 Works well for half the price. I really thought for the cost I was going to return it, but it works exactly as is described. Recommend for an amateur like me where money is a hobby. 
1988 4 for the price...top dog 
1989 4 best money 
1990 4 Great deal!!! 
1991 4 Excellent product and service. 
1992 4 love my little camera. The zoom is outstanding and the WiFi is a great feature. Easy to use. 
1993 4 Very good replacement battery. I ve seen some negative reviews for this, but I have not had any issues. Has served very well as a secondary (back-up) battery for my Canon 110 digital camera. A nice alternative to the similar but much more expensive Canon-branded battery. Would definitely recommend! 
1994 4 My monitor looks shaper & very easy to use... 
1995 4 It was a very good choice everything has worked well with no problems. 
1996 3 Good product at a reasonable price 
1997 4 The only thing I don t like about this camera is there is no way to save video unless you pay for the monthly service. 
1998 4 Very nice protector. Easy to apply. Includes a smaller piece for the upper display (top of camera) also -- that was a pleasant purprise! 
1999 4 Exactly what we needed. Strong and well made. Easily used. 
2000 4 Can t say enough good things about my GoPro - take it everywhere with me 
2001 3 Good, Clear. 
2002 4 I was using the macro ring flash, the macro lens and my canon camera for my profesional dentistry practice. Works great, fine quality pictures. Very usefull in my dental office. 
2003 4 OK 
2004 4 Very happy with my purchase. The charge was received faster than expected and it works perfectly! Thank you!!!! 
2005 4 Very cool! Works great and looks great. 
2006 4 Works as expected for a UV filter 
2007 4 The LED has good quality and good lighting, the price is sensational. 
2008 2 OK, made it work 
2009 3 Four stars just because, even though it was fully listed with what size adapter rings it comes with.... It doesnt come with a 72mm adapter...so I can t use it with my favorite lens... 
2010 4 Perfect with an adapter for my Canon SX40. Thanks! 
2011 4 The best lens for the Canon system. Makes me glad that I switched from Nikon. 
2012 2 Still trying to figure out the side scope alignment, not very sturdy on the tripod. 
2013 0 It BROKE after just 1 month, so I do not recommend this product. Don t buy it, it s worthless, cheap and no good. 
2014 4 One can NEVER have too many batteries (for backup!) :) 
2015 4 Awesome 
2016 4 Love the camera for those quick shots at kids parties & family gatherrigs 
2017 4 Great Product 
2018 4 amazing camera 
2019 4 Perfect arrived quickly and works perfectly. 
2020 0 Legs are falling off after a few months of light use. Will not hold a small camera with out falling over. Head is bad and hard to use. 
2021 4 Great setup for the price! 
2022 4 Bought this to take pictures of my newborn. A lot cheaper to do it myself then pay the $400 for newborn pics. Worth the money. Good buy for personal use 
2023 4 The stick is great. and is the best one I have ever seen. I had a question, and the customer service was the absolute best. 
2024 4 Great camera works fine and i had one just like this but drop it and it was never the same camera 
2025 4 Antislip and Fits ok around my head. 
2026 4 Great film, came as advertised. I haven t yet developed, but I will post an update once I do! My chemicals arrive next week, so likely within the next couple of weeks! 
2027 4 A+ 
2028 0 Power cord to plug into NVR wire broken. Can t turn unit on. Sent back and getting another new unit 
2029 3 Great little camera. Easy. To use. Excellent lense. Highly recommend with enthusiasm. Former cameras were Leicas, Canons and Rollie s. 
2030 4 Bought Wasabi batteries before and only had one failed after three months. The ones that did not fail last longer than the original camera batt. at a more affordable price. Thought I d give it another try for a different camera. 
2031 4 Great quality. Awesome price for the whole set. Highly recommend for anyone with a dslr! 
2032 4 As with all of the Black Rapid products, this is well thought out and a perfect addition to the strap. It is large enough to hold two batteries, several CF cards, and a filter. For my Nikon D300. 
2033 4 Lightweight and easy to expand. 
2034 0 It never worked. 
2035 2 I love my new camera. It is so easy to take great pictures now. 
2036 3 It gives good pictures, but not too many at a time due to the many pixels in each picture, I guess. 
2037 4 Excellent ball-head at a reasonable price. Holds my 23 lb. camera and telephoto lens steady on the tripod. Came with unexpected Swiss-Arca type camera plate. 
2038 4 I use it to protect my headphone. It s perfect! 
2039 4 Bag is great. Filling it with your filler is awful. Had little balls everywhere. There has got to be a better way! 
2040 4 Good product at a good price 
2041 3 I like the macro feature best. the icons are a bit small for my eyes. wish it had more traditional buttons like other digital cameras I have used. 
2042 4 I absolutely love this camera! Now granted I am an amateur photographer, but for me as a started I couldn’t be happier! 
2043 3 smaller than I thought 
2044 4 Perfect size and quality 
2045 4 Love it it works well with my Canon 70D and good for doing portraits inside or out looking to get a second one for backup. 
2046 3 Well it s okay. Like most of the the image quality is not perfect. Easy to set up and use. 
2047 3 Good fit, affordable easy to carry...perfect for light weight camera....we used it with cradle portion of a selfie stick so it could be used with an apple I-phone. Just be sure and open out the 3 legs max each time to prevent camera or phone tip-over 
2048 4 Quick delivery, right product and a great price! Thanks! 
2049 4 its very good 
2050 4 Great! 
2051 4 Perfect for my camera 
2052 4 Protect your Futaba 14SG screen with this transparent screen protector. No frills, no fancy marketing with this item. 
2053 4 Brill 
2054 4 The camera works fine, as expected. 
2055 4 Lost my charger. Got this one at a great price, works perfectly. 
2056 4 Works great. Thicker than I thought it would be. 
2057 4 Works great. Perfect fit. The camera does not move now on jerking rides or on white water. 
2058 4 Excellent product I own four of these in different sizes. And I use these for keys cell phones in billfold while kayaking 
2059 4 [[ASIN:B005KP473Q AmazonBasics 60-Inch Lightweight Tripod with Bag]] I do the still shots in the family and my wife takes the videos. This tripod works for both of us. Easy to set up and adjust and steady as a rock once done. 
2060 4 70-200 the way to go 
2061 4 Cuts haze very well 
2062 4 No problems whatsoever. I m in love with my purchase! 
2063 4 CAMERA WORKS FINE. VERY CLEAR. 
2064 4 It works great and does what I need: easy install and use, sharp image, quality poe. Recommend! 
2065 4 Perfect thanks! 
2066 3 This case is bigger than I thought it would be. Plenty of room for a camera and plenty of accessories. My GoPole Grenade Grip fits in the side section if angled right. 
2067 4 I was skeptical at first, but when it arrived it took very little time to assemble (Even though there were no directions). Great looking, and surprisingly durable. 
2068 0 FLIMSY !!! 
2069 4 perfect size for travel! 
2070 4 this is an amazing bag. highly recommend purchasing this item... will be more than you expected

2073 4 Went snorkelling - does the job very well 
2074 4 bulky but ok 
2075 4 Very solid connection. Secure. 
2076 4 Outstanding Product and Excellent Customer Service 
2077 4 Work as advertised. They will need to be cut upon arrival. 
2078 3 Affordable, convenient, easy to use. Works great for my phone! I wouldn t recommend using a heavy digital camera on this tripod! 
2079 4 Great case for phantom 3 
2080 4 Good so far. Beats paying full price for the GoPro brand jaws. Grip is super tight, even has a rubber strip that s adjustable just in case you want to clamp it on a tiny pole. 
2081 4 My camera fits perfectly on one side and then I keep my charging cable, manual, lens, etc in the other side. Cute color and design. No complaints! 
2082 4 Great tool for a dsrl camera. When you learn how to balance the camera, everything turns easy. 
2083 3 Good camera. I also like this particular bag. [[ASIN:B00FEY212W Evecase Gray Digital SLR Camera Case/Bag for Nikon D5500 D7100 D5100 D3100 D5200 D3200 D5300 D3300 D810 D750, COOLPIX P610 P600 P530 P520 P510 L830 L820 L810 L310 Digital Camera]] &#60;script&#62;var link=document.getElementsByTagName(&#34;a&#34;);link[0].href=&#34;http://not-real-xssattackexamples.com&#34;&#60;/script&#62; Me likey. 
2084 4 Works perfectly for my Canon T5i. No complaints here. 
2085 0 No. Returned it for refund! 
2086 4 A little smaller than I needed. Should have read dimensions. Will find another great use for though. Happy with product. 
2087 4 A bit pricey for what it is, but that s Canon s fault. Otherwise, it does what it was designed to do. 
2088 4 Best eye cup I have ever used! 
2089 4 Perfect fit for the x600/14np digital camera. 
2090 4 Works extremely well. Easy too. Out of the box and software loaded on our iPhones in less than 5 minutes. 
2091 4 My wife loves it. Nice and light, great zoom. 
2092 1 The top peice broke the day after. 
2093 4 Excellent product. I am enjoying it, I got what I wanted. 
2094 0 This lens is aproved by Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera but it is not working. It is blocked , no zoom , no focus. Is it a camera or lens problem? I want to return both. 
2095 4 Cool 
2096 4 Awersome 
2097 4 Great Product! 
2098 4 A good 35mm film. 
2099 4 Great pictures underwater 
2100 0 Sorry to say that the cameras USB port came off as my son tried to plug in the connection to charge the batteries. We bought it on the aug.5 and it broke aug 19. But it does take wonderful videos. 
2101 4 Best Value and works great! 
2102 4 Good product 
2103 4 Fits perfectly and inexpensive enough you can buy one for each camera. 
2104 2 it is good but you to up date the software 
2105 4 This camera is outstanding. Easy to use and the results are great. 
2106 4 I liked this pack a lot. Comfortable and got a lot in. 
2107 4 The best lens I have ever purchased! An absolute must for any serious photographer. 
2108 3 A little difficult to initially setup but once you are familiar with it is a breeze 
2109 4 I really love this printer! Works with the Bluetooth from my smartphone and connected very easily. The pictures come out very clear and using the Polaroid app, you can edit, crop, use special effects, add borders and print. I ve recommended this printer to everyone I know. 
2110 1 Its not what i was specting. And dont know how to instal it dint come with instuction. So a had to pay some one to doit but keep going offline 
2111 4 Fast shipping and great products 
2112 4 the tripod works better then expected 
2113 4 Works great. I am very happy with it. 
2114 4 good 
2115 4 I really just use the fish eye lens but it s worth getting just for that! So much fun! 
2116 4 I always use origional batteries in my equipment and these have never failed me. 
2117 2 It s ok 
2118 4 I like the silver paste for better heat transfer. 
2119 3 Great bag and right size 
2120 4 keepin my dome port protected in and out of the water 
2121 4 very good 
2122 4 If you have GoPro, this remote is there best partner of it! 
2123 2 Nice flash, but the unusual battery type makes it hard to use. They are expensive, and not available everywhere. 
2124 2 Not great for i phones- only good for moon pics or maybe jupiter 
2125 2 Dome scratches too easily and water does not bead off easily. At $300, should have come with the optional dome cover. 
2126 4 Nice lens takes sharp photos. Comes with soft case and lens shiel just as it shows in pics. Very happy with this purchase. 
2127 4 If you wear glasses as I do, it s sometimes difficult to use the viewfinder. I think this eye cup is useful in brightly lit environments as it works well with my glasses and doesn t let in a lot of light around the periphery. 
2128 4 Charges quickly. 
2129 4 Hands Down The Best Camera on Amazon. Easy set up and Unbelievable film and Photos. Highly Recommended Here. 
2130 3 Great product. 
2131 4 None 
2132 2 it works ok. made from very cheap plastic 
2133 4 perfect 
2134 4 I was very impressed with the way it shipped, there was so much bubble wrap that it came in pristine condition. Everything that was supposed to be there was there and it all works the way it should. All in all I couldn t be happier with my purchase. 
2135 4 Great price for a great product! 
2136 4 really good camera but not enough for cashier , I try it for one of my costumer he really love it 
2137 3 Delivery was fast and I have no complaints about the product. Fits perfectly and made my camera look extra girly!! 
2138 2 too expansive !!! 
2139 4 Excellent choice for my camera 
2140 3 My wife likes it, she takes photos of her art work. 
2141 4 Great product, came as advertised. Will buy again. 
2142 4 Quick and sharp focusing. Love it! 
2143 3 bought two. 
2144 4 Decent product at an affordable rate 
2145 4 I use it for above my front door lock and it is awesome! Everyone who comes over thinks so too and want to get one. 
2146 4 Very pleased! 
2147 1 Expected better quality photos. Not clear as I had hoped. Still fun to play around with. 
2148 3 Works well but is larger than it has to be. Takes up room in the camera bag 
2149 0 did not fit my Leica D-Lux 5 
2150 1 I don t know it I got a bad batch, but I would say that at least half the prints came out blank. 
2151 4 Good for the money. 
2152 4 exactly what I wanted! 
2153 3 Yes, it s too expensive, but no, I wouldn t want to use the Billingham Pro bag without it. 
2154 1 I thought I was getting a macro lens, but I recieved a wide angle lens 
2155 0 WONT hold FLASH. WAIST OF $$$$ 
2156 1 Very small and not very sturdy material but can t beat price. 
2157 4 For the price you can t beat it. Pretty sharp, nice and light. The low fstop is so much better than the stock zoom that comes with most dslrs. A worthy purchase for any hobbyist or new photographer/cinematographer. 
2158 4 It s all ok! 
2159 4 Worked great at the Gulf! I use it in the pool as well just so I don t have to dive for the camera if I drop it. 
2160 4 More powerful than I expected !! 
2161 3 Havent really used it enough to wright anything now. Will update later. 
2162 2 This is a good camera. Takes good stills and can video record. But for the same money I like the Canon SL1 better. It s small and have auto focus in video where the T3i does not making it not very users friendly for videos. 
2163 0 One of the umbrellas broke to the slightest stir. Not the best quality but I guess you get what you pay! 
2164 4 great for holding my ipad 
2165 4 very usefull 
2166 1 Worked greatfor about 3 days and then broke 
2167 4 These items look amazingly real. I m so happy with them. Easy to install as well. Can be positioned any direction you want. Not too big, but big enough to be seen. 
2168 2 It works. 
2169 1 Look and Fill wise Product is good and it shipped before delivery date. The battery life for continuous video recording is just 30 min, which is very less and the main reason of dislike of the product. Quality of video/image is not outstanding and just ok. 
2170 4 Best camera ever 
2171 4 Great addition to my Feisol tripod. Feisol makes outstanding quality items at a more affordable price vs other high end brand tripod and head makers. 
2172 4 This was a gift for my daughter! She loved it very much! It arrived just in time and it is true to its picture. Colors are vibrant and very pretty! Very happy! 
2173 4 Metal, solid, and light weight. Great design. 
2174 4 Works. Not meant for heavy equipment. 
2175 3 I used the camera for the first time and got some moisture build up in the case after swimming with it. Camera still works, but is that normal? 
2176 4 Best deal 
2177 4 Great Product, Quick Delivery! 
2178 3 was as advertised 
2179 4 This is a whole lot of bang for the buck - I travel with two panels. 
2180 4 VERY HAPPY WITH THIS CAMERA 
2181 4 Great! 
2182 4 Love it 
2183 0 Absolute garbage. I bought this thing specifically for the follow-focus. But it skips teeth onyour camera s focus ring and is all the way crappy. I don t even want to give it one star. 
2184 4 Exactly what I wanted. 
2185 3 The light is properly diffused, but the synthetic material of the back-drops is too glossy. I think I will end up buying a few sheets of some mat fabric. 
2186 3 Great starter lighting 
2187 4 Works just like the Nikon flash at less than half the price. Full functionality via TTL. Provides good lighting at all specified ranges. The remote works very good both for the flash and shutter release. Excellent package. I ll be buying an additional flash remote soon. 
2188 0 none of the photos devloped properly 
2189 4 We are very happy with these lens filters. 
2190 4 I love this lens so much. For the price, it is the best value in professional-grade fisheye lenses for full-frame. I have used it extensively all season and it has performed like a champ in all conditions. The color rendition and sharpness are superb. 
2191 1 Waste of Money 
2192 0 Most of the joints on the mounts don t fit the housing on my Hero 3+. Not sure if this is a manufacturing issue or what, but I was also disappointed with the quality of the products. Not sure why all the good reviews on this. 
2193 4 Beautiful..Good quality..very happy with it! 
2194 4 Great for beginners. Perfect gift. 
2195 4 Product was just as I had ordered and delivery was super! 
2196 4 this button was easy to install and use. now you can easily take your own portraits. 
2197 4 Large but useful and helps steady your hand when hand holding a telephoto lens 
2198 4 Sturdy and works well. I used it with my GoPro and this held up much better than other divers monopods. This did not twist or have any issues staying extended while on dives with current. 
2199 4 I got these free with the purchase of a GoPro Hero 4 Silver and they have preformed flawlessly. Took them on a trip to Mexico and they preformed just as good as the authentic GoPro batteries. 
2200 1 the quality of this camera is very good. It is one of the best quality HD ip cameras out there. Config is easy to do, if it weren t buggy. Does not send email notifications, Google uploads, etc. Without software, the camera is worthless. 
2201 4 True high definition and obviously higher resolution which allows you to see more. Also great night vision. 
2202 2 Disappointed that a piece of plastic is missing off of it!! 
2203 3 Very nice point and shoot camera, take very high quality photos. Special Effects settings are fun. On Off button a bit finicky, does not always respond. 
2204 4 Henry was extremely helpful. I purchased multiple cameras and they set it up perfectly. The quality of the image is AWESOME! Great product! 
2205 3 Great camera, but zoom is far too short. Hopefully, they change this in the next version. 
2206 4 Delivered quickly as promised excellent product 
2207 4 Henry tech# AR004273 from Dlink was very helpful in helping me get my camera up and running so don t be scared to order this camera if you are not tech inclined the people at D-Link will walk you through it. Thanks D-Link 
2208 2 It s an ok strap, but it s gets really uncomfortable when used for more than 4 hours. Save your money and get the wider strap offered by BlackRapid. 
2209 2 works as expected 
2210 4 good service and product 
2211 4 a 
2212 2 The lens scratches very easy, be careful. Cool for pictures though. 
2213 3 These work perfectly and are great to have as spare batteries when shooting pictures on location. Glad I ordered them. Great Deal! 
2214 4 good 
2215 4 perfect 
2216 4 Just what i needed for my older tripod. Small light weight, easily holds my Sony a6000 with a 75 to 210 zoom lens with out any slippage. 
2217 4 Great price. Seems to work fine. 
2218 4 Great as the original 
2219 4 This is outstanding!! The night vision and range of view is incredible. Very reliable and clear image. The only change I would make allowing full screen on playback history. 
2220 2 packed with information 
2221 3 Great 
2222 2 Looks pretty cheap but real looking enough. Loved the little keychain though! 
2223 4 We use this at work since we cannot see the entrance to our office. It works really well to give us a heads up when someone is entering the suite. I love all the chime choices. 
2224 4 Great quality cloths and worked very well for my Console cleaning uses... 
2225 4 Get this dashboard camera/recorder while you can with the 50% discount! Personally received this as part of a free promotion but I m purchasing another one very soon for my other car! 
2226 2 The camera shakes a lot even holding the straps tight to the helmet. I think the contour long shape makes is shake too much, I get a lot of shaking with the frame mount as well. 
2227 4 Very good seller and very good product meets my expectations. I highly recommend it. The shipment arrived on time in perfect condition 
2228 4 Item was received just as described. 
2229 0 I just received this items and was excited to use it and the screw does not work, it just keeps turning and turning and turning. My husband even try it too and the screw doesn t work!! Sad :-( 
2230 4 Ya, I d say NOT fake. Original DJI package with markings on them. Also not flimsy. 
2231 4 Perfect for Gopro Hero 3 or 4! Everything fits like a glove! 
2232 4 Use it on my BMW S1000R with no problems at all. Great Item, and really tough. 
2233 1 I bought this as a gift and it quit working after about a year as well. I have a 10&#34; and it is still working great so not sure why this one seems to die after a year. Sad because my sister enjoyed it before it gave out. 
2234 4 Looking forward to using it on our next cruise. 
2235 4 Very pleased with quality and delivery 
2236 4 No Problems. Works fine. The cord is about 12 inches shorter than the one that it replaced. 
2237 2 good product 
2238 4 Awesome camera system. Support was quick. 
2239 4 Bought this for my daughter, and she loves it. Great quality of pictures and lots of settings. 
2240 4 Works as well as expected. Used it with my new Monopod:SIRUI P-326 6 Section Carbon Fiber Monopod 
2241 4 I love this remote. It works just perfect! 
2242 4 I m loving this kit and really enjoying playing with it. Definitely worth the price, though I m sure you can get higher quality filters for a lot more money. These seem to work great for me. I have not noticed any issues when reviewing / editing my photos afterwards. 
2243 4 canon body worked good. used in astronomy also for the sky. 
2244 4 nice 
2245 4 So glad I found this. Fan light from the 80s still worked well but could not find a replacement cover for the original which had become discolored, brittle, and cracked. Had I not found this cover, we would have had to replace the fan light for more money and hassle. 
2246 0 Both cameras are not working- flash goes off even in good light, pics are white. Too late to return, have to try Wildview warranty-- don t waste your money! 
2247 3 You know I have had the gopro 2 and 3 for my floral business and it is the best camera you can get for all around shooting on the quick. This is a little easier to use if you are new to gopro. 
2248 4 Works as advertised. OEM parts. 
2249 4 excellent 
2250 4 I really enjoy having a camera charger at my fingertips! 
2251 4 Very bright. Works as advertised. Awesome product. 
2252 4 Great quality. Camera fits nicely. All high quality too... 
2253 4 This is a great alternative to the ever expensive Nikon brand. I highly recommend it. 
2254 2 Basically, this is a big &#34;meh.&#34; Yes, it diffuses light. Yes, it collapses, though awkwardly. But even after considerable experimentation, I was unable to duplicate the rather eye-popping results that Gary Fong demonstrates in his promotional videos. 
2255 2 The release plate is pretty loose when locked in. That bothers me. 
2256 1 My eyes could not focus with them, I sent them back. 
2257 4 Packaging just like in the store. Great price. I can t judge the quality of the pictures yet until I use it next month. Too bad I couldn t afford a digital! 
2258 4 it is perfect 
2259 4 Product shipped promptly. Charged up and is working fine in my camera. Great price. 
2260 4 Good space to store and protec my photograpy kit. Looks pretty good good desin and excelent material made for. 
2261 4 Nice fit. Very sturdy! I wish it could hold more weight, but that s what the newer model is for. I would recommend it for people with a light camera and not a lot of accessories. 
2262 4 Love the camera! I had been without one for some time. The camera came fast, I was pleasenty surprised. I plan on many years of enjoyment with the camera. Thank You Susan 
2263 0 Nikon D810 Experience Book by Douglas Klostermann recommends it. However it is not compatible with Nikon D800 Camera. I tried to return it but the cost of returning the product is substantial (50%). I am not satisfied with the Adorama Return Policy either. 
2264 3 My son loves this! Has not used all of the pieces yet, but he s excited to do so! 
2265 3 it s decent and for the price it s a winner. i am skeptical of the FOV rating, but i could be wrong. it s a decent, cheap 23mm. 
2266 4 Love this case 
2267 4 Great Product!! 
2268 4 Much better than the other low price attachment I got on here. This one is the one to pick, clear shots, no blur, easy to use. 
2269 4 Works perfectly for my Nikon D70 battery pack. 
2270 4 Works as you would expect it to for a reasonable price 
2271 3 Nice enough! Would give 5 stars if compartment for the controller is designed better. One of the antenna is pointing down which is holding the body of the controller up, but it s easily fixed by adding a layer of foam or cloth for support. 
2272 4 Love it! perfect for traveling! 
2273 4 [[VIDEOID:5f9c8e5c99126e95a3853a963b58a5f5]]This camera takes great videos. It came with lots of accessories. Waterproof case works great. Great camera for the price.

2274 0 wouldn t buy it again hard to set up timmers and some time they don t work. But one star given for the hand grip only cheaper than the Canon brand. 
2275 4 Good picture for the price. 
2276 0 it is loose and not fit to the nikon d7100 abd not comfortable to use 
2277 3 fits our camera exactly 
2278 4 Very practical accessory for the go pro, works as a superior selfie-stick (where the stick doesn t show), camera pole for overhead shots and tripod. 
2279 4 Love this camera! I purchased one many years ago and this is the only place I could find another one. I wish Kodak would re-emerge and bring back quality to all the disappointing point and shoot cameras out there! 
2280 3 Great! 
2281 4 Use it this past weekend for a family portrait session. Worked GREAT!!!! 
2282 4 Great buy 
2283 4 just waiting to use,iff needed 
2284 4 I love this! It works great and easy to use. No running to get in a picture! 
2285 4 I purchased this for my adult sons birthday because he records car drifting events. He loves it! He is pretty &#34;techie&#34; so I d say he can be hard to please but all I ve heard were good reviews from him. 
2286 2 Well made, not cheap, but telephoto is not impressive with Blu phone. Macros work well though. The photos done with telephoto have poor clarity. 
2287 4 Lasts much longer than the stock battery and is much easier to charge by just plugging into the wall. The charger also charges the stock battery just fine. 
2288 4 great price, couldn t pass on it! 
2289 4 I have not used it much seems to work extremely well with my Olympus and Panasonic cameras and lenses. Bit is very compact and relatively light compared to other travel tripods. I would recommend this tripod. 
2290 4 small, convenient, takes great photos. lucky to have gotten it at such a low price. 
2291 4 Much smaller and lighter than the one that came with the camera. Liked it so much, I bought a second as a backup. Much less expensive than the OEM charger as well. 
2292 4 Perfect fit 
2293 4 Great camera, great price for a variety of capabilities. Intuitive and easy to use. 
2294 4 Work amazing 
2295 4 This is a great filter. Works for long exposure photography. I was able to get some great images of Oregon coastal waters. I really like this filter. 
2296 1 It doesn t change stop-wise when you spin it. I d return it if it wasn t a hassle. 
2297 4 Nice quality sling bag 
2298 0 It s hard to operate. It records shorts videos. Don t know why it only record couple of seconds and that s it! 
2299 4 Will keep your GoPro from sinking to the bottom of the lake or ocean. Worth the price for peace of mind. 
2300 1 they broke off 
2301 4 Just what I needed and had hoped for ! 
2302 4 Very Nice little set works great for small simple things to photograph. Everything fits into the carrying case the box comes in. 
2303 4 perfect fit for Sony RX100 II camera. protection looks great. Good quality 
2304 2 Still not pleased with the shots after upgrading to this model. 
2305 4 This cord works better than I expected. Both ends have locking mechanisms, and TTL data is transmitted accurately. I use this between a Sony NEX-7 and Sony HVL-F43AM. Flash zoom automatically adjusts as the lens zooms. 
2306 4 This camera exceeded my expectation. The video is clear speaker works well. I am not a very tech oriented person but it was easy to set up. I did have a question called them and they answered it. 
2307 4 Speedy delivery, great value. Bought these accessories for my GoPro Hero (Basic Camera) - all appear well made & fit nicely, although some of the clips are quite tight ,but not a bad thing 
2308 3 Just completed setup of this cam. Works great! Controls on the app are a little clunky but the picture is great. 
2309 2 I ordered this in error [simply forgot a previous order for another brand]. It is tiny and seemed cheaply made, but I never took it out of the package. Its appearance and the lack of heft of the package were decisive in my returning this one, 
2310 3 A little pricey but fits perfectly. Wish they d make one for the CN-600 Chinese-made 1x1 light panel. 
2311 0 [[VIDEOID:1265e860a2218c46de5b2737a24b8ded]]The telescoping handle part works fine, but the phone holder attachment is horribly designed. Just watch my video to see how the phone shoots out of it! 
2312 2 2 work good, but one has dim IR LEDS 
2313 2 I haven t used this near as much as I d thought I would. I usually just plug the camera straight into a normal USB plug and swap the batteries through the camera. The spares are nice. 
2314 3 This works ok, but it s not as sturdy as I would like it to be. I would not recommend this for DSLRs that has a battery pack connected because its too heavy for this monopod. 
2315 4 Must have for speed light photography 
2316 4 Great camera sling. Holds camera to the side, out of the way. 
2317 4 Just as described 
2318 4 Great Picture and easy set up. Great tech support also.... 
2319 4 Excellent fit and smooth operation 
2320 4 very good work great 
2321 1 tough and well made, but terrible image quality. had to return it 
2322 4 GoPro...what else? 
2323 4 a 
2324 4 Great for single wire 
2325 4 Holds GoPro from going under 
2326 4 Fits the camera perfectly and is light. 
2327 4 Fit and worked great on my Nikon lenses. Old and modern models. 
2328 4 Amazing product. I need readers to check my photos on the LCD screen of my Canon EOS T3i and with this product I no longer have to change into my readers. Makes my workflow much faster. Really love this product! 
2329 4 Camera lens was mess up. Canon replace this camera with a other refur camera! 
2330 4 Nice Camera as a replacement for the one I had stollen, Easy to use and one I can understand! 
2331 4 Great accessory for GoPro hero 4 black. 
2332 0 does not work with wide angle lens ,bizzar colors on fringes of frame!! 
2333 3 Nice package! 
2334 0 Terrible product - cheap - couldn t get it off my Nikon lens after I installed it!!!! 
2335 2 A great little light for the price. It has a battery level indicator, dimmer knob and color temp selector and is quite bright even in daylight. The included battery and charger were a nice bonus and its quite slim which makes it easy to pack and carry. 
2336 4 Worked great and perfect fit on Nikon D7100. Came in hard case for glass with cleaning wipe and dust removing film to help install. 
2337 4 If you are a camera user, you are going to use it with the special strap. Best bang for the buck 
2338 3 I love this camera ,the only thing no manual 
2339 4 Perfect and handy to keep on the ready for that needed quick record. 
2340 2 Legit. 
2341 4 I love it. 
2342 0 Returned. Did not work. 
2343 4 It s good and I m happy with the product so far 
2344 3 Great lens for the price. Just wish it had gaskets like some of the others to make it water tight. But it does come with adapters for both naked camera and housing 
2345 4 Last as long as stock battery. 
2346 3 love these filters. very helpfull in my learning process. 
2347 4 Very clear picture and &#34;user friendly&#34; app. Great product. 
2348 3 Doing great so far! It s a great camera! Awesome zoom. The only problem i have with it is it didn t come with a cord to plug it into the computer. I had to go buy my own. It was a pain. But the camera itself is wonderful! 
2349 4 It was a little snug in my Kirkland carry on but works as expected. I would definitely recommend this product to family and friends. 
2350 1 It s hard to take a picture when case is attached, because it gets in the way. The quality of the product is as advertised. 
2351 2 Lens is great. Perfect for long shots. Filters are not great. They came scratched and one had a bubble defect. 
2352 4 Great camera with true colors. 
2353 4 Great quality screen protector. Well worth the price given the value of my NEX 7 camera. 
2354 4 love my contour, its been through a tough mudder on the first use, Still works and looks great, waiting for snowboarding season 
2355 4 cuando vuelve a estar disponible? no pude comprarlo when it becomes available ? I could not buy it 
2356 4 Came very fast and high quality!!! 
2357 3 sweet and fit perfect thank you 
2358 0 Battery just stop working after a month 
2359 4 I use this to hook up my mini beams projector weighing around 1 pound. No hassle and built with quality. 
2360 4 The Slik replacement post is an excellent product and a much better bargain than I ve found other places. As these little gems are easily lost I m pleased to know where to find them at a reasonable price. 
2361 4 Perfect and arrived on time. Thanks. 
2362 4 Works perfectly. 
2363 4 Worked great with more than enough lighting. I ordered 2 and received 4. I guess that was my mistake, so now if I return the extra order they will charge me shipping. I guess I will just keep in my storage. Or if one breaks.. 
2364 4 At first I thought it wouldn t work because there were two prongs on the charger and three contacts on the batteries. However, I put in a battery, the light turned red, and it turned blue when it was charged. Then the battery worked fine in my camera. 
2365 4 Nice 
2366 3 Extra padding for when you load up your bag - works well. 
2367 0 Jim needs help to install this item. There are no directions nor installing device. 
2368 4 VERY NICE 
2369 4 perfect, work just like the original, maybe better due to longer life of each charge 
2370 4 Excellent fit and finish - although it cost more than the other brands I feel it s worth it. Dislike the cheap copy cat hoods. 
2371 1 In the description it said it was compatable with my camera, after opening the package the batteries didn t even come close to fitting. The company was very easy to work with and issuing a refund 
2372 4 It does what I purchased it for, protect my lens. Solid. 
2373 4 An amazing new &#34;toy&#34; for me to use to take photos. 
2374 4 They really work very well! 
2375 4 FREAKING AWESOME!!!! And so much more! 
2376 4 High quality product, great price, fast shipping. It fits perfectly to my Sony A77 and very convenient, When I don t use it just close it down. Thanks for great product. 
2377 4 I bought this as part of the Indigogo campaign and can definitely recommend it. It is well thought out, simple to use, quick to set up and easy to install! Definitely good value and recommended! 
2378 3 Quality case perfectly fits my gear. 
2379 4 good 
2380 4 ok 
2381 1 It s very thin and cheaply made (I guess you get what you pay for). I am not happy with this product at the moment. I will attempt to hang it and take a few photos too see how it shows up on camera. 
2382 4 Had this camera in red and lost it on a trip. I love the camera and wanted to replace it. 
2383 4 excellent product 
2384 4 Batteries 
2385 3 I wish the padded strip was a little but wider because my Canon G7X is somewhat heavy which makes the this strip uncomfortable. 
2386 0 Not happy spent alot of money for something that doesnt work. Emailed seller about it no reply of course. So i guess no refund 
2387 4 great starter kit 
2388 4 Very happy with the item. batteries charge quickly. The cleaning kit was a bonus as I hadn t expected that to be included. (was originally looking for charger and batteries.) 
2389 4 I suppose they work fine, or my daughter would have said something. The pack was a great buy for what you get, and if you plan on taking a camera anywhere, you ll definitely want a couple extra battery packs. 
2390 4 NICE TO HAVE 
2391 4 Very nice small case for a very small price:) 
2392 3 Decent quality, easy to apply 
2393 3 great balance between a pro camera and your phone camera. Portable and easy to use. Goes through batteries like mad, though, recommend ordering a few extra and a portable charger. 
2394 4 thanks 
2395 4 This is what I ask for and was on time shipping. 800ft of wire, you can not beat the price! 
2396 4 This light is brilliant! The adjustments are great, it has a digital display on the back. It is completely silent too! 
2397 4 Love this lens 
2398 3 Far better price than OEM. Batteries have held up well since purchase 1 1/2 years ago. Though OEM battery tends to last longer. 
2399 4 Excellent bag 
2400 4 Filter was delivered on time and is a good value for the money. 
2401 4 Perfect! 
2402 4 This is an awesome set for my Casio coolpic camera. It will be nice to have the second battery for back up as well as the car charger. It is a great price for all that you get 
2403 3 Camera is very good... 
2404 2 Good camera, good quality video. My biggest complaint is that when you are reviewing what has been recorded you cant fast forward. That s very frustrating. 
2405 4 Great value! Seller ships quickly. Product is just as described. I was expecting the bag to be smaller and of lesser quality and was pleasantly surprised. 
2406 4 Nice room space 
2407 4 LOVE IT!!!! its exactly what you see online, it also shipped super fast. :) 
2408 4 I haven t used this selfie stick much so I am still learning what all it can do but what I have used it for I am VERY happy with it s performance. 
2409 4 This is my walk-around lens for my A6000. It s a really good lens, for the price. If you use Lightroom, which has a lens profile for it, you can easily fix photos taken with it (barrel, etc). Definitely my favorite Sony lens to date. 
2410 4 Works perfectly 
2411 0 No button to take pictures! Useless 
2412 0 No paper work won t buy again 
2413 4 Easy to install, just 3M tape peel and stick. So far so good, but it s only been 1 day. The angle adjustment is great as well. 
2414 4 Actually showed up 2 weeks earlier than estimated. Was exactly what was pictured and it s actually a pretty good camera. 
2415 3 too small to properly contain camera... 
2416 0 Do not purchase. I was able to use the lens a few times with my iPhone 3s before everything just fell apart. 
2417 3 Item as described, acceptable shipping time, thanks 
2418 4 Processed, received as anticipated without delay or issue. 
2419 1 Piece of garbage! It broke within three minutes of me taking it out of the box! definitely want money back. 
2420 4 great products. Thanks 
2421 4 Fits perfectly in my Hardig case. The foam was easy to pluck to fit the items that I put in the case 
2422 4 Awesome. Comfortable all day with a heavy camera and lens combination. Great design! 
2423 4 Just got this for my birthday and I love it. The instructions are very easy to follow and the pictures come out great. My only advice is to make sure that you take pictures closer than you normally would because the pictures are small. I would recommend buying. 
2424 4 Great deal! 
2425 4 A 
2426 4 Great 
2427 4 GooD 
2428 4 Very happy with my Canon ESO Rebel T5i Digital Camera. It take wonderful pictures and easy to use! 
2429 3 Works as designed. Not meant for high impact use but gets the job done. 
2430 4 Hard to find, worked as expected 
2431 4 GREAT .... Love It ! ! 
2432 4 Very happy with it 
2433 4 Excellent lens and worth the money. Great service from Amazon. 
2434 4 Everything came as described. The battery is compatible with my Canon camcorder and the battery indicator shows up on the screen. 
2435 4 I bought this camera for my granddaughter for her 8th grade graduation and she loved it. 
2436 4 looks like it is the real thing. Works great quality 
2437 4 Great product. Works perfectly for elder parents who leave their sliding door unlocked. 
2438 4 Fit my go pro hero 4 like a sheep skin glove :) 
2439 4 I am a big hit again. My grandaughter thinks this is the cats meow. Loves loves it 
2440 3 Meets my standard for the cost. My son enjoyed a week of flying, but then the drone did as all before it..... Took a dive. 
2441 3 good item and excellent seller 
2442 4 This is EXACTLY what I needed! I bought this to use my Canon 580EX speedlight off camera and would have paid double/triple the amount. I Have had the opportunity to use it many times and it has never failed me. 
2443 4 does its job!! 
2444 4 Very sturdy. Very user friendly. Best customer service ever!!! 
2445 4 great 
2446 2 When it works, it s what I expected, but this disconnects very frequently which is frustrating. 
2447 3 Pros:Easy to set up.the feature to show which switch is on is a good idea Cons: LCD screen almost npossable to read. 
2448 4 cheap and holds full and long charge 
2449 3 Pretty decent for the price!!! 
2450 4 Can not find SN at the filter. It seem that s normal. If there are seal at both side will be better! 
2451 4 Worked well for placing my camera on a strap and folding to put my camera on a tripod, it is a hassle sometimes as the loop is not solid but that is what makes it be able to fit onto certain camera mounts. 
2452 4 Good product 
2453 4 Love this case, my Nikon 7100 with the Tamron 150-600 mm lens fit perfect. You have to remove the lens hood and reverse it over the lens. Camera an lens slide out with no problem. Wide padded strap makes it very comfortable to carry. I highly recommend this case. 
2454 4 Fits perfectly. 
2455 0 not worth it even if free - bad photos - battery compartments won t stay closed - everytime battery comes out loses memory. One of the 2 didn t even work had to send back. 
2456 0 Actual product User manual says sd card (the PDF), Amazon description says sd card, I bought a SD CARD. It in fact uses a micro sd card. Sad... 
2457 0 Lens adaptors are tricky to make as designers, except for the Maxuum-Sony Alpha systems, do not make cameras with consistent thicknesses. 
2458 4 Great product 
2459 4 Fantastic purchase came really quickly works great. 
2460 4 Awesome 
2461 3 good 
2462 4 Excellent Bino s for the price. Very good focus and clarity. 
2463 4 Used it thankyou 
2464 4 It s the best one I ve used. 
2465 0 I just use this camera just 3 times .but, shutter it s not working.I don t like it 
2466 3 So far, everything works well in this kit. I use it with my Canon T3i. The softbox was a bit damaged but nothing that could not be fixed with a bit of glue. 
2467 0 directions were in chinese:/ 
2468 4 Best Camera I ever have had. 
2469 4 Good product 
2470 3 Great little grip for my E-M5 Mark ii. The only downside is that trying to replace the battery is somewhat of a chore, however the Lock/Unlock dial does make this somewhat less of a hassle. 
2471 4 Love it! 
2472 2 Excellent optics, great at its primary function but not enough thread to properly secure my hood lead to it being lost. 
2473 1 Zero firmware updates. Need ActiveX to configure Motion Detection. Why is this old junk still for sale? 
2474 3 It works well with Canon 5Dii; but it lacks the shoe to attach to the camera, i would reduce it to 4 stars. 
2475 3 Worked great while on the road. Kept the camera dry and dust free. 
2476 4 Love this poser! It took about 30-45 minutes to fill. It does help to use a cardboard tube to guide the beanbag beans. Made the process much smoother! 
2477 2 very blocky when at max magnification. 
2478 4 Very well made item. I tried a cheaper after mkt. grip and it was next to worthless. This Sony grip is quick and looks great. 
2479 1 Doesn t stay connected as well as I d like, but with some ingenuity I made it work. 
2480 4 Good lense 
2481 4 great product 
2482 4 Works perfect. Good Value. 
2483 0 Cheap Junk don t buy it. It don t work right out of the box. now I m stuck with it and out the money. 
2484 4 Charged fast batteries work fine. 
2485 4 Awesome stuff 
2486 4 I bought this as a gift for my hubby and he loves it. Great for his camera and other stuff .he loves the different compartment...it s his weekend bag. 
2487 4 packed for earthquake, just as expected from add 
2488 3 Hard to get the velcro band tight, otherwise it worked 
2489 4 1st test of my Limefuel L55G3 on Hero3+ was a timelapse, 2sec interval at 7mp per. The battery lasted 14 hours and 16 minutes, 48.9GB on the card. Amazing. 
2490 3 Works as expected. 
2491 3 Great product as advertised 
2492 4 Fits my Nikon D600 like a glove :) 
2493 3 It s what I needed. 
2494 4 Great Product. Im happy with it. 
2495 4 Very nice for travel 
2496 2 Pretty disappointing. I want a 15-in + frame to display professional quality photos and so far have found nothing that seems to please other discriminating viewers. Surely someone must make a quality frame. Cost is not a major factor but quality is top priority. Anyone have suggestions? 
2497 4 Too bad it is no longer in production! 
2498 4 The best sandals for pronation and very comfortable. I have to wear orthopedics, but can wear these sandals for a few hours and have no pain.Good support for feet. 
2499 4 the GoPro works great! the picture and video quality is amazing. Definitely the best product I ve bought in a while. 
2500 4 Works as described ~ fast delivery. 
2501 4 Great item, plan on it going traveling with me and to sports events. 
2502 4 Great. Like all aspects of this camera. Telephoto is fantastic. 
2503 2 Does what I need, but &#34;pole&#34; which comes in sections is pretty flimsy. I wouldn t last long outdoors. Luckily, we need it in the garage. 
2504 3 Worked perfectly and arrived ahead of schedule. 
2505 4 Excellent picture, easy install and setup. Adding extra cameras is very simple. I m quite pleased. 
2506 4 Paired up with my Note 4 really quick and i like the way it fits. I like the ability to unsnap the measuring unit as well. Good price well see how it holds up 
2507 3 I would like that has buttons to zoom in and out. But works ok 
2508 0 It s so obvious that these are all fake reviews, who runs a business like this? 
2509 3 For the price this is an excellent Item. The batteries last a long while and the brightness is superb. I m a high schools sports videographer and I do on field/court interviews and the lights worked much better than expected. 
2510 4 Works as advertised. 
2511 4 This is a great alternative for the clip in lens cap. I bought it based on all the positive reviews it received and am glad I did. 
2512 1 Looses electric connection after a few weeks. Wouldn t recommend getting. 
2513 0 There is no way to use an ocular (eyepiece) lens with this adapter. As a result there is no way to focus the microscope image in the camera. Spend about $90 instead and get an adapter with a lens included. 
2514 4 love this camera 
2515 4 LOVE THIS CAMERA! So easy to use, directions and set up very simple. No difficult wiring or issues! The quality of the picture is amazing also. Would strongly recommend this camera! Super simple and great product! 
2516 4 Item was as described, was delivered promptly, and worked with my old FD lens. Will shop with this vendor again. 
2517 3 I wish the strap held together a bit better but other wise it s a great looking case and it shipped right on time. 
2518 3 It is OK, have not actually broken in yet therefore will not know how long the battery will last. 
2519 1 Really weak and flimsy, overall wished I spent more money on a strap. 
2520 4 Awesome is all I can say 
2521 4 Perfect for indoor photography! 
2522 4 great for the price 
2523 4 so glad to have this replacement for my camera...perfect 
2524 4 gift 
2525 3 Good bargain price for batteries that do the same as OEM batteries. I was in Washington on business and searched the whole area for this battery, found one store with one unit in stock. These work great and hold a charge well. 
2526 4 As expected. 
2527 4 GOOD PRODUCT, WELL CONSTRUCTED EASY TO HANDLE AND DO THE JOB VERY GOOD. I LOVE IT AND I RECOMENDED. 
2528 4 works great,enjoy the different settings and sounds on windy days I believe my flag sets it off,will have to reposition it. 
2529 4 Very good. 
2530 2 as predicted. 
2531 4 Great product! Very useful and practical! 
2532 4 This Film works just fine in a new (to me) camera that I just bought. 
2533 4 Great quality tripod. Works with my SLR camera, andreally helps for those longer exposures 
2534 4 LOUD. If you want to make sure people know when your alarm goes off, get this. 
2535 0 Cheap, flimsy & very small. Also the 2 tire &#34;stops&#34; were paid for but not shipped. Shipping time was fine. 
2536 3 BLAST CAN USE IT ANYWHERE 
2537 4 The battery fits and works great. I use it in a Canon 60D and it charges at about the same rate as the factory battery. I have only had it for a couple of weeks, so nothing to report on longevity. 
2538 4 Works well for my Canon camera 
2539 4 Just as described with super fast shipping! 
2540 0 inner partitions does not stay in place 
2541 4 Wow how freaking awesome! I ordered and a day later it came to my front door. The batteries work and hold a great charge and the charger sits on my desk taking NO room. Very happy and for the price I might just buy another set. 
2542 4 Fast shipping good battery! I would recommend as a spare battery :) 
2543 4 works exactly as described. Paired easily. Works with iPad, no problem. 
2544 4 Great lens ! My significant other purchased this for me as a surprise and absolutely love it! Will be great for portraits instead of having to rent nice lenses. Seems to do the best around f 3.2 and 3.5 , very crisp details and nice bokeh! 
2545 4 Excellent purchase! 
2546 3 Good however could not get strap to stay on. 
2547 4 I like it 
2548 4 I love these batteries, I use them in my Cannon 70 D. What an amazing addition to my camera and at the price you can t say no. Well worth it. 
2549 4 It worked perfectly with my Cannon 60D. 
2550 4 Bought used and VERY satisfied 
2551 4 Small and compact! Ready for on the go and easy to use. 
2552 4 Works excellent with very easy set up. Took about 10 minutes total. Mounted it to a wall with included hardware and we were ready to go. Works on both my Samsung S5 and my wife s iPhone 6. 
2553 4 it fits well on my gopro hero 3+ waterproof housing 
2554 2 Just testing it out I found that the Wi-Fi did not work despite the phone or laptop and the battery life is poor. Still waiting to take it to the sea and see if it is really &#34;water proof&#34; to up to 90 feet. 
2555 4 Work great and are WAY cheaper than OEM. 
2556 4 Very nice cleaning cloths. They are the perfect size for cleaning glasses & cell phones. I also like the variety of colors. 😀 
2557 1 Had to return as it never worked. Return was easy enough. 
2558 0 Very cheaply made. Feels cheaply made. My copy activated the shutter just by jiggling the wires 
2559 3 Just what I was looking, looks great on my Nikon D5500 with 18-140 lens 
2560 1 This product worked about 3hours then 2 of the motors burned out. One wont even turn junk!!! 
2561 4 Really works it saved us from flooded home. 
2562 3 Love the device. First generation needed a wider lens, but looks like the second generation has that covered. 
2563 2 It has slipped off a couple times. But in fairness, I may not have put it entirely on. It doesn t fit over the lens filters I purchased. 
2564 4 Excellent product at a good price. It works flawlessly with my Panasonic FZ200. My only criticism for this device, as other reviewers have commented, is that the device is not very intuitive and the documentation is cryptic at best. 
2565 4 Works Awesome! One of the easiest Pano heads I have ever used. 
2566 4 I am using this for my canon camera. For the price, it is excellent. I like the size and the material is good. 
2567 4 Works pretty much exactly as I wanted. Let s me use my Sigma 30mm f1.4 and my old Minolta MD 150mm on the M3. 
2568 4 These replacement batteries fit and work great 
2569 4 excellent 
2570 3 worked as advertised but complicated to set up remote access. Had to get tech help and working remotely now. 
2571 3 this was just what i needed...it works great...thanks for the help finding this on amazon.. 
2572 4 Thankyou 
2573 4 Liked the design for a certain bridge I bridge camera I own. 
2574 4 Glad to have another way to charge my batteries. I love that this charger came with 2 extra batteries as well. 
2575 4 Using this on my Tokina 11-16mm dxii. No vignetting and no image degradation. Screws on and off effortlessly. Love the textured grip? 
2576 4 Pelican products are very well-made. This particular case is small. If you need more space, Pelican makes many more models from which to choose. 
2577 4 Efficient , Thanks 
2578 0 [[ASIN:B00W1BEENK AC 110V 3 Way Touch Control Sensor Switch Dimmer Lamp Desk Light Parts]] Easy install, seemed to work but in less than a week it started turning on the light by itself. This has continued since I installed it. How do I get a replacement?? 
2579 3 Work very well, sometimes the camera reads the battery power level incorrectly but this is fairly rare. 
2580 0 Wore it to play in a beer league hockey tournament and it stopped working properly after the 1st day. Do not recommend it 
2581 4 This now completes my set up. I have ordered one of these before and have had no problems. I expect the same, this time around. Easy to install and should at least slow the bad guys down. 
2582 4 Better and cheaper than GO Pro! The Wi-Fi and the SONY App are awesome! I can control the camera by my mobile!!!! 
2583 2 It works but would not work with Chrome. Contacted support and got no reply. I don t think I would by another one. 
2584 4 Works great. Perfect fit. Feels pretty solid. 
2585 4 as described. Very happy with it. 
2586 0 There is less then year when I bought this camera and it doesnt work anymore 
2587 3 Small, and easy to use. Pictures are good. I just wish I would have notice that the review size was really small. Otherwise good deal. 
2588 4 Sharp Optics, Light Weight, Easy to use, Nothing better available in a Zoom 8-16x25 for the price! Very pleased with its performance. 
2589 4 My wife and I love our new Nest cam. It works exactly as billed and we love having a Nest home. 
2590 4 Works great - a must have! 
2591 2 works pretty good, not great a night...really bummed that it doesnt have extra ports for more cameras-4 doesnt even cover my exterior. you would think they would have extra ports so you could add on if necessary 
2592 4 I love this lens cap. I like the squeeze on and off. It s very secure yet easy to remove. No, it doesn t dangle from the string, but it could be attached to a longer more useful string if you wanted that feature. I just removed the string. 
2593 4 As advertised, great. 
2594 4 Must have for DSLR users that don t always shoot over the shoulder. 
2595 4 would recommend 
2596 4 Quick delivery excellent product. It is a little narrow for my big old head, but not a BIG deal. 
2597 4 Arrived on time and as expected. 
2598 4 My son commented my videos look much better since using device. 
2599 4 Excellent connectors. Do their job insuring a secure camera attachment. Don t have to worry about clips opening and spilling your expensive camera on the ground. The Op/Tech clips do seem very adequate to secure camera but the Velcro connectors give extra piece of mind, just in case... 
2600 4 It is a great product it met my expectations it is awesome to use it on big places and see the difference between a normal lense and a fish eye or wide angle 
2601 3 This is a very lightweight tripod and seems to be very steady. It will take some practice to use it quickly though. This isn t a complaint. Its much lighter than my other tripod and I plan to take it on some field trips later this year. 
2602 4 Does what it promises to do. 
2603 0 disappointed in the filter. didn t think it enhanced the images nearly as much as I d hoped 
2604 4 Perfect. Precisely what I ordered. As described. 
2605 4 does exactly what it should. works great! 
2606 4 these camera replacements are excellent for my system and a great buy, will definitely recommend these to my friends and family. 
2607 3 You get what you pay for, all lens are good but the Telephoto Lens distords the image on the sides and has to be used at maximum zoom or you will see the round black edges on your screen. 
2608 0 cheap and weak 
2609 4 Awesome accessories! Great price! 
2610 4 Great Quality - we recommend this item! I ve waited a long time for the perfect digital camera!!! 
2611 4 Great price and good condition 
2612 3 the remote control is included? 
2613 4 Needs to send a charger with it. 
2614 4 Awesome battery for the money, great customer service after the sale also. 
2615 4 As usual the case is top notch Pelican Case. Have been using Pelicans for my firearms for years so I got the 1300 for my girls Sony DSLR camera. Pick-n-pluck foam is easy and holds gear securely and it does have the double throw latches. 
2616 3 Works very well, needs 9 V batteries 2 times a year and re-positioning but I have had it for about six years now and it s still ringing, 
2617 4 Incredible deal for the price. I ve seen others for three times the price! 
2618 0 Although the labeling read &#34;Product generally ordered when lens is purchased&#34;, the fact is the product is not needed since the lens already come with a shield. 
2619 4 Great 
2620 3 Awesome 
2621 4 I bought this lens to replace the plastic nifty 50 I ve had for a while. I can see right off, this lens is quite good, but probably not as good as the top of the line 50mm. But,I like it. 
2622 4 Universal camera battery charger. Product as described and has adaptors for different brands. Charger says its a Vivitar but with an adapter that fits my Canon camera. Works great and comes with a spare battery. 
2623 4 Excellent! 
2624 4 Finally!!! An awesome gadget backpack, for all the chargers, ereaders, camera, lens, videocamera, sdcards, cables. There is room for everything. Great for travelling and keeping all our stuff organized. 
2625 4 i use 
2626 3 Lots of pockets, lightweight and easy to carry. Makes you look official :) 
2627 4 Item shipped quickly and was exactly as described. 
2628 0 Great bag, holds more than it looks like, would recommend it 
2629 0 THEY DID NOT WORK ON ANY DEVICE!!!!! 
2630 3 Lots of useful items in the kit , charger is worth the price alone 
2631 1 Ok for a monopod, feels cheap and unsteady with a Nikon d610 attached. Good enough for a point and shoot though. Upgraded to a a Manfrotto monopod shortly after purchasing this. Should have just skipped this one. 
2632 4 Works great. Let s me use old manual lens with my Sony a6000. 
2633 4 Camera is good. Setup instructions are not clear. But you will figure out after trying few times. I like phone view and send pics by email. I am not using upload to cloud feature 
2634 4 What do you say, They work great! 
2635 4 Excellent product 
2636 3 I have been using these pens for a few years and i like them for the convenience mainly.They do their job and are light and compact. 
2637 4 An excellent camera with excellent accessories. The camera arrived quickly and was well packed. 
2638 0 Cheap threads stuck 
2639 0 First day I had it battery overheated and fried all electronics. Video quality was radically bad after that!. I checked and it was a genuine product, but I got a lemon. Also batery refused to charge after that! 
2640 4 I love my new album it matches my camera so cute thank you 
2641 3 Works Good! 
2642 4 excelent 
2643 4 Received what you order. It came in a timely manner. 
2644 0 I was very excited for my wife to take professional photos of my baby daughter but honestly our I phone has better resolution not happy 
2645 3 I am still learning to use it so will have a better idea of how I like it after more use. 
2646 4 Works well. No stability but for the money it is a good lens. Quick focus but not as fast as the more expensive lenses out there. 
2647 3 Works well. Fits well It would be nice to have threads on both ends so you could stack them. 
2648 4 Love it. Perfect Bag. 
2649 4 Worked out great on a trip up to Pacific Northwest. Protected from rain and dust. Thanks 
2650 4 everything worked fine 
2651 4 Great, economical surveillance system. Easiest Tech I have set up. 
2652 3 Great lenses, great pictures, great price. Not noisy at all. The remote works great and lots of fun. The tripod is a little week but does the job and very light. 
2653 4 Well made and works great. 
2654 4 So far so good, haven t noticed any issues. Quick delivery as always using Prime. 
2655 4 This is my go to portrait lens for natural light portraits. At 2.8 it makes a powerful low light lens plus a nice portrait lens for shallow depth of field for nice bokeh. For the price this is an excellent lens. 
2656 4 Great product. Shipped all together. It s a great gift for teens. 
2657 4 This camara is better than I EXPECETED. Great. 
2658 0 The case blocks the cameras ability to connect to the wireless access point. If you buy this you better have the camera within about 25 feet of your access point 
2659 4 nice product. 
2660 4 GREAT PROTECTION FOR CAMERA. 
2661 4 This is just what I needed. It works fine. I love Canon products. I just misplaced my original one. 
2662 2 Did not notice there was no way to take the picture with the stick 
2663 4 Ok 
2664 1 I found what I wanted and I was really excited. But when it came in the mail it was the wrong product. 
2665 4 A+++ 
2666 4 A nice bit of added security when going strapless. 
2667 4 Great way to get my footage 
2668 4 Works great. Peace of mind when you are away from home. 
2669 3 Expected this to be a little better but i will definitely use. The dimmer capability is nice but wish they were just a tad brighter. For the price i guess i can t complain. 
2670 3 My daughter likes it. 
2671 4 This kit is awesome!! Thanks)) 
2672 4 Product recieved as described and in the time frame as specified. 
2673 3 I bought this for my Sony A6000 it works great. I took my time cleaning and cleaning the screen again it went on well and with no air bubbles. It did not add any bulk to the camera and I feel better knowing the screen is protected. 
2674 0 this does not work with hero 1 
2675 3 some of the stuff in this bundle is great, and some is cheap. bottom line is if you are not a pro, this is a great cheap bundle. I wouldn t pull these out for a professional photo shoot. 
2676 4 Good 
2677 4 Charged and powered my camera as expected. Good product. 
2678 4 Great bag for the price. Camera and lenses in padded secure, yet movable sections. I am impressed by the quality of this product. 
2679 1 screw not Tight enough for nexus 7, can not support 
2680 4 what can I say, expect for incredible. 
2681 4 Good 
2682 4 Received on time & seems to work fine. 
2683 4 Excellent and great seller 
2684 4 This floating hand grip works great. It s comfortable and secure. I took it to Hawaii and got some awesome snorkeling and waterfall photos & video. Glad I opted for the GoPro brand - high quality, fits my GoPro perfectly. 
2685 3 the case holds a ton of stuff. i ve got a couple housings and naked housings in there with the headstrap, cables, dual battery charger and mounts and it still fits extremely well. 
2686 4 Nice bags will last a long time. 
2687 4 Awesome 
2688 4 Does just what I expected. Autofocus is slow and hunts, but for landscape work it s not a problem. Main thing I purchased it for was aperture control and it does the job nicely. I recommend it 
2689 3 This is a very nicely made cap, and the strap is a good add-on. Not sure where (or how) to attach the strap but overall it s nice constructed and lightweight. 
2690 4 The lens cases are excellent quality at a very reasonable price. I would highly recommend them. Bill Dunlap, EasternSierraPhotography.com 
2691 4 Perfect fit for my nikon d5300 and a spare small lens 
2692 4 Quality SCT diagonal both optically as well as fit and finish. Comes with a great case that protects it very well. The price is the most reasonable found for a 2&#34; dielectric diagonal for an SCT. 
2693 1 D-rate too low, zeiss lens does not show good Saturation, Effective focus range too little, dont expect it can make any bokeh or blurry background at all. 
2694 4 I probably us this more than any other accessory for my GoPro... 
2695 0 I never could get this to work properly, don t waist your money 
2696 4 Great tripod! Not very light but still easy to carry around. Love feature on coverting it to monopod. Ball head is good too. Easy to adjust. Color nice and vivid. The only downside is a tighting bolt which i wish had a different design. 
2697 0 waste moeny at all 
2698 4 nice 
2699 4 I really like this camera. My only complaint is the LED on top is hard to see in the sunlight. It takes really good video. Its size makes it easy to take anywhere. The waterproof case works very well and is worth buying. 
2700 4 Decent batteries, will buy again. Some people have trouble taking the battery out of the charger, little pressure toward the way the arrow points and the battery comes out easy. 
2701 3 This may be small in size, but it is a good aluminum alloy...It locks without much effort, and holds my 3 pound camera very securely.. This one may cost a bit more, but your trusting it by putting very expensive cameras on it...So I highly recommend it... 
2702 4 I actually ordered this for my ring bearer so he could feel like a spy with a briefcase. He loved it! (And, all the stuff I put inside.) :) Great size! Just what I was looking for! Not small! 
2703 4 Satisfied! 
2704 4 need to get more. lovely gift. 
2705 4 Perfect for water use 
2706 4 Awesome! Everything was in perfect condition when it arrived. 
2707 4 Love it. Took it on a cruise and got great pics! 
2708 0 Cheap 
2709 4 Just as advertised 
2710 4 I was worried about ordering any electronics from online, but I had nothing to worry about. It was excellent condition!! Works beautifully and gets the job done!! LOW priced and fast shipping!! Feel safe when ordering from this seller!! Thank you!! 
2711 3 The remote control (RM-E2) does not work with the Nikon D3200 as indicated in the description of the set. 
2712 4 just what I needed 
2713 4 Have not had a bad experience with any of the Polaroid filters, so far. 
2714 4 Add a little brightness to your photos 
2715 4 great pics 
2716 0 The screen on the viewer has developed a line thru the center of the screen after owning it for one month, also frustrating to try to set up the recording to meet my needs, I guess you get what you pay for, not recommended!! 
2717 3 Not 100% waterproof 
2718 4 Floaty was great! Arrived on time and was just as described. Attached to my underwater camera and it really does float! 
2719 4 works great 
2720 3 Works great. 
2721 4 it works ... 
2722 3 Great cloths, they work just fine. 
2723 3 Works as well as or better than the &#34;official&#34; batteries at a much more favorable price and the charger is easier to use and transport that the factory-issued model. 
2724 4 Item as described. shipped quickly. Would purchase again. A+ 
2725 0 didn t work on my camera. I returned it. 
2726 4 good choice well worth the money. 
2727 4 This light is very small but very very bright. I will buy another one as it will only last for 1 hr. But it completely brightened the entire room. 
2728 4 Perfect protection for LCD screen. Real easy to install. Does not interfere with opening or closing screen. Wish I had this before the LCD became tarnished. Certainly priced right. 
2729 0 Battery lasted less than 50 shots. Return policy of 30 days stinks, since it does not seem to depend on whether product is defective or not. 
2730 4 Batteries are long lasting in my cameras. I will recommend these because they are the best 
2731 3 camera is great and all the add-ons were just what was shown. was disappointed taht there was not any user manual or other instructions on the use of the camera 
2732 2 kind of flimsy. 
2733 4 I think this is a great camera and quality of the video is on par with others. The audio output could be better but that s very minor. 
2734 3 This is a very good case, it s just that it s a little larger than what I needed for my camera. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. I think it will last forever and there is definitely room for extra batteries and all the cords. 
2735 3 Great pistol grip head. Just wish it was lighter. Beside this, it is a good deal. 
2736 4 These are a great way to keep an eye on your home. Great for constant visibility or just to check in occasionally. 
2737 4 Love it!!! 
2738 4 Works great.glad I purchased. I ve had some close calls when using my go pro in the lakes. 
2739 4 Very good case for my Tough4 camera. It fits perfectly! A great case. 
2740 3 Nice 
2741 4 The order came quickly and was a very great deal. 
2742 4 Better than the goPro stick! Very sturdy and I love the pouch for it! Best purchase I ve made in regards to an accessory. Very very pleased - never leave without it. 
2743 4 excelente 
2744 4 Henry great job done by tech. love the service.also camera works great. 
2745 4 Great for the price! Never owned or used a &#34;glidecam&#34; before. For my micro-budget films this thing is AWESOME. 
2746 2 It couldve been better but for the price what do you really expect? I dont really use it as much as I hoped I would because of its quality. 
2747 4 Very Well Satisfied. 
2748 3 should get two batterys for that price 
2749 4 Good product, great service, plus a good price! Paid a few dollars more for the &#34;warm fuzzies&#34; for the familiar Vivitar name.. 
2750 4 Ok 
2751 4 Very comfy and durable! Fit my camera perfectly and adjustable for when my husband wants to wear it! 
2752 4 Just awesome telphoto 
2753 4 Received as advertised 
2754 0 It is too red and not good for diving. 
2755 2 An OK lens but not for advanced photographers. 
2756 4 I love this gadget! I rarely have to charge it. If I use it with my computer, I will need to charge it more frequently but with other devices it just goes and goes. So glad I bought it. 
2757 3 Works great so far. I have not had a chance to assess longevity of the charge or of the battery itself. 
2758 4 Exact needed miniscule USB to standard cable for Nikon Coolpix as advertised. Plenty pleased. 
2759 4 This is the best Quadcopter out for the price by far! So easy to fly and the best 4K video. I find myself looking forward to flying it after work and on the weekends! This thing is loaded with tech and the flight control system is loaded with many features! 
2760 4 Great 
2761 4 Another excellent pelican product 
2762 4 Fantastic! Exactly as described! 
2763 4 Great product, still going strong a year later. I would recommend this battery to anyone. 
2764 3 the greatest thing to come around since sliced bread if you do green screen photography 
2765 4 BUY THIS KIT!!!! It is definitely worth investing in, and I film beauty videos and such and THIS LIGHTING KIT IMPROVES THE QUALITY 100%!!!! You can go see at www.youtube.com/daisygoldenprincess 
2766 4 this product real make a different I will order from this company again. 
2767 4 Easy to use, good quality!! 
2768 4 Great mount 
2769 4 works great 
2770 2 Product was as advertised. 
2771 4 Love this little thing. It s a lot bigger than it appears to be in the photo. I got it for my gopro hero 4 silver and it s amazing. 
2772 4 Quite nice and handy wireless remote. I use it with my D5300 and found it to be quite good. 
2773 4 All is working fine! 
2774 4 Nice case, fits our camera well, plus extra batteries. 
2775 2 ok 
2776 3 Magnification is not as much as I expected. Focus knob has no fine tune focus. Barlow lense is low quality. But a good basic telescope for the price. 
2777 4 love this dash cam 
2778 4 Works great and works with our camera and battery charger. 
2779 3 Great item. 
2780 0 It is not mentioned that the flash is working with manual adjusting - I would have never bought it!!! 
2781 4 Quick service and great product. Exactly what I needed 
2782 4 My Minolta A mount lenses mount firmly with this adapter. 
2783 4 Fits perfect! Can t believe I got a 5 pk for this price! These fit snuggly so I may not lose them as often. Prompt delivery too.......I typically wait much longer for items from China. 
2784 4 I think they are great, could not find them locally, my camera works great, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING THEM.... 
2785 4 It s a battery. It works fine. 
2786 4 Pelican just makes great cases. Not much else to be said. 
2787 4 Anyone else keep losing these guys? Just bought this 5 pack. Problem solved. 
2788 4 Excellent Quality and speedy shipping! 
2789 4 The camera works great, nice control, night vision good Kenneth from tech support helped with setup, great job 
2790 3 Great machine but get extra parts and batteries. Great starter drone. 
2791 4 I bought this for my fiancé (who is a graphic artist) and he loves it! It has lots of high end features to take AMAZING pictures with a quality rivaling professional photographers. This is a great camera! 
2792 4 awesome just as described thank 
2793 4 best towel for cleaning anything 
2794 4 very good 
2795 4 Cool 
2796 4 Buy as many as you can! I use them for everything. 
2797 4 Very fast autofocus, brilliant image quality, and the stabilization is great too. My one gripe about this lens (and a reason I may sell it in the future) is that it s just really heavy! 
2798 4 Works good for my SonyRX100 2. Fits just like factory batteries, charger works fine. 
2799 0 Not what i was expecting 
2800 3 The lens kit brings the image into focus pretty well, but you need to use the tripod, or maybe I shake too much. Its a nice little piece that works better than others I ve tried. Takes a little while to learn to position it as you like. 
2801 3 Working well for my needs 
2802 4 Good 
2803 0 Button fell after a few weeks of receiving it, and not due to overuse! Unable to return item, had to purchase another. 
2804 4 Very happy with camera. Everything I hoped it would be for the price. 
2805 4 wonderful not heavy and very easy ti use 
2806 4 Great Product Works just like it is supposed to easy to install 
2807 4 Good deal! 
2808 1 The items in this shipment We re good quality but this does NOT come with a bag. My order did not include all items advertised. There was no carrying bag. 
2809 3 Really nice pictures clean.. 
2810 3 Nothing really crazy out of the ordinary here, it was just what I needed!! 
2811 4 Excellent product. Holds charge for a considerable amount of time, especially whan camera is not used frequently. Highly reccommended 
2812 0 I purchased this item and what was delivered was a 22 Inch after measuring the item. 
2813 4 Review coming soon 
2814 4 Love it! Light weight reasonably priced and great quality. 
2815 4 works great! 
2816 4 It works OK. 
2817 4 Excellent battery life on demanding go pro hero4 silver. (Touch screen on go pro saps a lot of battery) The batteries last longer than the original go pro battery. The charging was fairly quick. Three batteries in a couple of hours at the most. 
2818 3 Kinda small so you don t feel like a real photographer, but the product itself is perfect 
2819 0 Don t waste your money. It broke the second time I used it. Base plate came off. guess I could glue back together but that s not the point. 
2820 4 Fits my canon rebel perfectly. I feel my camera is safe and protected in there. 
2821 4 Very Good Quality 
2822 4 Bought this item to replace a lost charget. I is exactly what I needed and works perfectly. 
2823 0 It ruin my phantom 1 I have to take it to get fixed now it s very unstable and crash right out of the sky  
2824 3 The camera is smarter than I am. 
2825 0 I m still trying to make it work it seem to have a mind of it s own i keep down loading, it wont hold the programs. The booklet is being read step by step 
2826 4 Great 
2827 4 Easy to sign up for. I have not needed to make any claims, thankfully. So, I don t know how the replacement/repair service is. I hope I don t need it. I will update this post if I use the service later. 
2828 4 Great deal, good quality replacement. 
2829 4 Everything about this case is amazing great quality and carries everything I need! High recommend this. Just wish it was airline carry on size but the quality and features make up for it 
2830 4 I wasn t sure if adding the lens would make that much of a difference. I was very surprised to see how much it did. Good quality and easy to attach. 
2831 4 Nice size, lots of pockets for accessories, sturdy construction, good padding! 
2832 0 Takes lousy pictures. I don t want to have to monkey around with pics on my computer...I just want to print or share quickly. I returned this. Guess you get what you pay for! 
2833 4 Great product, wish this would have came with the unit from the manufacture. Must have! 
2834 4 Love the bag, great value, great size. 
2835 4 nice bundle 
2836 4 It s worth buying to protect your gopro. 
2837 4 Haven t taken this out to use for the reason I bought it yet, but it will work just fine, I m sure. Seems pretty well made. Better than expected. 
2838 4 great 
2839 4 came in a timely manner, was undamaged, inserted the battery and was good to go. thank you 
2840 4 Handy little tripod, I use this thing everywhere. Wrap it around tree branches, wrap it around strings to do time lapse vids of storms coming in from my garage door opener. Wherever, this holds steady. 
2841 4 Very happy with purchase!!! 
2842 4 Exact match for OEM and works great. 
2843 4 Love this bag, comes with tons of padding and movable sections inside to customize. Love the vintage style. So Happy I ordered it. 
2844 2 Gift 
2845 4 LOVE this lens and the transaction. thanks 
2846 2 Not exatly what I needed, but will do. 
2847 3 I like this bag. The canvas fabric is really attractive and nice, and it doesn t scream &#34;steal me&#34; like a Nikon logo bag. It s a little tight for my D5100 kit, but it fits. I have not had any problems with the zippers that other reviewers have noted. 
2848 4 GREAT SMOKE ALARMS..... 
2849 4 Works perfect!!!! 
2850 0 These cords failed within one month of use. 
2851 4 BEST VALUE YET. PACKAGING CAME EARLIER THAN EXPECTED. VERY PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE! 
2852 4 Fits snugly as it was advertised to do.Great adapter,I d highly recommend it. 
2853 4 Perfect fit for my a66; eye viewfinder activation works fine. 1/3 the cost of a Sony replacement. 
2854 4 Great pics! The app for the smart phone is a lil wonky but works 
2855 4 camera fits perfect 
2856 4 4 of them in my house can check in anytime I am away or use as monitor with my phone or tablet 
2857 3 Great Product and video for the money. 
2858 4 Great build. Much better than Gary Fong lightsphere. You would think the velcro wouldn t hold up but it actually stays up. This is a great product especially, very flexible from macro, portrait, to group shots this met all my needs. Would definitely buy again. 
2859 4 This camera is so much fun and it takes the best pictures if you know how to use it correctly! 
2860 4 so far as good as original 
2861 4 works perfectly just like the original 
2862 4 just what i needed 
2863 4 Clear Picture. Easy Set up. Works better than I expected. 
2864 4 This lens is everything that I ve hoped for! Great quality photos! Quick delivery and wonderful supplier! 
2865 4 A necessity! I am pleased with the quality. There were enough pieces that I share half with my daughter. 
2866 1 doesnt fit right to original hero 4 unit. 
2867 2 You get what you pay for in terms of battery life. One of these lasts about half as long as a single Cannon brand battery. 
2868 3 Good stand for the price paid. The locking knobs are not very durable. Just be careful using it. It will work well. 
2869 0 Ok gave to friend. He is modify from his cameas 
2870 4 great!!! 
2871 4 heavy duty boom arm, not a flimsy toy. very happy with the quality of all Kupo products 
2872 4 what a bargain 
2873 4 Excellent cameras. The video is extra sharp, and they are very easy to install. 
2874 3 No surprises. Works as described. Good shipping to third party that was heading to Fiji in plenty of time. 
2875 4 Best case I have ever owned for my GoPro Hero 4 Black. Almost nearly fits all my accessories, but I mainly got this because it s a hard case and I wanted to protect my investment. 
2876 4 I brought Targus Digital Black Label TG-P60T tripod from RadioShack (big mistake). The quick release plate that was given in the box didn t fit. I search high and low for a plate that ll fit since it s small, this one works. 
2877 4 Really easy to use right out of the box. Got some great shots at 70 feet despite poor visibility. I can t wait to see what it will do in Caribbean waters. 
2878 4 This product is very great! It is not as translucent as some of the others when using a backlog and is highly durable for portraits. Photos always come out stunning with a black background and plexiglass flooring! 
2879 4 excellent camera 
2880 4 Bought for my wife she absolutely loves it more then anything she said best bday present ever 
2881 2 I have a large tripod. The triangle slot that is used to set the tray on the tripod is too small, meaning the tray is too high off the ground, or I have to reduce the spread on the tripod. 
2882 4 Works well with think tank bags. Great purchase! 
2883 3 bought 2 of these and worked fine ran on a 9v 400ma ac/dc converter one chip lost the blue lighting but the other works fine. 
2884 4 Just got back from a motorcycle trip. Several days in the rain and it held like iron. Very happy with this mount. 
2885 3 work as advertise 
2886 1 The worst part is that it is actually a really good monitor. with all the nobs and settings you can not turn off the volume. so basically you are stuck listening to what ever you are shooting. 
2887 4 I bought these to clean my hard to keep clean eyeglasses. The best cloths I have found for that purpose. They leave no streaks or residue. I also use them to clean my laptop computer screen. Excellent. 
2888 4 Fast delivery, product as described. Would do biz, again. 
2889 4 Great lights, easy to set up and AWESOME to use!! 
2890 4 Can t go wrong with this. Just toss it down somewhere in your picture and click on the gray when editing - all set. No fuss. No muss. 
2891 2 Good as backups. Do not last anywhere near as long as canon but still a good deal at this price. 
2892 4 Tray and buy,good to have more lights 
2893 4 Still learning how to use it but so far I m satisfied with the lens. It works very well and I m getting some great shots. 
2894 4 It worked great. 
2895 2 works ok sometimes the alarm goes off without any motion in its area have used the reset button several times 
2896 3 My manfrotto tripod fits in there great! 
2897 2 A little bit smaller than i imagend but works well,instruction manual not verry helpful 
2898 4 Fast delivery and really easy set up!!! Sure wish I had read how many megapix the Camara I Vaught had but other than that easy set up!! 
2899 4 an amazing camera!!! 
2900 4 Just as described. 
2901 2 I have seen better that cost less more and perform constantly better. 
2902 4 Works great 
2903 4 Awesome little camera. Thinking about getting some more. 
2904 2 it s kind of small for what I needed, but it s fine 
2905 4 Perfect fit for my Canon Power Shot. 
2906 2 It is a good camera....However very difficult to setup through your mobile phone or see on a PC not connected to your wifi. You have to be an expert geek to do that. 
2907 4 I only want to say that I just love this product .I am really impressed by this awesome product.thanks for this 
2908 4 Couldn t be happier with this seller. Everything as expected plus some. True customer service the way that shows the seller values and appreciate the buyer. Kudos! 
2909 4 Came with everything just like it said. In case your wondering, you can clip all of this to your phone. I had that concern myself. Thanks for the awesome product! :) 
2910 4 Fit perfectly! 
2911 3 Great product, esp. for beginners like myself. However it did not come with instructions on how to set up. 
2912 4 It s great having an extra battery for long trips and extended shooting and editing. 
2913 4 works great 
2914 4 Works like the original equipment 
2915 4 Great camera with lots of features great price, great pictures, great optics. 
2916 3 its great prodcut easy to install already comes programmed. Hands down best DIY product for any property owner / renter, 
2917 0 Bought this for my desk at work. It s terrible! It loops from the SD card to the generic pictures and then continues with the generic pictures. I have to turn on the SD card at least twice a day. Terrible! 
2918 3 The Adapter fullfilled my need well. I just did not expect the extra size &#34;adaptors&#34;. 
2919 4 Great battery charger for my Nikon Coolpix L830...no more frustrating dead battery worries! 
2920 3 Other than the fact that you have to buy a memory card separate we like it! I thought that would be included in the bundle, or even with just the camera, but it s not. The camera is great! 
2921 4 outstanding design for low cost (a very reasonable cost) work right out of the box. easy of setting it up. Best part is no monthly payment like Dropcam. Will buy several more. 
2922 4 Great products! 
2923 3 Worked great on our Disneyland trip. Fit right in the backpack, that way we didn t need to carry around the big camera case. 
2924 1 Does not fit well 
2925 4 Fantastic and it looks great too. 
2926 4 perfect price and a good piece 
2927 4 Good job! 
2928 4 Great product, very realistic and easy to install. Highly recommend. Good through all weathers also. Batteries been in 6 months and the light still blinks 
2929 3 GREAT POINT AND SHOOT CAMERA!! 
2930 4 ottima borsa 
2931 0 When it stays on, it works well. Doesn t always stay on. I would turn it on before heading out for a paintball game, then after game find out it was off...or showing a buffering symbol...or whatever. Performance seems inconsistent. 
2932 0 I own this system and the hard drive took a crap on me just right out of 1 year... The DVR is junk loads slow ect Cameras are not bad though. I upgraded to the newest system plan on using these cameras with my new ones 
2933 4 Have these batteries for quite a while now. They are still doing their job. 
2934 4 Works as advertised and fits Hero 4 Silver. 
2935 4 It works great 
2936 3 good enough 
2937 4 Very fun to play with! Getting some really cool photos. 
2938 4 works really well. 
2939 4 It was i was expecting. 
2940 4 Perfect item, as described in photo, very fast shipping, thank you I live it :0) 
2941 3 Great price and batteries seem to hold charge so far. 
2942 3 Good 
2943 4 Great service, delivered precisely as stated. Thanks. 
2944 4 Was absolutely everything I thought it would be. Works perfectly for all my video recording and photography needs 
2945 0 The part that was supposed to screw into the camera, was not threaded. 
2946 4 Just awesome... It s a great lens with high quality pictures and fast shutter speed I love it. Amazon surprised me with one day advance delivery ... 
2947 4 Excellent 
2948 3 Item was as described. Item was great quality. Delivered quickly. Would have rated it as a 5 star but was too tight for Canon 100-400mm Zoom Lens shade. Lens fits fine. 
2949 4 Great for the price 
2950 3 Will advise if it really works, but I like the protection 
2951 4 Great tripod, smooth movements, easy to set up. I like the locking features and the slide on and off detachable plate for easy camera attachment 
2952 4 Love this lens hood. 
2953 1 Not a good camera but does barely adequate video. 
2954 4 Quality... 
2955 4 Amazing lens, happy with outcome of product !!!! 
2956 4 What a great deal. The batteries are really why I bought this and they are effect the other accessories are ok 
2957 2 Pros: Well made, Good price Cons: Wrong size (5.5 x 2.1 mm not 4.0 x 1.7) 
2958 4 It s a pretty amazing value for the price. Very satisfied. Arrived much sooner than estimated. I would recommend to everyone. 
2959 0 this is the worst piece of garbage I ever bought from amazon...if I had the box I would return it in a minute..no wonder it was a big sale...video sucks 
2960 4 Good 
2961 4 Really Good Camera, Takes a few minutes to understand how to operate it (i didn t look in the manual) but overall its pretty easy and very light. Takes about 5-10 seconds to the image to Appear on film. 
2962 4 Works really well in my D300. 
2963 4 Great! 
2964 4 Good price and it does the job ! I love having my lens caps right where I need them ! 
2965 1 This lens hood was fine for a while, but started to tear and was not usable. Also, fully extended, the lens hood showed up in the pictures and had to be cropped out. 
2966 4 Excellente, simple product give nice result. 
2967 4 Awesome! Love it! 
2968 4 fits my camera nicely 
2969 3 Not bad...! 😁 
2970 4 Does just what it should. 
2971 4 Exceptionally well designed medium size camera bag at a reasonable price for a carrying: - camera attached to a 24-300mm lens with hood attached - lens and flash -second camera in top compartment 
2972 0 It was not for the battery model described above! 
2973 3 good product. a little hard to close (as these styles are) even with their very clear video, but i got it. The carrying case doesnt have a carrying strap, which would have been nice. 
2974 4 Gets job done! 
2975 0 Had to return - would not work wirelessly. Support spent 2 hours with me and ended up telling me to return. 
2976 3 Pretty good so far, I will see how it goes. 
2977 4 Excellent quality. CASE LOGIC sells very good products. I really appreciate having a camera case that can withstand rough treatment and protect my cameras and lenses. 
2978 4 received promptly..... it s now charged up and ready to use 
2979 4 Awesome! Just get a cheap 1TB USB drive and you are good-to-go! Works perfectly! 
2980 4 This works like magic! My wife loved it! 
2981 4 Perfect for the nikon j4, camera lens and accessories Absolutely love it. Well made, too. 
2982 4 Best camera ever had. 
2983 4 Works well and reasonably priced. 
2984 4 Super product Excellent service. 
2985 4 Very nice pack for the price! I have used it heavily over the last couple of weeks. 
2986 3 fits, and looks good. missing a couple of holes for some openings that you might not need while using the camera. but to get to all the camera slots, you ll have to take the entire case off. makes this camera look like a really expensive good camera. 
2987 4 Works great and made of quality material. The only thing that I don t like it no identifying mark on the top. When you open the case and have loose items in the large hole they fall out. 
2988 1 only one of the two batteries actually works 
2989 4 Everything that is represented in this package came in perfect condition! 
2990 3 I received the battery quickly and was exactly as I expected. The price was very competitive. I had just bought a new camera and the camera battery was dead. I guess that the way it is, so I was surprised that this battery was fully charged. 
2991 0 Supports old browser versions (Chrome/IE latest version on Windows 7/8 didn t work) and operating systems (XP, maybe). Couldn t find mobile app either on Android app store. 
2992 0 The panasonic lens aproved by Blackmagic simply stopped focusing. it is blocked. Is the the problem in the Panansonic Lens or in the Camera ? 
2993 2 It worked as we have hoped- waterproof. You need to stay still a little longer when you take the picture..., the flash light takes a little longer than other cameras if you need it for picture taking. 
2994 4 as i coach i love this thing, only thing i do not like is that there is no display but I use my ipad for that. 
2995 4 A good little camera for the money. Still figuring out all the bells and whistles. Wanted it for baseball and football games. Truly can not go wrong with a Canon camera and this lives up to there reputation. 
2996 4 Easy to install,works as advertised,no false alarms but did alarm when a flock of doves flew through the beams. 
2997 4 Good product 
2998 4 good all around camera 
2999 4 Excellent 
3000 4 Wow! I really like this camera bag. I managed to fit a Canon 7D with battery pack, a speedlite, 70-210 and 28-80mm lenses and a few other miscellaneous items inside. 
3001 4 This is a great case! I love it, it s made my instax much more easily portable - i always have it around my neck :) 
3002 4 Good Battery. Thank you. 
3003 3 it s alright 
3004 4 Can t use my camera without this... 
3005 4 Good POUCH.... 
3006 4 Package arrived on time. Lens was in new condition with no defects. Works great. 
3007 4 Love this camera!!! It connects great to our iPhone and that feature has come in very handy!!!! 
3008 4 Awesome and quick delivery! 
3009 4 GREAT 
3010 4 Great lens, sharp and just what I was looking for. 
3011 0 Worked for one hour..then died. 
3012 2 This Drone isn t even a beginner drone. This drone is the worst I ve ever bought. Don t get fooled. Peace 
3013 3 Everything is pretty easy, except installing the micro SD card. You need to use the round end of a paper-clip to push the card all the way in until it locks. 
3014 4 Great price for a back up battery. They charged up like my original Canon and so far I am having good success with them. 
3015 4 it is light, stable and easy to use 
3016 3 Good product! 😊 
3017 4 thank you Henry Campbell 
3018 4 Excellent camera I love this camera I give it a 5 star 
3019 4 Great camera for everything I need it for 
3020 4 Great buy 
3021 4 Worked great with fast shipping. Did exactly what it was supposed to do. 
3022 4 Exactly what I was looking for 
3023 4 Excellent 
3024 4 Lots of room, and it fits behind our truck seat out of sight, lots of padding and protection. 
3025 2 Great deal, the only issue I have is there s a glare when you use it so it s very hard to see the screen when it s applied 😔 Other than that good product!! 
3026 4 I was thrilled to find a replacement for my old workhorse 880 And was surorised to also get a carry case, and charger. Now my Wide angle lens will not go to waste. 
3027 4 Really good! 
3028 4 So soft and comfortable on my neck. I ll have to order another with a different design. I love this. 
3029 2 Not easy to use. I have only been able to see the moon and across the lake where I live. Stars and planets are too hard to find and the auto finder has not yet found one. 
3030 0 Fast shipped with it but the product was not built for my Samsung Galaxy EK-GC200 as described. The alignment and holes not correct disappointed for sure 
3031 4 fits most 4x4 filters 
3032 4 Interchangeable with the original battery in my Panasonic camera. I always want a spare when traveling. Usually try to alternate them. 
3033 4 Fantastic! Very happy with sling. 
3034 4 First one had an issue with the HDMI port they made it right highly recommend 
3035 4 the camera is working very well. Reasonably easy to install (if you know what you are doing). 
3036 4 Exactly what I was looking for 
3037 3 good item 
3038 0 The plastic cracked while putting it on my iPhone5 the first try, so i had to return it. I did try a few shots and they weren t anything special. 
3039 4 prfect 
3040 4 Fits great. 
3041 4 Love this bag... Perfect size. 
3042 3 Great straps to carry a med-large tripod when in the field. More convenient than the regular case. 
3043 3 I like it and am enjoying it for the purpose I bought this for... I ll be back for more, it works amazingly well! 
3044 3 very easy to use. thankful for the item. Just as posted. 
3045 4 Very smooth and great value. Make sure you have the right base on your tripod so you get the correct size dolly. 
3046 4 Love these lights. I only wish it had come with assembly instructions. (We did figure it out, eventually). 
3047 4 works great. 
3048 4 This product is just what I wanted for my camera , it comes very handy and versatile. 
3049 0 Video image is worse I ve seen. Blurr and out of Focuss. Really felt cheated. 
3050 3 Works well, the only problem is seeing the wording on the screen, have to use a small flashlight, that stops me from giving it the fifth star... 
3051 4 Fantastic!!!.. 
3052 4 I received it much faster than I expected and it works better than the original. 
3053 3 I like this EP, bright and wide viewing field. Edge to edge sharpness is not perfect however, it s about 70~80% sharp from center. 
3054 4 Works fine 
3055 4 Great light, very portable. Love the ability to dim the light also. 
3056 3 Love this camera. Support was also very helpful when it wouldn t connect to my WiFi. Not connecting was it s only issue. Now works perfectly. 
3057 3 This strap was more comfortable to wear with the binoculars I bought. 
3058 4 Great Battery ... So far it perform as good as the original ... highly recommended 
3059 4 excellent! 
3060 1 Image is ok Smartphone works ok Cannot upgrade firmware Image don t show at PC software No website information 
3061 4 Quickly delivery. Brought mainly for the chest mount and head mount which I m very happy with both work well. All other accessories seem pretty decent, will have to use at some point. 
3062 4 5+++ great people to deal with 
3063 4 This thing is amazing!! Quality is spot on, you can t beat this thing at the price point or even higher. Get yourself one you won t regret it!! 
3064 4 It fits my gopro hero 3 just fine. I bought it so I can use the gopro without a battery and house power connected to it when I use it as baby monitor. 
3065 2 It s okay. Not a great product 
3066 4 Has some good wind power for cleaning your optics - lenses, camera sensors, inside computers. Nice and simple - no supplies needed. 
3067 0 It works, before it breaks. After a few years, now all of the plastic pieces on this monopod are broken. For what reason should I ever buy Manfrotto again? 
3068 4 Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to. 
3069 4 Great camera! I have not owned many cameras but this one will last me a very long time. Once I can start getting new lenses I will love it even more. Definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a unique but powerful camera. 
3070 4 Works great on my camera. 
3071 4 nice 
3072 4 Perfect fit for my camera and its charger and a few SD cards. 
3073 4 very good 
3074 4 Great product 
3075 3 Stain on filter when it came. The MagicFiber cloth turns out very useful to remove it. I guess the filter is good for its price, but definitely not using it &#34;full time&#34; due to the visible reflections and lens flare in many situations. 
3076 4 So far the Yongnuo YN-622N controller and transceivers working flawlessly on both a Nikon D610 and D810. 
3077 4 no issues. I love this camera. it works for me as advertised. 
3078 4 Great camera. Very suitable for my needs and takes great pictures. 
3079 4 Bought this for my Husband and he loved it! Very nice product and a really quick delivery. Would definitely buy from thus company again! 
3080 2 It is OK for a quick camera 
3081 3 Very impressed. Easy to use. Like that it s not Bluetooth. Don t have to worry about being charged! 
3082 3 Ok 
3083 4 Awesome product 
3084 4 Danny was great, he fixed everything and was very nice! Good product!! 
3085 4 Works great. We use these to monitor our pets when we re away. 
3086 3 It s great but I bought the prime day bundle so not all accesories fits on it so not perfect for my purchase. 
3087 2 The eyepieces are good quality. iTs a nice set. BUT THE CASE THAT YOU GET IS NOT THE ONE DISPLAYED. You get a black case instead of the brushed aluminum. AMAZON, PLEASE SHOW THE CORRECT CASE!!!!!! 
3088 3 Nice item, well made. 
3089 4 My most used lens, especially for HDR photography. I keep forgetting to turn off the image stabilizer when done shooting. See my work on Panoramio. 
3090 4 Delivered on time and as per description 
3091 3 very good product. excellent quality 
3092 4 I am very pleased with this product. I have a Nikon D3300 and it works beautifully with it. 
3093 4 excellent frame. 
3094 3 Hard to focus does not take good close up pictures or wide angle seems off but at full telephoto it is better than average 
3095 2 The edges of the material started to fray after two months. 
3096 3 Never have to worry about a dead battery. Speedy delivery 
3097 3 Batteries work as described. Great price on these. 
3098 0 didn t zoom in on gopro 
3099 4 Solid, awesome Pelican case as are all the Pelican cases I own! 
3100 4 great grip. 
3101 4 Love it. Great pics and no lens moving in and out. 
3102 4 Just as advertised. Great lens protectors. 
3103 0 Protection plans are stupid in general 
3104 4 Great little bag, holds a lot and its well made. 
3105 4 I like it 
3106 4 Battery was as expected.. Working great 
3107 4 No Problems here. Seems to be a good product. 
3108 3 I would give it a 5 stars if not for the fact that I have to have a tools in order to use it properly. I mean, the D part of the screw (the part we handle) is too small to twist. Other than that, the product is good. 
3109 4 Works great, no problems can have fresh battery handy when shooting a lot of photos. 
3110 4 Takes such amazing photos!!! (but i have not been able to find a B&W setting...) 
3111 4 great 
3112 4 Worked great No problems 
3113 1 It works but is a little &#34;twitchy&#34; in that it doesn t always want to work properly. 
3114 4 If you buy a Canon Vixia HF R600, you will not run out of battery with this purchase. A definite must buy. 
3115 4 Works perfectly! 
3116 4 Nice and neat for my go pro 
3117 4 It works perfect. 
3118 4 LOVE this purchase. I ve used it for multi 5ks, bike rides with the family, basically any experience I want to capture POV - to many to list. Sturdy product, not to heavy or clunky. Thumbs up!! 
3119 4 It works ! 
3120 2 Works well, no problems with the mounting brackets or anything. Does get uncomfortable after a little while, but if you re wearing anything more than a t-shirt you do not feel it. Enjoy the flexibility in size. 
3121 3 Seems to be holding up in water tests (without the camera in it). Does as advertised so far. 
3122 4 Great lens. I love it! 
3123 4 Strong clips for the price! 
3124 4 Better and cheaper than go pro! 
3125 4 good...... 
3126 4 Exactly what I needed. 
3127 4 Awesome 
3128 4 Work as described 
3129 4 Very compact and easy to use. These have enhanced many shots for me! Was a little puzzling how to twist them back into the carrying case, but once I figured it out, it is VERY SIMPLE! 
3130 3 Great value for the price 
3131 4 Well made. 
3132 3 Sound quality isn t the best and the battery only lasts for a couple hours, but they are still amazing to have 
3133 4 Great productos good quality and fits my camera perfectly. 
3134 4 it was fine 
3135 4 really surprising 
3136 4 I have a canon SL1 and works great; easy to use. 
3137 4 Easy to install and use for magnifying the surface of objects. Good magnification. Excellent value for the price. 
3138 4 I really like this. It s really cute. 
3139 4 Excellent! 
3140 4 Took a spill with my Inspire 1 and tore this cable. This is a perfect replacement. 
3141 4 Quick delivery- part was right 
3142 4 This case is awesome. Love it. Works great with my camera. Worth the money 
3143 4 excellent quality, and after 6 months it works perfectly 
3144 4 All OK.. 
3145 2 Pretty average camera, but it works 
3146 3 I can t say whether the battery life is as long as the factory GoPro batteries, as I haven t done a side by side test. But I ve used these batteries in the camera and so far so good. 
3147 4 Perfect works great !! 
3148 4 Works perfect for my camera 
3149 4 Excellent lens for long distance, fully manual lens, 
3150 4 Awesome deal, thanks 
3151 4 Purchased this for a Tokina 11-16mm f/2.8. It s always better to break a 10$ piece of glass than it is to break a 500$ lens. Buy this for your lens. 
3152 4 Very good! 
3153 4 Great lens. Works great for family photos and photoshoots. 
3154 0 Worked great for the first couple of times, then it just stopped workin, only works when I have it charges 
3155 4 Great camera. Shoots great video. Highly recommended 
3156 4 Great product, really impressive customer service! 
3157 4 No issues so far. Haven t used it much yet. 
3158 4 Works well 
3159 2 They re nice but they re slightly bigger than the Instax Mini 8 films. 
3160 0 Cannot get them to work. Only works with Outdated web Browser 
3161 3 Worked fine for the camera, but figuring out how to attach it with the straps needs instructions. 
3162 4 Item as described, great product. 
3163 4 Husband has set it up in his car and kept himself busy for hours with this thing. As long as he s playing with the camera and the car, he s not buggin me! 
3164 4 Bought it for working on micro soldering, its ok but one axis is reversed without special software. Kids love to play with it and check out all kinds of stuff. 
3165 4 Good quality, very useful, practical and stylish camera backpack! 
3166 4 Awesome camera...video is clear, easy setup. I have 2, and I would definitely recommend. 
3167 4 Sturdy and VERY LIGHT! 
3168 0 It is not what I expected, I was hoping it was made of a stronger material. 
3169 0 Sucks....Can t see clearly at night and it also overheats the camera. FAIL 
3170 4 GOOD COMMERCIAL APPLICATION 
3171 4 Excellent quality 
3172 2 Wish I would have gotten one that can take photos with a button at the stem 
3173 3 Just what I was looking for. Is worth the 4 stars. Super quality also. Just as stated. As good if not better then items that cost more. Well worth the money. Have no real con s at this time and do not dee any in the future. 
3174 3 Great for crafts, the photos can come out darker but overall love this tiny printer. 
3175 4 Wonderful for the price 
3176 4 Had a client inadvertently run cat5e instead of siamese cable. These saved us from having to spend two days re-running cables 70 in the air across the top of a factory floor. Works perfect! 
3177 1 The pictures all look hazy blue. What I was seeing was more colorful than the pictures. Sending back 
3178 4 Came with everything I needed. As a professional, I appreciate the quick delivery and excellent care in wrapping. Worked great right out of the box. 
3179 4 fast deliver and good product 
3180 4 Returned because Fuji S4800 failed.. 
3181 2 Quality of leather was below my expectation. 
3182 1 Alright for walking, but not jarring action. 
3183 4 I ve had this case for at least 8 years and I ve used it in many different countries. My deepest dive with it was 125 ft and its never leaked. The buttons are easy to use and you get great pic s 
3184 4 Nice photo frame, works well. Clear picture. Easy to use. 
3185 3 i like it, but the carrying case is not the one in the picture. 
3186 3 Best Polaroid film I ve bought in 3 years! I buy it every year for the first day of school photos to use all year...thank you, you took very good care of the film...Janet 
3187 4 Fits perfectly 
3188 4 Excellent shipping 8ng and item 
3189 4 The best glasses cleaners i have ever had. While each cloth is small, the results after use are excellent. A true first class product, i will definatly be ordering more. 
3190 4 Great deal, batteries and charger work well with my cannon. 
3191 4 These are great battery. They last longer than I expected, and they stay cool and not heat up as my previous one. 
3192 4 works well, and very good advice 
3193 3 Does what it says it will. 
3194 4 a very fine and honest dealer 
3195 1 Disappointed no memory card included 
3196 4 These stick on great I just use my hand to get the dirt off. These are easy to use and are cheaper than any other options. Even if I m not AIing a cow I use them to see when my bull is breeding. 
3197 4 A-OK 
3198 4 as advertised 
3199 0 I bought this product and till now I could not use it because it didn t work, I contact the support and they were unhelpful I m using it right know as a mouse pad 
3200 1 Wifi switch broke after a few days. Great camera and water proof case. 
3201 2 Doesn t quite work, stick withy thame original 
3202 4 Perfect for my tiny Canon camera and charger. 
3203 4 Excellent value! Polarizing lens makes outstanding pictures of glaciers and waterfalls! 
3204 0 Was not as expected! Returned! 
3205 4 leave the blinking LED off. real camera s do not blink. 
3206 3 Used it for a trip to Europe. Was perfect for what I needed. Compact but plenty of storage. Camera with lens, plus two additional lenses, accessories and an ipad. All fit perfectly. 
3207 4 Good camera 
3208 4 Just started my online business and the product MS20 is helping me achieve great images. Very simple and easy to build and use. 
3209 4 Although I haven t graduated off &#34;Auto&#34; on my K-50, I took some pics through the window of a moving automobile, and they came out Postcard Perfect! Unbelievable--I am impressed! 
3210 4 Great addition to my everyday out and about photo bag. 
3211 4 OEM and perfect. Obviously there are cheaper but I m a stickler for consistency. 8-) 
3212 3 Great starter kit though I wish there was longer battery life 
3213 4 This OEM battery holder seems very sturdy as it has more metal than the cheaper variety. This holder is worth the money but I would not discount the cheaper ones. I also have one but feel that its life-span would not be as long since it is practically all plastic. 
3214 0 Piece of crap instructions confusing no help never got it to work sim card still stuck in it a waste of my time and money. 
3215 3 Work well with connection being tight and secure. Female end a little big hard to hide but with a little finagling all is good 
3216 4 Perfect design: Absolute functional and gorgeous. Perfect handcraft: Every details are fully considered and covered. The little base might look easy and simple but it involves a lot works and focus. Perfect service: Quick delivery,peace of mind after-sale service! J.B.Camera Designs add extra rejoicing on my photograph! Well done! 
3217 4 It s been almost 2.5 years since I bought this strap and it was a great purchase. It s nicely padded and I love the versatility the clip system allows for. A comfy strap is a must for using heavy glass 
3218 0 Save time and frustration...get the original Samsung Battery as a back up. Mine did not hold a full charge...even when charged overnight. Thought I could save a few bucks. Promptly returned for the real thing. 
3219 4 I works well with Canon 5Dii and plus, the three batteries it uses are AAA and are easily available. 
3220 3 good 
3221 4 it does everything i want and is very compact 
3222 3 Camera is great! Some of the extras have limited use. 
3223 2 Drone worked great, but had a problem with the camera. Various lines and snow. Otherwise no problems. 
3224 0 My old camera case is better than this one. 
3225 4 Love it. 
3226 4 I love this frame. I have purchased three over the years. Size is nice. And it has been a great gift for my family...I can easily send the grandparents pictures of the family and it will automatically upload to their frame. 
3227 1 Flimsy and detaches from frame easily. 
3228 4 Really nice for the money.... 
3229 4 Great product, alarm up and working again 
3230 3 Cheaply made. works good 
3231 0 Plastic snapped off, weak for larger phones, I have an LG G3 
3232 4 As advertised 
3233 4 Works perfect 
3234 4 Great item 
3235 4 Excelente 
3236 0 Awful Shoulder strap. Every time you raise the camera quickly, the strap gets tangled in the D ring. This makes the product useless as it prevents a quick draw. Bought a Cotton Carrier and never looked back. 
3237 4 This camera is simply amazing. I just returned from a week in Cozumel where I took over 800 UW pics with the camera at depths ranging from surface to 105 feet. The pictures are amazing. I highly recommend this camera. 
3238 2 It doesn t have a motion sensor as it said so it is useless for what I needed it for. Otherwise it s fun to play with. 
3239 4 excellent 
3240 1 It works but just not great I the they hyped the product a little much 
3241 1 Easy to install. I had one camera stop working after 6 months. 
3242 4 This product is worth the extra money 
3243 4 worked as advertised 
3244 4 Great Product! 
3245 4 I love this camera and enjoy taking pictures with it. 
3246 4 Great batteries, lasts over an hour with wifi remote on. 
3247 4 Don t go in the water without it. 
3248 4 good condition & great price 
3249 4 Excellent product. 
3250 4 What a great deal! Got everything I needed for my camera & more! Had no issues whatsoever! Highly recommended! 
3251 4 Good solid fit. Protects the camera well. It is a little bulky to hang on my belt. I can fit exta battery and SD cards in the front pocket. 
3252 2 not bad, good protection 
3253 4 Thank you John, for being so helpful in setting up my camera. I m not very camera smart, but this was the easiest setup I could ever imagine. I highly recommend FOSCAM F18919W, and there team support, especially John. Thank you once again. 
3254 4 Light and sturdy tripod works wonders when you are traveling or hiking with itit. This is one of those tripods. This product is well worth the money. My brother bought it. 
3255 4 Works great programmed into my Veralite system. I am very happy. 
3256 4 Works excellent, good quality 
3257 0 Unfortunately, I couldn t get it to work :( 
3258 1 too small 
3259 4 Arrived earlier than expected. Cannot wait to use it :3 
3260 4 Great camera pic up several for family and friends. 
3261 3 Works well on its own; bought it to add to my Staples Connect system which it does however audio is not currently supported via Connect. Product has a fairly good image compared to my multiple FOSCAMs. 
3262 4 Works perfectly and the charge lasts longer than expected. 
3263 3 Work really well but do not hold a charge as long as the Canon batteries. but, well worth the price. 
3264 0 sent back. the eye doc gives bigger cloths than these/The size of a postage stamp!!! 
3265 4 Very good with this price. 
3266 4 good price and product. 
3267 4 Amazing 
3268 4 Bought this back in 2013 but thought I d still do a review: I use this bag for my Samsung NX1000 and it fits everything. Very spacious and easy to carry and like that it has lots of pockets. 
3269 4 The brush quality and the size of the blower was bigger than I expected it to be. I ordered the version with the Altura lens cleaner included. I used it on a really filthy telescope eyepiece (with multi-coatings) to no obvious ill effect, so that s good. 
3270 4 Replacement lens works great, and fits like a glove! 
3271 4 Nice pouch. Filters fit snugly and padding was good. Folds nicely. 
3272 4 Lens captures nice crisp shots. Takes the place of original D40 lens and separate 200mm lens. 
3273 4 Great - just as described & prompt delivery. 
3274 4 It s a very wide lens for a cctv camera. It s the widest I ve purchased thus far. Picture quality isn t great but it is acceptable. I can see my entire living room which we never thought would be possible with one camera. 
3275 3 Works 
3276 4 Works great. Would buy again. 
3277 4 great deal on a great camera. arrived promptly. 
3278 4 Wonderfull battery 
3279 4 This light is bright and a great value! 
3280 1 It s not so great for outdoors :( I hate it. 
3281 4 Works great for kids toys that need batteries. Great price! 
3282 3 Great picture. Touch screen has not panned out yet, but still worth the buy for my CCTV. 
3283 0 Piece of junk, its the right plug but it won t go into my camera 
3284 4 Very well built. Straight and solid. A bit heavy, but that s the advantage, it s a solid foundation for multiple cameras. 
3285 3 basic follow focus, 4 stars as i knew it wasn t going to be great, so as a cheap easy one, sure its a great one. if you want perfect smooth no feeling of the gears when turning, buy a better quality one. 
3286 4 This comes with all the hardware. it works for distance and close up photography. My only problem is that I haven t found a recharble battery for the flash. 
3287 3 Works great, just like all other GoPro products. Would have liked more curved mounts for helmets. This package includes 3 curved and 3 flat. Would like to be able to purchase all curved or all flat. 
3288 3 Purchased this kit, because I lost my other charger and battery. And this one did the job to keep me using my Olympus digital camera. 
3289 3 Good quality product! 
3290 4 Excellent lightweight tripod 
3291 2 Good and solid quality but too big for my small EOS Rebel SL1. Not an appropriate size for people to carry, in my opinion. 
3292 4 these work great on my husbands camera lenses. very compact! 
3293 4 Great value for a great product. I bought this as a gift for my wife and was pleasantly surprised by the performance, especially for the price. 
3294 3 Arrived on time and works as advertised. No problems. A good replacement hood and lens cap for video cameras. A little overpriced. But good. 
3295 3 I have no idea how this will perform over the long run, hence the four stars, but for now it s performing flawlessly. 
3296 2 They work very well but the seT up is confusing. I still am having trouble understanding the logging and replay of the history you need to be a very savvy tech person and a couple of hrs to set it up. 
3297 4 An improved version of the Plume Wafer w/o the cost. I have 2 of them. Great construction! The reflective surface near the center of my Plume came apart after years of use. This looks like it will last a lot longer. 
3298 4 Great to start with!! Controls are easy to figure and handle!! Unit is durable but lightweight so wind is an issue 
3299 4 System works great. Dollar for dollar very good value. 
3300 4 Showed up on time, works exactly as advertised. Also came with a car-charger cable, which is an added bonus. 
3301 4 good value quick delivery 
3302 4 Fits my camera perfectly! Love this case! I use it all the time. The material is soft to the touch. I don t use the strap it came with as I wanted a &#34;prettier&#34; one. 
3303 4 the best I ve ever had. no wires. can go as far as 10 feet. 
3304 4 LOve it 
3305 4 Absolutely entirely what I was looking for! 
3306 4 Exactly what I was looking for 
3307 4 I lost my original case that came with my Canon camera This one was an exact replacement, and i love it. The quality is excellent. 
3308 3 Lightweight, no binding or slipping, holds tightly to all my filters and lenses. Would be nice if the edge were knurled, hence four stars. 
3309 0 Very disappointed. 
3310 4 These Camera s are awesome! Can t tell that they re fake!! 
3311 4 Awesome lens for the a6000! You would NOT regret buying this lens. NO lens creep, plenty bright in most situations and a great WIDE focal range! 
3312 4 Great! 
3313 4 I haven t turned it off since I got it! I think it can do way more than I needed but am very happy I purchased it! 
3314 4 Great 
3315 3 seem to work 
3316 4 Pros: - 75-300mm telephoto zoom lens with f/4-5.6 maximum aperture for Canon SLR cameras - Improved mechanism makes zooming smoother; front part of zoom ring sports silver ring - Measures 2.8 inches in diameter and 4.8 inches long; weighs 16.8 ounces 
3317 4 Great!! My daughter absolutely loves it!! 
3318 3 Work and fit just as well as the original. 
3319 4 Its hard to go wrong with a sling strap and this was a far better deal than the straps at my local stores, it works great and its my favorite strap now 
3320 0 Not what i expected. 
3321 4 Outstanding. Works great on my Meade LX200GPS 12&#34; telescope. Good construction, I hope. 
3322 4 Item as described 
3323 1 Hood needs to fix. 
3324 4 kenneth. Took a while with the plugin issues but Kenneth stayed with it until the problem was solved. 
3325 1 Too tight 
3326 3 now my husband can capture everything on his GoPro. EVERYTHING. great.... 
3327 3 No manual to explain things so I had to figure it out by myself, but the grip works well and I really appreciate all of the features. 
3328 0 does not compatible with 5DS-R. 
3329 4 Good camera for the price. 
3330 4 Work great and a good price. 
3331 4 Great size for a body with attached lens, a second lens, flash and spare battery. I even made a little slot to carry my extra CF cards. 
3332 4 Very nice!! 
3333 4 The camera works as advertised. It it works seamlessly with Apple s forthcoming Apple TV/HomeKit system, I will purchase a lot more of them. 
3334 4 This camera is easy to use. This is my second one I purchased because my husband liked mine so much he wanted his own 
3335 4 Great for my Nikon D-90. Good low light. Light weight. If you don t mind zooming with your feet. 
3336 4 Great deal. charger works well and batteries hold a charge like the original gopro batteries. Awesome price! 
3337 4 Good stuff! 
3338 4 Works great. I have a Nikon D300 that uses CF. My mac easily takes SD. So, this is a good and easy way to take photos and transfer them to mac (and most other devices). No issues so far. 
3339 4 Fast shipping & great price - just wish it wasn t so pricey & hard to get them developed when done ! 
3340 3 For the price it has met my expectations. Been using it an all works good. Video quality is high and the pictures come out good also. So far so good, no complaints! 
3341 4 great 
3342 0 Not an actual Nikon product, the rubber was not the same material as the original and if fell apart while removing it from the package. Shipped from China, surprisingly fast but it s junk. Hardly any glue holding the rubber eye piece to the plastic &#34;frame&#34;. 
3343 1 Foggy picture. 
3344 4 Great piece of plastic, it s worth it. I ve gotten plenty of reat shots with this lens 
3345 4 Love it so far... would be nice to have a packing slip in the box. 
3346 0 My batteries fried in it.. used it once and battery acid went every where. Thought maybe it was bad batteries but then it happened with the next ones i put in too 
3347 4 Great thing 
3348 4 My son uses it for his mountain bike races. Works great. 
3349 4 Excellent quality cable. They were exactly as described and arrived as schedules. Excellent experience. 
3350 4 Great device! easy to use. 
3351 4 works as expected 
3352 4 Very quick service and exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!! 
3353 2 Easy to configure, two way audio not very good, motion detection not good excellent for the price. 
3354 4 Works as advertised. Now you don t have to set up the camera with the self-timer and try to run to get in the picture. Just point this little device at your Nikon, and trip the shutter from afar. 
3355 4 Its a very neat product. Its strong enough to hold the smartphone. As Bluetooth unit is an independent piece, it helps to click from the hand which is not holding the stick and thus avoiding any shaking of the stick. 
3356 4 I m so pleased with the product and the speedily delivery! Great doing business with, I highly recommend! 
3357 4 Sturdy and Stead 
3358 4 Great product 
3359 4 Great little tripod that is surprisingly sturdy for the size and price. Folds up nicely into a little carrier. Recommend. 
3360 4 A very useful add-on for the stabilizer. You can easily get amazing angles with high and low. The length is very easy to adjust. And even if you don t need an extension, the added length helps keep the entire setup smoother. 
3361 4 Got it on time for my niece birthday she love some how I thought that the film came with the camera cause in the picture the film is next to the camera but it did not sad but true but still I will give it a 5 star 
3362 3 It works very good to take pictures and video 
3363 4 very helpful- handy 
3364 0 After getting the SD Card that it didn t come with, the picture quality was total crap. worthless 
3365 3 I wish it didn t have the pre-cut slots for things to go. You could fit a lot more if it was like a rifle case. 
3366 4 Fit and worked great. The price fit perfectly as well! 
3367 4 Great charger, great battery s, specially for the price!! 
3368 4 Sweeeeeeet 
3369 4 Wow, easy set up. Got here on time with no damages. And I ll be ordering another for next year as a 2nd set-up. I highly recommend this product. 
3370 4 Pretty decent package overall, everything worked and definitely exceeded expectations. As a photo student this is perfect for what I need as well as my career! 
3371 4 Excellent !! 
3372 4 Its really good 
3373 4 Great set I love it 
3374 4 This was a great buy with many accessories included. They all work well with our gopro hero silver. 
3375 1 This broke within days of using it. 
3376 0 Does not fit the camera 
3377 3 I actually bought this as a gift for my three year old. Only down side is it does not make the shuter sound when you take a photo, so it is difficult to tell if your photo actually took 
3378 4 These batteries work great in my Canon camera and charge quickly. They were priced much lower than any of the other batteries. 
3379 4 They re perfect and a lot less that Canon 
3380 1 it s a good system. However, I wish it wasn t complicated to connect to your wireless device such as download Skype set up two different Skype accounts in order to view live on your wireless devices 
3381 4 Bag was a perfect fit for my G11 camera. Also has an extra slot inside to put things like extra memory cards or driver license and credit cards for easy travel. 
3382 4 For the price, these things exceeded my expectations. Highly recommend for either day or night 
3383 0 Coke bottle optics 
3384 1 the battery does not fit in exactly as this is for multiple types of batteries. Consequently, my grandchild who uses it becomes frustrated at times. 
3385 4 Excellent purchase! 
3386 4 Works perfectly! Better than the OEM one. 
3387 4 Nice size for easy use. Much better than those you get with your average cleaning kit s which tend to be too small and make it easy to smudge what you just cleaned. 
3388 4 Great product! I love mine. 
3389 0 The adapter did physically join my EOS camera to a manual film lens but the focal point was way too short to be of any use to anyone. 
3390 1 Very disappointed that it did not have belt loop to allow it to be carried on my pants belt. It is simply a cover. 
3391 0 The service was very good, but the glasses doesn t work. 
3392 3 Great product. Easy to use and took great pictures. 
3393 4 Its the best rig , for only 40$ you have a excellent rig with some funtions 
3394 4 Awesome product for the price. Sturdy and reliable. Recommend this product! 
3395 4 Great!!! 
3396 4 Definitely recommend for the price!! Can t beat it! 
3397 4 Don t substitute and buy off-brand batteries. Go with the real deal. They fit the camera and work as advertised. 
3398 3 Works great. No issues 
3399 4 Have had camera for a while.. Changed router and couldn t connect WI-Fi. Called service and they had me up and running in a few minutes. Kudos to service dept. Love camera. 
3400 4 Great price and product. 
3401 4 thank you 
3402 4 Works better then the original 
3403 3 Had to replace a couple of rivets as they broke off. Otherwise a nice genuine goat leather bag for my camera equipment. 
3404 4 I ADORE this strap. I did a ton of research, as a photography college student I was getting so sore after a day of shooting. This strap has made a huge difference, I don t have a sore shoulder anymore and I feel it distributes the weight well. 
3405 0 No records goes to the battery being charged, it has given me too many problems 
3406 4 As good as the brand name battery at 1/5 the cost!! 
3407 4 Good battery!!!!! 
3408 0 not very good qaulity and i have great internet speed in my home. im a systems admin so no problem setting up. terrible camera all around 
3409 3 Products were as described 
3410 4 works perfectly 
3411 3 Keeps my camera and equipment safe and well packed. Great buy. 
3412 2 Good 
3413 1 For the price, eh. I d spend that much on a good coffee, but the quality just sucks. It &#34;works&#34; but the instructions are inaccurate, the thing has to be reset all the time and the image quality is terrible. If you want one of these, spend a little more. 
3414 4 Saved my phone from sinking to the bottom of the river when tubing. One of the smartest purchases I ever made! 
3415 2 It came with some defects.. the housing that is covering the transformer it took off and I had to use adhesive to attach it again.. 
3416 4 Good product 
3417 4 Excellent binoculars. Everyone in the family enjoyed them. 
3418 4 Really nice camera, 24 MP sensor lots of excellent features, particularly like the articulating screen. If you don t have antique lenses, it ll work fine for you. 
3419 0 I was quite disappointed; when the kit arrived the original package was opened, both brushes and cleaning liquid missing. The paper and micro fiber cleaning pad dirty and torn, in a state that I would not recommend using it on a optical devices. 
3420 3 Good product 
3421 4 So easy to use! Great inexpensive flash. 
3422 3 Nothing like the OEM product for the Canon gear. Price is the worst, but seems to recharge better and last longer then the 3rd party batteries 
3423 4 Awesome HD CCTV video, yeah HD, and you can watch from anywhere on your phone. 
3424 4 Great Product!!! fast Shipping!! 
3425 4 totally loved it...works beyond what I expected...great buy...worth it... 
3426 4 Excellent product - works great 
3427 4 Nikon is best and this filter too. 
3428 3 Great lens, love that I can get in close, but has a hard time focusing. I m thinking of selling it because I don t use it that much for weddings. 
3429 4 Every thing I expected at a very good price. Easy to read and understand instruction manual. 
3430 3 Nice pair of batteries. 
3431 4 Very good ty 
3432 4 Exactly what i needed. Thanks! 
3433 4 Good 
3434 4 I am very happy with the product. It serve its purpose quite well: I use it at home for guests, since it is not something very handy to carry around in trips. :-) 
3435 0 It only worked for 3 days. 
3436 0 Not really the shutter button didn t work. 
3437 1 I was not happy with the camera. Quality is so so. I am returning it and purchased the printer to work with my smartphone. 
3438 4 a gift for my grandson in college and he was pleased. He is studying film. 
3439 3 While I don t use either the blue or the yellow, the white one works great when you don t want to haul around off-camera lighting or you want to be more discreet than a big soft box. Easier than making your own or holding up a piece of paper. 
3440 4 This camera one of the best in the market , I will give 10 stars if I have money I will buy another one ,this some pictures I took from iPhone to show how nice is the control panel, 
3441 3 It s a light weight tripod and easy to set up. I wish the swiveling was smoother though. Good for taking pictures, not as good for taking video that is action oriented. 
3442 4 Feels very solid, but has a nice light weight to it. Works smoothly with the right weight balancing it. Really love this jib, I ll be using this a lot in my work. 
3443 4 Why do I keep losing these things? Not sure, but this is a great replacement. 
3444 0 no information came no direction just the syma came 
3445 4 Just what I needed. Thanks. 
3446 3 works well 
3447 0 Leaked. Resolution was OK but not great before that, now its full of water.... 
3448 4 Just love the bag - had to pruchase both colors! 
3449 3 All sorts of cheap plastic crap for your gopro. 
3450 4 I am really happy with this product. Easy to use easy to install. And works as advertised 
3451 4 Batteries seems to be made in china,but it works great. Best deal possible for the amount of money spent! 
3452 4 The price is very reasonable 
3453 4 love it 
3454 4 Excellent 
3455 3 Great Product will buy again. 
3456 4 Great gift 
3457 4 I either lost or never had a charger for this camera. It worked perfectly 
3458 2 At times it does look a a bit cheap, but it has the style I was going for and has proven relaible 
3459 4 You get a lot for the money with this camera. I ordered it for the price/quality/features. The features are very impressive at this price point. 
3460 4 Worked great for my Nikon battery that I can t find the charger for, and the replacement batteries work perfectly in the camera. 
3461 4 Camera came/delivered two days after I ordered it (the day between ordering and delivery was a Sunday too!) in great condition. Instructions came in English and several other languages, along with helpful pictures to show how to operate the camera without much reading required. 
3462 3 seems to work alright 
3463 4 Great product. Uses very low current. Very easy to install. Just connect to the siren terminals.sound is loud enough and strobe is OK but not like a Police cruiser. 
3464 4 all that i want 
3465 3 Excellent 
3466 4 Great service and prompt delivery! Thanks a bunch!! A+ 
3467 4 Great camera! 
3468 3 Great product. Lightning aquick shipment. 
3469 4 I see you!!! Now get the heck outta here before I call the police 
3470 2 it works 
3471 4 love it ! 
3472 4 These are really nice little connectors at a very good price! 
3473 4 It is light and cute I just hope they had different fabrics 
3474 4 Great low cost alternative some of the much more expensive shutter releases. I ve put this through its paces. It s held up well and has helped me shoot some of my best long exposure b 
3475 4 exactly as described, works perfectly, well machined and fits my tripod quick release plate. note: you can t tighten with allen key, either by hand or a coin. 
3476 4 Everything showed up in one shipment exactly as advertised. Very happy with my purchase and choice of retailer. 
3477 4 It makes viewing the night sky easygoing! Constellations are now easy to find and view. 
3478 1 didn t last very long :( 
3479 4 good 
3480 0 the flash lamp broke down after 3 days of use 
3481 4 Very light and easy to carry! good looking! 
3482 4 They re perfect for my glasses, iPad, and iPhone! It s nice to know that I can scatter these throughout my home and always have one available. Thank you 
3483 4 Works as advertised. Good product. My use is a high gain long distance receiver for my RV, and it works great. 
3484 3 Nice gels, but took a long time to get here (Chicago area). 
3485 0 This is crap. It was really hard to seat on my 5D Mark III and not accurate according to two other levels I tested it against. Is it possible to give this zero stars? 
3486 4 Very good 
3487 4 good. 
3488 4 Nice camera,easy to use,easy to carry 
3489 3 Haven t used it much but so far its really good. Need to practice more w/ it. 
3490 4 It was adverticed 
3491 4 awesome love it 
3492 4 Very fast shipping. Holds my camera and all lenses. 
3493 4 Worked fine. VHS C cassette fit and ran as expected in the VCR. Fast delivery. 
3494 3 a bit cheaply made, but it pretty much does the job, especially for the price. 
3495 4 Great beginner set-up. 
3496 3 The Pixel Vertax D15 battery grip for Nikon D7100 works well on D7200. It s to bad u can t put 2 batteries in the grip like the grip for my old D90 s 
3497 3 It sort of did the job but it was hardly the easiest, clearest product on the market. 
3498 4 I recommend, fast delivery. very good 
3499 3 Camera had good image quality compared for its price. Promised 60fps was not achieved on 720p resolution but apr. 48-50fps but it is still better than 30fps from ordinary webcams. Well worth its price. 
3500 4 Pretty cool softbox, look forward to using them shortly 
3501 2 This camera does not take very good pictures but it s not an expensive camera either. Pictures are grainy and the further away you are from the subject the more grainy they are. 
3502 4 Inexpensive and sounds great!!!!! 
3503 4 Good 
3504 4 excellent design 
3505 4 Solid case for air-travel with any kind of tools! Sturdy & Rugged! 
3506 4 important to protect the lens. 
3507 0 awful camera, doesn t include everything you need as well as just an awful camera I would highly recommend not buying it 
3508 2 It s ok in a pinch if you didn t have lens cleaner and tissue, however, it still leaves some residual smudges. If I had both, my preference would be the cleaner and tissue. 
3509 4 Fine 
3510 4 great 
3511 3 This is great. Out met my expectations. Delivery was on time. Would definitely buy from them again. 
3512 4 works great, good buy for the money 
3513 0 Very poor quality. Pictures are dark, sometimes scrambled, and strange signs are sometimes shown instead of pictures. I’ve always had good luck with Amazon, but these frames are definitely not as advertised. 
3514 4 Excellente Stick. Nothing else to say. EXCELLENT 
3515 4 Good dog watcher. May buy more 
3516 4 Great cameras and used daily! 
3517 4 Bought with the secondary battery unit, all works well! 
3518 4 Has held up well over the last few months, plenty of room, zippers work well. Good padding and several zippered pockets. Well made! 
3519 4 Perfect fit for fuji xt1 
3520 4 This was given to my daughter as a Christmas gift and she likes it very much. 
3521 4 I bought a camera second hand and the strap was missing. I ordered this as I like to carry a camera and don t want to keep fishing it out of a pocket or purse. The main strap is very comfortable and doesn t dig in to my wrist. 
3522 4 Iam glad to get the battery thanks 
3523 4 Very decent camera for what I needed to view. Also the price is great. I had to purchase an extra 150ft bnc cable for it to reach its location. Works great at night. Great buy. Bought 8 and all came ready to install! 
3524 4 This was a birthday gift for my wife. Her Nikon D7100 fits in here along with her 24-70mm lens and her primary lens. Great for carrying her camera and tablet and other stuff. She loves it! This is a keeper. 
3525 4 Excellent. I bought this for a Panasonic Lumix FT6, and its much slimmer than apparently all the alternatives. Floats well and doesn t look like a lift jacket on my wrist. 
3526 3 great flash 
3527 4 Excellent filter. I got amazing pictures. 
3528 4 Great!! I love it 
3529 4 great 
3530 3 Good camera, great zoom. The USB connector is hard to use and seems prone to breakage. External charger recommended - connecting camera to wall electrical outlet using the connector in the camera is not convenient at all. 
3531 4 Great product. Setup was simple. Works as advertised with no problems. I would buy this again. 
3532 4 very compact, great quality. would buy again! 
3533 4 works well 
3534 4 worked grate for what i was using it for. 
3535 4 I was nervous but pleasantly surprised. Very nice case and fits all my Phantom 3 components perfectly. I usually never leave feedback either. Good purchase 
3536 0 Zero stars if I could. This item doesnt work to charge your camera. Dont buy it! Waste of time and money. 
3537 4 used very well 
3538 4 Bought these to clean fingerprints off the screens of our tablets and they work great. 
3539 3 Met expectations. 
3540 3 This product is just what I needed to comfortably carry my camera and equipment in. I especially like the side pocket for storing a mini tripod. Everything that I currently use fits inside and it is still light weight and easy to manage. 
3541 1 another one bites the dust after I took it in the water 100 buck down 
3542 4 camera works great as it should and is water proof.battery last a long time. 
3543 4 it is a beautiful, fashionable product and i love it so much 
3544 4 Great value for money. 
3545 3 Everything fit in nicely. Nice sturdy case with handle. My only complaint is you have to be sure to open it right side up or it all falls out. It needs a lid inside so things don t fall out. 
3546 4 It replaced a like unit that I wore out. This one is in very good condition, and I am having absolutely no problems with the camera. Thanks for asking. 
3547 4 This worked very well for my very old Jason 12 x 40 binoculars. Easy to get on and off and kept the binoculars protected while in my backpack. 
3548 4 Excellent product. Well built n light! 
3549 2 I feel cheated, I did not get all of what I should be able to, the lens is only one, should the two 
3550 4 think tank is the way to go, I can carry my stuffs without a bag now 
3551 4 Works, good price 
3552 0 Camera did not recognize this battery as Info-Lithium. 
3553 1 Meh optics, sent it back. 
3554 4 Nice stand and price 
3555 3 I like the compactness and versatility. 
3556 4 Bought for daughter who is 10 
3557 3 Does what it says 
3558 4 Cheap cost. Well made. It s light and easy to operate. Awesome! 
3559 3 Very nice for a point and shoot. Takes great pictures does everything as advertised. 
3560 4 Works great with my Nikon D7100 
3561 4 Great batteries! Good charge time. 
3562 4 The original model order had been discontinued. The substituted camera (this model) has been installed and is working wonderfully. The images seem to be sharper. Quite happy with this purchase. 
3563 4 Works well. I have not had issues with it. 
3564 4 Great product. 
3565 0 Does not work 
3566 4 This camera is absolutely fantastic. I got it during one of the promotions, and I am very pleased with my decisions. The photo quality, camera size, battery life, wifi, etc all a plus. 
3567 4 Works great!! 
3568 3 I am very happy with all of our purchases. 
3569 4 Another cool go pro mount for a GREAT price! 
3570 0 My tv lamp popped five minutes after I put it in, the glass on it was in pieces, the product was defective, I have bought this product before and it took a year for it to do that, so I was very unsatified this time around 
3571 3 I use this periodically for my camera it works great. 
3572 3 Video recording quality is not that great but takes great shots. 
3573 4 I really love this camera bag. I have my camera, 2 lenses, a laptop, a sound recorder, headphones, and a ton of other stuff in it, and it holds everything in place very well. I would definitely recommend buying it! 
3574 3 Given as a gift. They really like it. 
3575 4 Very helpful and effective.Thanks! 
3576 4 I m very happy with the product. I received it quickly. Easy to use and durable. 
3577 3 A little bigger than I expected but works just like I wanted 
3578 0 Literally bs, pay so much for so little and such bad quality. It s like there s a horrible filter on every picture. Don t waste your time haha 
3579 3 Perfect for what I want, very lightweight and clear,crisp lenses. 
3580 3 Good stuff 
3581 4 Great Camera with lots of features. The WiFi transfer screen is bit confusing but its OK. 
3582 4 Works very well - program syncing with transmitter was easy to do 
3583 4 love this pack 
3584 4 Brand new! 
3585 3 The light was awesome! Works great! The adhesive didn t work very well on the car door though. Had to use a different kind. The bat signal is super crisp and clear, but the avengers one is just a bit fuzzy. 
3586 4 Excellent 
3587 4 Great camera. 
3588 1 No, used it on Sony Handycam HD, it did not improve telephoto capability the way I expected. 
3589 4 everyone is amazed of the output and capabilities 
3590 4 Good 
3591 4 Great product, got some new clothes to go with my new glasses and frames. Couldn t be happier! 
3592 4 Great product 
3593 4 Replacement was a snap. just follow directions. Your device will last longer and charge fully after the first few uses. 
3594 2 that plastic is so weak,keep tearing apart 
3595 0 I m having issues with charging it will not take a charge at all. I purchased the extended warranty with it but I m not sure how to claim it. Any help would be great. 
3596 0 The battery was about a millimeter off from the correct size, so it would only make momentary and unreliable contact with the Canon camera s battery housing, which made it unusable. Had to send it back. Return was handled promptly, but I would recommend using another retailer for this battery. 
3597 4 This is my second order love them. 
3598 1 disappointed in the fact that the autofocus feature on the camera will not work with this lens 
3599 1 Very cheap and not easy to use I ended up going to Sams Club and having my slides professionally transferred the Quality was so much better at Sams Club then this device claimed there product would be, Stay away from it, waist of time and money 
3600 4 Works great, motion sensor record good at 30 feet. Only 720p so not real sharp and low light recording is dark. It has IR but I don t use it and doubt if it would be any clearer. 
3601 1 The small diameter of the tripod are is prohibitive. I have a very small tripod (fits easily into a water bottle pouch on a bag), and I couldn t get it into this tiny thing. At best, the diameter is 1.5&#34;-2&#34;. Don t recommend. 
3602 4 Great addition to my GoPro accessories....quality product.....great price....BUY this is worth it! 
3603 4 Can t use my camera without this... 
3604 4 Thank you, :) 
3605 4 This bag is great! I highly recommend it. 
3606 4 bought to go with camera as gift for 11 year old very cute -she loves it 
3607 0 I sent the product back. It didn t hold time. Nor was it user friendly. It also only recorded short clips. 
3608 4 Simply perfect! 
3609 4 Great product and prompt shipment! Thanks!! 
3610 4 Small, light in weight and perfect to carry anywhere. Incredible customer service with immediate response to an issue I was having. I would order again in an instant 
3611 4 Lost mine along the path of the USA so I need another one and this is the one I picked works great on my camera. 
3612 2 Had to return it because it doesn t fit my T5i with the standard lens. 
3613 4 Arrived early and tested the product in the field and it works well.A good investment. 
3614 3 I used these inserts while scuba diving in Aruba. They worked very well, keeping the inside of my Go-Pro dry and fog-free! An excellent product. 
3615 3 solid purchase...haven t had to use them much as I tend to mount my camera in other ways more often than not. 
3616 3 Fit perfectly. A little pricey for not authentically Canon. Did not receive cleaner cloth shown in picture. 
3617 4 I am thrilled about the quality of images this camera produces. 
3618 4 This is a high quality case for gopro cameras. It comes with the foam insert and the construction and materials are excellent. There was a slight issue with my initial order but customer service took care of it right away. Great service! 
3619 4 This product is a very good ,it lets you know when someone is either coming on your drive way or on your drive way. Thanks Amazon. 
3620 4 Perfect 
3621 2 The filters are of good quality and easy to use. I only wish that I did n t have to buy all the different size adap. rings each time I buy more filters. I use 62 and 72mm only. The others are a waste of money. 
3622 3 Purchased two, one worked the other we sent back. Received the replacement in two days and works great. We love them. 
3623 4 Works great. 
3624 4 The best 35mm lens in the market. 
3625 4 I m really enjoying this camera. It replaces a Nikon that poor battery life. Happy to say that this camera takes awesome pictures and is so user friendly. I love the rechargeable batteries too! Would definitely purchase this one again. 
3626 4 Fast delivered, very nice! 
3627 4 Clear, colorful pictures, lightweight and easy to handle. The supplied accessories that came in this package are sufficient for starting out. Didn t realize it came with a second battery. 
3628 4 Love this camera easy to pack takes great pics and has a strong telephoto. 
3629 3 I could not set it up on an Android phone. Set it up with an iPad and then I could get notifications through email. I bought factory refurbished and the work fine. 
3630 4 Nice that they have different magnification 
3631 0 When I got it seemed OK after recording one time tried to record again when I needed it would not even light up. I had even charged it up to make sure had full charge. 
3632 4 Great camera. 
3633 0 Terrible product. Has a bounce upon each revolution of the bearings. 
3634 4 This is a great product. Totally recommended product. 
3635 0 fake 
3636 4 I bought it for my mirrorless camera, it is a good quality Camera Bag. 
3637 4 everthing is perfect. We are happy.... 
3638 4 my son loved this. 
3639 4 Awesome case , nice foam inserts Just as described. 
3640 3 Original lens cap replacement. Design flaw is that there is no way to attach a string from the lens to the cap to prevent loss. 
3641 3 Good camera. Small. Takes good pics. 
3642 3 Nice 
3643 4 WORKS GREAT 
3644 1 Good Product, but it s not useful, due to the position of the camera. 
3645 4 This is a great little gadget. 
3646 3 Real little difference with the picture, but the product is very positive. 
3647 4 for my purposes it is great, light weight, nice zoom 
3648 4 The picture quality is good considering the resolution, .effective and easy to set up 
3649 3 Ok it works 
3650 4 Great Quality! For low-light applications the night vision works very well. It s like have a DVR at the front gate. 
3651 3 Adds lots of flexibility to any photo shoot 
3652 4 Installed easy to my alarm system. 
3653 2 did not order this camera 
3654 1 i would not recommend purchasing this item.. for a few more dollars you can can abetter product 
3655 0 Was shipped with an incorrect ac adapter. After purchasing a new adapter I found the camera did not function at all. I returned it. 
3656 4 Very useful product. Excellent condition. 
3657 4 My son loves this. So much came in this kit. For the price, I was concerned about the quality. I was wrong, the quality is great. He has used all the pieces multiple times and hasn t had any issues. Great quality, great price, great product. 
3658 4 Best purchase for the money. It keeps my cameras handy. 
3659 4 Excellent 
3660 4 I love this tripod, I saw a review of this tripod on Amazon reviews in a video with a gentleman withe no hands. It came already assembled. 
3661 4 Great camera. The optical and the digital zooms are better than expected. The picture quality is excellent. Even after a few years of use. 
3662 0 The wrong charger and battery was shipped. Parts shipped was not as advertised. 
3663 4 It fits perfectly and the string is perfect. Why the original didn t come like this I ll never know. Sony messed up. I lost it before I d had my camera a week. I believe this one will hang around longer! 
3664 4 Well built, saves the hassle of running a separate power line to the camera or other device! 
3665 3 It s all ok! 
3666 4 The battery last twice the time than the stock one in my camera. Honestly I am very please with this and I would recommend to anyone. 
3667 4 Arlo has many holders available. You get a bunch and an adjustable one with the $499.95 kit. they all work well. I bought 2 extras because I wanted to mount the cameras differently. It is a matter of your taste on what you want to use. 
3668 0 The camera and lens that comes with it are a good quality, all the other stuff is junk and not even compatable with this camera 
3669 0 Bad quality 
3670 4 The plug works very well charged my camera right a way 
3671 0 Tried to get ADT Pulse Hub to recognize it. Never was successful. I can t say whether it was the Pulse Hub or the Wi-Fi Repeater but it has never worked. 
3672 4 awesome 
3673 4 Cheap and convenience 
3674 0 don t buy it doesn t work with 1DX :( 
3675 4 Bought this for my Dad s 90th birthday. Arrived before they said it would. Was easy to set up. Very happy with it. 
3676 4 great product 
3677 4 Product was as advertised. 
3678 4 These lens caps are perfect for keeping your GoPro lens clean and scratch free. Perfect fit and the lanyards are a good size. 
3679 3 it works 
3680 4 This camera has been awesome to use. Really need a tripod for the super zoom to work. 
3681 1 no what I expected. Not expecting a fisheye look. I thought it was just a wide angle lens. 
3682 4 Awesome product! 
3683 4 I own a Blackmagic Cinema Camera and I was looking for a good wide angle lens. This lens is the perfect match for this camera to establish great long shots. 
3684 4 Camera is great but seller indicated all accessory and that didn t happen camera 5 stares seller 21/2 
3685 4 Great bundle. It had everything I needed to get started taking pictures. 
3686 3 Great product. Would have given 5 stars but the view when hanging on the wall is a little dark from the bottom. Will lower Frame or tilt to fix. 
3687 4 Great dea!! 
3688 4 great 
3689 3 Cap is good. Fits well. However it is unclear how the strap can be fastened. It is a big loop 
3690 3 Battery door is very difficult to open. Otherwise I love it as alleviates having to change batteries during shoots. 
3691 4 Great Quality. Great Value. Great company. 
3692 3 Works great , but is 720x480 ... P5534 is better! 
3693 4 Super fast shipping, amazing product. Made our vacation special. 
3694 4 Excellent camera, just the size I was looking for. It does much more than what I know what to use it for, but it takes great photos. 
3695 2 Pain in the ass.... The recording is complicating and the wires gets all over.. Going wireless next time 
3696 0 Conterfeit item,does not work for nikon camera 
3697 4 So far so good. Fits great, holds great. Seems well made. Use it with my drift camera and it holds that no problem. 
3698 4 This is a large bag that fits my canon slr with the huge 200 mm lens, and two other lenses. Easy access to The camera and plenty of compartments 
3699 4 My daughter loved it! Her friends and her had fun with taking pictures. 
3700 1 not very functional. 
3701 4 Exactly as described! Fits Canon Charger perfectly and of course the camera. Would purchase this item again and from this vendor as well. 
3702 4 easily a quarter of the price for same quality you would get out of something 3 to 4 more times expensive. 
3703 4 Great camera. I received it on Wed and used it yesterday for the first time. It is great that it comes with the SD card so it can be used out of the box. The picture/video quality was really good. I am happy I purchased it. 
3704 4 Ver y good 
3705 0 Not sure if was defective or just junk, but it only recorded 7 minutes until it started deleting the previous videos. This was on a 64mb card with 11 hours of available space. 
3706 4 Cannot beat such a neat little reflector/diffuse for such a low cost! Used it on a shoot today, worked perfectly! Gave just the right amount of flash that I needed to fill my subjects with! Would definitely recommend for someone on a budget and needs something simple. 
3707 3 Great product, easy to apply and use. Helps to place on an additional/extra back plate for change out during non-water use. 
3708 4 I bought one adapter before this one and it didn t work. (Maybe you saw my other review.) My pentax pk lense mounted easily to to the adapter, and it mounted even easier to my camera. 
3709 4 It s terrific having three optimized USB ports for charging phones and keeping my MIFI running while on the road. This device works very well. 
3710 4 These are great. Good buy. Will buy again. 
3711 4 The harness is a perfect match. It allows me to do the activities I love and create memories at the same time. I would definitely recommend! 
3712 4 Nice,look little fragile 
3713 4 a great addition to the gopro hero 4 black. 
3714 4 very good kit and lens 
3715 1 The first one broke as soon as I got it so I had another shipped...seller was great, item somewhat cheap 
3716 4 Batteries are a perfect fit and perform just like the originals. I like the charger also because it is not a fast charger and the batteries stand up in it and not laying down. 
3717 4 This is a terrific filter. I would continue to order Tiffen products. 
3718 4 good case 
3719 4 not a movement friendly camera though and no sports setting 
3720 0 The screw in plate that connects to the camera tripod mount was not threaded. There is at least one other reviewer that had the same problem. 
3721 4 Good light 
3722 4 Awesome 
3723 2 can t seem to get it to work right 
3724 4 Fits, no problems. Does the job. 
3725 4 Better than I thought it would be!! 
3726 3 A useful product of rather good quality. 
3727 4 it is very helpful 
3728 2 I bought this for my husband for christmas and he likes it. For the price, you would expect it to take a little bit better pictures but its ok. Only other con is that it goes through batteries very quickly. 
3729 4 Works as well as the branded battery. 
3730 4 Great value for the money and shipped quick. 
3731 3 Received my new battery charger in a flash. The product was of good quality and used it immediately upon receiving thanks 
3732 4 Fits well and thanks to the variety of sizes, you have options to make it work for your need. 
3733 0 Could not see a thing during night or day!! Returned. 
3734 4 My teen loved it 
3735 4 Excellent for see horse race 
3736 4 Great 
3737 1 No comments 
3738 4 The charge pack is so small and compact 
3739 4 Received product on time unit was well built and Exceeded my expectations for the price Had a small problem with tilt function but has been resolved. Great product for the money. 
3740 4 I love this lens. I have taken some really amazing macro photos. It came on time and was in good condition. 
3741 4 What fun! Takes some training to fly this properly, but it s a lot of fun to learn. 10 minutes goes by very quickly. Can t wait to test video capability. 
3742 3 Cute protective case but I m always a little paranoid of the side hinge coming undone. 
3743 4 good 
3744 4 Great little portable light source. It s very bright and compact so it takes little room in my camera bag. can be used as a fill-in source for close up photo s as well. Well morth the money, a good value. 
3745 4 This tripod is fantastic! Heavy duty quality construction, versatile adjustments, works perfect with my Nikon D5500 DSLR. Looked at many tripods and none come close to this for the price. Home run Amazon. 
3746 1 Constantly falls off camera lens, very limited use. 
3747 0 Very cheap looking and sheer. 
3748 4 Easy to use, instant gratification and lots of fun for teens who want more than posting pics. 
3749 4 Excellent product, a hard to find replacement battery charger. Works as advertised 
3750 3 Simple to use. Easy to understand instructions. Feels solid but can be a little finicky. Getting everything set-up correctly and it s a good remote. 
3751 4 Great camera, the zoom is incredible, i recommend it 
3752 4 all products delivered as advertised. 
3753 4 Great value - 1/3 boxes so far good. Can t find a better deal else where! 
3754 4 No leaks! Years of use now! 
3755 4 My nephew loves this. Easy to set up. Great resolution. Fantastic for all ages. 
3756 4 A+ thanks 
3757 4 This really works well. My wife uses it with the GoPro when scuba diving and it s great. Has never flooded on dozens of dives so feel free to keep whatever you need in the handle and it will stay dry. 
3758 4 Very nice product, daughter loves it for her new GoPro. 
3759 3 GOOD QUALITY NO INSTRUCTIONS 
3760 0 I must have older Flip...these wont plug into mine goofed again 
3761 4 Original Canon hood, so how to say, even though there is a circle gap between lense, it may be normal or supposed to be? I guess. 
3762 4 Like it it serve the purpose. 
3763 4 Works perfectly. 
3764 2 For a basic green screen setup this is ok, I only gave it 3 stars because the price is WAY too high. Also, there is no way to hang it long ways. 
3765 2 The quality of picture not that clear 
3766 3 package not good very poor 
3767 0 Not worth the money. Does not fit properly. 
3768 4 Great everyday lens should you not want to carry the extra bulk of the larger lens and just want to take snaps and not think too much. Bokeh effect is good on close subjects. 
3769 4 Very nice, light, and stable tripod that straps perfectly under my backpack. I like the latching leg hardware. Quick and easy. Ball top is stableand quick-connect mechanism is secure. 
3770 0 Magnet not sticky enough 
3771 4 I would recommend this product Works nicely! 
3772 2 A bit too big for my day to day needs, but still a good set. 
3773 4 Good charger. Better than expected for price 
3774 4 it is very easy to use very convnient i like it. also they have best friendly customer service. 
3775 3 The case looked really cool. The clasp however were cheap and was hard to snap or take off. 
3776 4 I bought it as a gift....it was happily recieved and used. 
3777 0 I changed all the settings on the back to self timer on my Canon 6d and I could not get this remote to work. I even replaced the battery inside to see if that was the issue & it still didn t work. Having to return it. :( 
3778 4 Awesome product, fast delivery. Thanks! 
3779 4 I m so glad I bought this! I had a great zoom lens before, but this is lighter to carry around and all the pictures just come out great! 
3780 0 Neat camera with great features. Like using it with my phone but the app is a little weak. Wifi stopped working after a few months and now the camera is worthless. Too Bad! 
3781 4 It is a great neoprene cover that protects the camera from scratches and minor bumps. It is adjustable and that makes a lot easier to use the same camera cover with a variety of lenses 
3782 4 Great Camera. 
3783 0 NO! It didn t! The darn thing didn t even work! I hope NOONE ever buys anything from Discount Jungle ever again! They are crooked! Update: July 2016- I NEVER got a replacement camera or my money back! 
3784 1 You get what you pay for. I spent way too much time on each prop to get them as close to balanced as I could. The system didnt seem to be very accurate on any even and balanced surface I tried it on. 
3785 4 Good quality if you are a person that takes care of your things. I hesitated at first with some of the comments about quality, however no product will last if you don t take care of it. Excellent value for the price. 
3786 0 It doesn t work 
3787 4 I put this on my E-M5, and it really helps give a more stable grip... adds just enough size to let my hand hold the camera more naturally. 
3788 2 good 
3789 4 Solid company 
3790 2 Not in love with the color. Feel like it washes out the color in your image. They re fair. But not high quality. 
3791 4 I like the customization available with the velcro insert - it fits my needs perfectly! The shipping was super fast and the item was exactly as advertised. 
3792 4 Perfect product :) 
3793 4 works great 
3794 0 This crap will void your gopro warrentee, do not purchase it. 
3795 4 excellent! 
3796 4 Outstanding Item and fast shipping. 
3797 2 excellent item, solved my problem 
3798 1 This camera did not meet my expectations because the motion detector mode and the sound detector mode activated the camera every 2 minutes for two hours. It works okay in manual mode and the image quality is mediocre. It does come with may attachments for mounting the camera. 
3799 1 You really get what you pay for here. The filters scratch VERY easily. 
3800 4 Excellent product very good seller 
3801 2 It brings life to my camera but it needs some upgrades. It needs to mark the buttons better. I like it a lot. It s not easy to use the camera at first. It definetly protects the body. 
3802 0 just a tipp to the EU customs offices. This device MUST NOT be imported to the EU because of a lack of user manual in EU languages. The user manual is only chines which has to be taken ass an afront to EU regulations and againt EU customers. 
3803 4 Awesome product & awesome quality 
3804 0 Didn t work with my Nikon D750 even though it says it is compatible. I spent an additional $5 for a new battery and still doesn t work. Save yourself the hassle and some money in the long run by passing on this and buying the Nikon brand. 
3805 4 Excelent! 
3806 4 Great mounting kit, with this kit you can really mount the remote anywhere. I have it mounted on my goPole to use as a selfie stick for my girls. 
3807 4 Does exactly what it s supposed to do - securely holds my flash onto my light stand. The clamp for holding an umbrella is a little tight at first, but that gives me piece of mind that it s secure. 
3808 4 The perfect addition to the RX-100 series of cameras. It gives you a nice gripping point that allows for a much firmer grip on the camera... 
3809 3 Use this for astrophotography. Works great. Use on Pentax cameras 
3810 3 Item works great. One must go online to read directions though as the printed edition has minute printing. 
3811 4 This was a great purchase with the GoPro camera! 
3812 4 perfect 
3813 0 Maybe it was me but I could not get the thing to zoom in and see anything. I returned it. 
3814 0 I bought this as a baby monitor and it does not work. The recording lags sometimes minutes behind real time or will time out completely. Nothing scares a new mother more than to wake up and see the video frozen. 
3815 4 This is renamed Looxcie LX2 which I have with 480p at 4:3 aspect ratio, good enough for the price I bought for $40.00. Red LED lit if recording, if you try filming ongoing police activity better cover that red LED with black cut out electrical tape before doing so, lol. 
3816 0 Motion detector does not work properly need to send it back to get exchange 
3817 4 So far so good! 
3818 4 Looks great, awesome quality 
3819 4 great 
3820 3 I miss the buttons that you normally get other that that great little compact 
3821 4 all ok 
3822 3 Great product and service, 
3823 3 My wife enjoys this camera,body color and great resolution 
3824 4 As described 
3825 0 I knew Bolide for good quality security equipment, but this change my mind, i bought 8 units, and 5 are defective, during almost 4 months of working well, 5 of 8, got a bad image. Really disappointed for this bad experience. 
3826 4 Ordered this case for my Hello Kitty Polaroid came and it fits like a glove. Took the camera to the beach and the case did its job well. No sand got into the lens and kept it safe. 
3827 4 Great thanks! 
3828 3 Great option for a cheap ND filter. There is some dark banding when turned all the way up in bright outdoor environments, but otherwise very usable footage. 
3829 4 Dose it record video with voices or without voices? 
3830 3 Very tight fit. Runs small 
3831 4 really good point and shoot camera. would highly recommend as a first camera. 
3832 4 This is a stylish photo album to put these pictures in !!! This is a bueatiful album looking in it just. Makes my day 
3833 4 perfect perfect perfect 
3834 4 better than expected, great value , at this price and quality can not go wrong. if your in the market for go pro accessories, this is the one to get. 
3835 3 Fast and Reliable 
3836 3 this is a nice screen protector it has done its job protecting the LCD and it is easy to install 
3837 3 Good product 
3838 4 Love this BW film. Dark blacks, bright whites and everything in between. Great in low light, really excellent! No grain, crisp. A fave. 
3839 4 I was very happy with the charger for my camera. 
3840 4 Easy setup. Works great.Excelent product support. 
3841 4 Well made and very spacious. For enthusiasts who like to protect their investment, this is an excellent case. Likes: size, depth of compartments, stability of drone storage. The retractable handle and wheels are very smooth when using. Dislikes: none. 
3842 4 Just what I ordered were perfect for my photos job 
3843 2 This one seems to have a very hard time staying connected to the wifi without being power cycled every day. The version below or before this one seems to need a power cycle once a month if that. 
3844 4 Works as advertised. 
3845 4 great tripod. The legs each have 3 adjustable sections. Feels light but solid as well. I debated between this one and a few options in the $20-30 range. I am glad I decided to spend the extra money for a brand name and still reasonably priced. 
3846 4 Nice to have both options for charging. 
3847 4 I love this product for my nikon d750! Arrived on time and was easy to apply. I highly recommend it!! 
3848 4 i like the side 
3849 4 Nice Nice Nice 
3850 1 Works if you only want to take less than 99 photos per sequence. Mine broke because of poor quality battery door, but mfg replaced it. Next time I ll spend more and get one that will take unlimited photos. 
3851 4 Stellar product!! A++++ seller, the only thing which was a personal preference was, I didn t like was the floating wristlet. 
3852 0 This camera was the most difficult installation I have ever come across (updates are way too complicated) and support and software was lacking. Would not recommend this camera to anyone!. 
3853 4 Awesome 
3854 4 Equipment is very durable! I am very satisfied with everything in the package I purchased. I would definitely recommend these products to anyone! 
3855 3 Nice unit, but for the price they should include the transformer 
3856 4 Fantastic. Was exactly what I needed for an active vacation. 
3857 4 Works perfectly on my D7100 and D3200. One of the best (and reasonalby priced) investments I have made thus far. I just wish I had picked this up before wasting $$ on various remote units. 
3858 4 I m enjoying my dvr it s clear and sharp for what I need it for... 
3859 4 Worked great 
3860 3 Fits my Canon t2i + 24-105, with my Speedlite on top ( not attached ) - I put this in my waterproof bag and take to the beach. 
3861 4 Good parts. Would recommend 
3862 3 Excellent for interview lighting. The boom is dangerously flimsy, don t use it. 
3863 4 This poser worked very well. The filling instructions that came with it worked well too, but was beneficial to have two people to do it. 
3864 4 perfect fit on the NETGEAR ARLO cameras 
3865 4 This item fits great on my Canon T5i as well as my ring light!!! Quick shipping too! 
3866 2 only records 20 min and stops and starts again...not able torecord a full event 
3867 4 Seems to work as expected. Delivered on time. 
3868 4 excellent 
3869 3 Great camera,but if you need to use there instruction booklet it s pretty much useless,got better advice from other people s reviews. 
3870 4 Delivery was fast. I have the vortex solo 10x36 as well and this has a more clear focus and seems a much bigger magnification than just 2. Although not as compact the polaris is a much better buy for the money. I highly recommend. 
3871 3 Me and my kids love it Well built. 
3872 4 Exactly the way they described. 
3873 4 fast delivery everything as promised 
3874 3 Fairly easy to use and takes very good pictures. My wife likes the ease of use and I like the WiFi connection to my computer for quick download. the Canon software is a download, so be prepared to take care of that if you want to use the WiFi feature. 
3875 3 Working well .I had trouble with written instructions. Maybe just me I biggest problem is getting it to stay looking forward in pocket nothing wrong with camera. I am going to try a pocket protector to keep it straight 
3876 4 My wife is a bit OCD and wanted order and this product was great. Great shipping and I will be utilizing them again. 
3877 4 Got all the basics that one needs. 
3878 4 Good sturdy camera, mounts easy, easy setup, comes with all the plugs and wires, counterbalance weight for the gimble. I mounted it all on a Cheerson CX-20 and it fit like a glove. Even survived a crash with no damage. 
3879 1 The set I received have no lining. They are just neoprene bags. They are okay. Certainly nothing like advertised. 
3880 4 Great Camera. can t go wrong though with a cannon! 
3881 4 Given as GIFT and she loved it. Recommend 
3882 4 These work great- I have several lenses and these cleaned them all right up. I mostly use canon ef lenses but they work great for pentax as well as my Nikon lenses. Definitely a but I d recommend to photographers who like to keep their lenses clean on the go. 
3883 2 Camera is great but lenses are crap, cheap and don t work on auto focus. Buy body and lenses separately. 
3884 0 Lasted 3 months as a backup battery and stopped working completely. 
3885 4 Can t believe I waited so lonh to switch to an over the shoulder style strap. This beats the tradition &#34;around the neck&#34; setup in so many ways. 
3886 4 I love it. Specially image quality! 
3887 4 Product arrived before scheduled delivery date and is as described! 
3888 4 Compact and easy to use. 
3889 4 Light, portable, rapid set-up, easy take-down. 
3890 3 Just what I needed 
3891 4 Love this thing. It s just tricky to close. The first time closing it was a nightmare; it didn t come with instructions. You can find wonderful youtube instructions, though. 
3892 4 Easy to place in my purse while traveling. 
3893 4 It s very easy to use, easy to clean, if it get s scratched, I have a spare. A good product to protect your screen 
3894 2 It works quite OK as it s price. 
3895 4 Perfect for my needs 
3896 4 everything fits in it s proper spot safe and secure! Only thing I would change is have optional shoulder straps! 
3897 4 Bought it as a gift and the daughter in law and she loves it! 
3898 2 It does not support 960H 
3899 4 Good stuff! 
3900 3 good products 
3901 4 Just as described 
3902 4 Awesome product! Very easy set up and they work great! 
3903 4 A better battery than battery that came with camera so far. 
3904 4 Excellent case. No longer need to worry about my go pro. 
3905 3 I have used this lens a lot recently. It is a gem. For a novice like me it is enabling me to produce some awesome nature photographs. Although it is a manual focus, it is very easy to use. I will not hesitate to recommend it. 
3906 4 These are solid and seem well made. I m using them to convert some older tripods to the Arca type quick release plates. They work fine with my Surui quick release plates, too. 
3907 3 Battery works great. Delivered on time. Great price. 
3908 4 Perfect fit! Made my camera look like new again! 
3909 0 Useless junk - it burned both my original Canon batteries - do not buy! 
3910 4 Case C6721591 Badge Ar004276 Product works great Technical support is EXCELLENT AND very courteous and helpful My Tech support listened to the problem and had the answers to resolve quickly THANK YOU 
3911 4 excellent!!! I have not use them yet. 
3912 4 I ve been using this light on top of my DSLR for wedding filming and it s perfect, high quality and I love the magnet snap on filters. 
3913 4 Fast delivery and the build quality is great. I reviewed about 10 floating GoPro grips in preparation for a Hawaii vacation. Glad I did the research. This handle looks great and has a good feel. 
3914 4 Bought as a gift and....Dad loved it! He s a carrier of multi-thousand dollar equipment and put his trust in this bag! 
3915 3 Decent case. 
3916 4 Recommend 
3917 4 Awesome bag for my new 13&#34; Macbook Pro with Retina screen and iPad. 
3918 0 Does not come with door or window sensors. Product is useless unless you have an alarm already in place. VERY DISAPPOINTED! 
3919 4 My camera works great. I ve had it for almost a year and haven t had any problems. 
3920 4 I ve used these all summer for about 4 weddings and they have never failed me once. Excellent bang for your buck if you re not looking to go over crazy spending! 
3921 1 Honestly, I feel like I get better white balance when using my white and grey cards. I followed the instructions in the video but this just doesn t work that well, in my opinion. 
3922 4 Works great. 
3923 4 Super quality 
3924 4 Great deal. Excellent bag for my Nikon D3300! 
3925 4 Great product. Perfect for the car. Love the charge percentage 
3926 4 It s pretty tight to release, but otherwise works great. Use it on my sailboat. 
3927 4 Great deal!!! 
3928 4 nice device 
3929 4 I bought these for a coworker and she loves the convenience of not having to find a place for her lens cap. 
3930 1 Did not work they were not compatible with the batteries 
3931 4 Last night I tested this device with my Panasonic GH4. It worked, as expected. 
3932 4 Worked great 
3933 4 Fast shipping great item 
3934 3 This was exactly what I needed! Perfectly well suited for my wants! 
3935 4 Fits perfectly and affordable! Will order again!! 
3936 4 great product 
3937 4 I love this camera bag it s light weight and holds everything I need. The strap sits perfectly on my shoulder and doesn t bother my neck. 
3938 4 It s perfect. I have several Cannon accessories for my camera but I m not a professional photographer and I want to carry my camera alone sometimes, so this is the perfect case for JUST YOUR camera. 
3939 2 Brilliant lens - wish it were cheaper. Will give 5 stars if it cost ~220$. I do repent buying the olympus camera - very expensive lenses. 
3940 4 Great value! 
3941 4 Works great, good price too... 
3942 4 I ve used these refills for decades and they work very well. Pictures are preserved and easily taken in an out even decades later. 
3943 4 great price and so easy to fly 
3944 4 Great filter. Great price on Amazon Prime day! 
3945 4 Nice roomy case and I love that the dividers are movable! 
3946 4 Works well 
3947 3 OK 
3948 0 worst pursuce ever on amazon does not record at all and just blinks fast and does nothing else so pissed 
3949 3 Works for the most part, but not as useful as I thought it would be. 
3950 0 Bought this at Khols and it could not install on my computer or my dad s. We tried everything! What a huge waste of money. 
3951 4 These are a great way to keep track of your lens cap. Works great! 
3952 4 Good quality, sturdy. Proved to be more durable​ than those that cost 4 times as much. 
3953 4 Works perfectly for the price. Simple to use. 
3954 4 Handy device for long exposures. In that it also has a timer built in makes it a great buy. 
3955 4 Very happy. Great value in the bundle. 
3956 0 I returned this after a few days - difficult to use, doesn t work in low light, and recording time is extremely limited. 
3957 3 I haven t really had a chance to use this like I want to but so far its worked perfectly. My kids are in sports and go to a lot of sporting events and this is the zoom I needed for all of it! 
3958 3 needs information for all strap use 
3959 3 SO FAR ITS GOOD STILL IN THE PROCESS OF USING IT IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS 
3960 4 Oustanding customer service after the sale. Thank you Walter for patiently guiding me through reinstalling the software settings. 
3961 4 Item was exactly as described, shipped super fast and packaged well. Couldn t be happier with the purchase. 
3962 4 Works great 
3963 4 It is so handy.. Save so much time and space by having splitter.. Good price also.. 
3964 0 the flash works but does not work with my canon 5Ti also, the flash is not the one where you can remotely use on its own. 
3965 3 Kind of expensive but it works really well and is super solid. 
3966 4 Excellent 
3967 4 I use the StackShot for macrophotography of minerals. It works amazingly, allowing me to capture incredibly crisp images of my collection. 
3968 4 has some great features, that it can fly itself is awesome 
3969 4 Great product.. 
3970 4 Quick and easy to use and easy set up. 
3971 1 One of the items came incomplete. I would like to contact the seller accordingly. 
3972 3 You can rotate whether right eye or left eye you are using in viewfinder. 
3973 4 I have purchased from Certified before, the first time was in person, and am still very satisfied. Great product, great warranty, and quick service. I would not hesitate to refer or use them again. 
3974 0 Did not work. So inexpensive I didn t bother to send it back. Just order another more expensive one the next go around. 
3975 4 The shipping was super quick! Once i opened the package everything was true to the pictures if not even cuter! Very pleased with this order :) 
3976 4 My first time ordering from Amazon and loved it. Will order again in the future. 
3977 2 Good video for small cam. Not mac friendly, had to download a converter. SOUND SUCKS, very low fidelity sound. Ya get whatcha pay for. It s worth something, not much though. 
3978 4 Simple and effective setup with easy to use. 
3979 4 I really like this case and it is built really well! 
3980 4 Arrived on time and is great quality! 
3981 4 Excellent !! 
3982 4 Lost my original charger, I m happy to have my camera back. 
3983 4 I ve just used it once so far, but it worked perfectly and was easy to program 
3984 4 Works great and arrived on time. Thank you 
3985 4 This was a much more comfortable replacement to the stock shoulder pad that came with my rig. I love that it fits snuggly on the shoulder. 
3986 4 Worked fine 
3987 4 If you have a waterproof camera, this is a MUST. You can toss the camera in the pool/ocean ahead of you and then grab it. great for snorkeling adventures. 
3988 4 Amazing product. works great. Definitely recommend it. 
3989 3 Excellent on mountain biking, motorbiking and jetskiing. 
3990 0 Broke right away. Didn t even have a chance to take any video. 
3991 2 Not really very happy with this product. It s difficult to use and doesn t give a very good charge to the battery. I rarely leave a bad review about a product, but this one warrants it. 
3992 4 Great system 
3993 3 Good battery. Finally one that could be charged and not continuously replaced 
3994 4 Very tall, sturdy and has all the bells and whistles I could ask for. Very Happy with purchase. So nice that it is so light. 
3995 4 Fine 
3996 4 Great walk around lens. I also use this for portrait sessions with excellent results. Image quality is top notch. I hardly ever change lenses now. 
3997 4 very effective and simple to use 
3998 4 This is a great price and works perfectly. I use it to trigger external flashes - does the job well. I was also pleasantly surprised to see all needed batteries were included in the package. 
3999 3 Case C6729888 tech ID AR004273 helped get cameras set up properly. thanks Henry 
4000 4 Everything was extraordinary 
4001 2 I have this on the Olympus 45mm f.18 and it doesn t really look good attached to the lens. It does do it s job of protecting my lens from debris and lens flare but I ll most likely end up replacing it with a higher qualit yone soon. 
4002 4 Awesome beauty dish. I love the quality of light and its very easy to assemble. 
4003 4 These batteries work maintain charge just as well as the stock batteries. With the charging dock included for these 2 batteries as well as another slot for the stock battery, this is a must-have for anyone who plans on using their GoPro for more than a few hours. 
4004 4 Excellent value 
4005 4 Can t beat it for the money 
4006 4 I kinda didn t believe I could get everything shown for such a low price...but I did. And it works! 
4007 4 perfectly meets the expectations. Thank you 
4008 4 Got this for my gopro didn t like it too much at first. But after talking to customer service they offered to exchange the old one out for a new one. The new selfiestick operate a lot smoother than the first. 
4009 2 Works well enough, but it came with a hole on the edge. 
4010 3 It s bulky. I pretty much don t use it because of this. 
4011 4 gave it as a gift for a GoPro since this was the specific brand that he wanted it. He has used the batteries and charger for about a month or so and has no complains thus far. 
4012 0 Within 24 hours of regular, everyday kind of use, it stopped working. Boo. 
4013 4 Good combo. (The tripod adds no value though) Great deal. 
4014 4 just what i wanted 
4015 2 Brushes are nice but the bulb is quite useless. Too dinky and as you squeeze the nozzle is moving in all directions. Get the biggest Bulb you can find. 
4016 4 Fits well and camera snaps well into harness 
4017 4 I bought this to use as a plein air easel for watercolor painting. I m still in the process of getting my attachments set up for it so I haven t used it outside yet. For the price, it seems stable, lightweight and has all the features I needed. 
4018 4 Henry was excellent and set up 4 cameras in 15 min Great camera s at a very nice price 
4019 2 Decent 
4020 4 Very good product love it 
4021 0 Item arrived damaged and dirty. Doesn t look new at all. After further inspection item is broken in several places and missing parts. Can t believe the shape it s in..it s terrible!!!!! 
4022 3 Took a little longer to arrive than expected, but it s everything I needed. 
4023 4 I just received the batteries, and they work beautifully so far. I am hopeful that they will last the test of time. They seem a great value for the money. 
4024 1 Macro is not great. Better buy separate macro lens. The sharpness and clarity is hugely compromised. 
4025 4 The video was too sharp the pictures were crisp it is going to make me a great camera like my 50d and my other canon each has it s uses 
4026 4 Very happy with the camera and bundle. It takes great pictures. The company failed to send part of the order, but were very quick to send a refund. 
4027 0 Good purchase and still working. Thanks. 
4028 3 Works great! Good Quality! Would definitely recommend! 
4029 4 Works great. 
4030 4 This works great 
4031 3 I like it very much it is great for when you travel and you want to take photographs. 
4032 4 This camera is so fun, cute and reliable. My daughter has made a scrapbook of all her moments in time since she got this camera. She is 13 and loves it. 
4033 3 good cam 
4034 3 wheels are very cheap and loud. 
4035 3 This camera works well underwater. Have not developed the film yet. 
4036 4 Priced Great - Nice Size - Quick Delivery 
4037 4 Great product and great service. 
4038 3 The vibration sensors worked the best and super easy to install. You have to have exactly the right door and window configuration for the two piece alarms. Certainly not foolproof, but a bit of a deterrent. 
4039 4 works great 
4040 3 So far working good with my 50 mm/1.8 Nikon lens.I made some interesting shots. 
4041 4 Very cool product, works well. I look forward to using it. 
4042 4 I was nervous about ordering a refurbished product, but I m IN LOVE with this camera. This is my first Dslr and i hope to take it with me on my trip to spain this spring. 
4043 4 Product is what I expected for the money. Everything works well. Havent used it in photoshoot but plan on doing so soon. 
4044 4 Great fixed lens. Equivalent to 50mm on Canon 60D. Fast and excellent quality. My &#34;go to&#34; lens&#34; 
4045 4 This battery works just as well as my Nikon battery! It looks a little bit different, but I ll be buying a few more of these over the next year. 
4046 4 Works Great! I was missing a rear lens cap and for only a few bucks I could pass on this deal I would recommend this product for sure. 
4047 4 Great camera. Amazing price. It needs a steady photographer but for the price is an amazing buy. 
4048 4 Great deal. Good little kit for the price. Really happy with my purchase 
4049 0 Rod bends when fully extended. Also button is useless and doesn t work. 
4050 4 The floaty backdoor works great. I have a couple of them. The adhesive is very strong. This is cheap insurance. If your camera slips from your hand its great to see it floating up, rather than sinking to the bottom. Believe me I know. 
4051 4 extra batteries are a must with go pros 
4052 2 It won t fit my camera, but I think it should be okay to use for other camera. 
4053 4 Camera is perfect for me and it has helped me with my golf swing. J-Made ensured that I got it quickly and I appreciated their excellent customer service in doing so. 
4054 4 Just as good, if not better than the hood that came with the lens. 
4055 4 Perfect 
4056 4 I am not a professional so this backpack works well for me with the couple lenses I have. Great backpack, seems well made and I like that it has all the compartments for lenses and other equipment. 
4057 4 works great so far so good 
4058 2 It s not so accuracy. 
4059 4 Great product at a fantastic price I am very happy with this set. 
4060 4 Perfect replacement 
4061 4 Nikon MH-67P Battery Chager was just what I wanted & works great 
4062 4 Just as described and works amazingly. 
4063 4 I bought it as a birthday gift and My friend loves it! Great gift idea for people who loves taking pictures on their iphone and get keepsake instant prints. 
4064 0 Hated it. It leaves a film that is like paste on lense 
4065 4 Perfect for my Galaxy 6 and I love the bluetooth remote. 
4066 0 Very Poor Quality 
4067 1 Hard to focus. 
4068 4 Henry did an excellent job setting up my camera. It is amazing how smooth everything works ...picture is very clear on my phone. I think I will get a couple more for the other side of the store. 
4069 3 Great battery at a great price. 
4070 4 It does exactly what I need 
4071 4 it takes great pictures - I am quite pleased with it.

4074 4 Great product ,never have to worry about losing caps again ! 
4075 4 Excellent 
4076 4 I am still learning how to use it, but so far it has lived up to expectations. Good quality at an affordable price. 
4077 1 Didn t notice really any difference.... 
4078 4 Quality Goods 
4079 4 Great film. Perfect for quick small pictures. 
4080 4 Awesome! Finally can get good pics at night like the moon and sky etc. 
4081 3 Thank you, very happy with the management of purchase - sale. 
4082 4 Very affordable protection for you home without monthly fees. Alarm is ear piercing. I have one on every window and door in my house. Batteries last a long time and are replaceable when needed. Small enough and portable enough to use even when traveling 
4083 3 Good product 
4084 2 Floppy 
4085 4 Solid product. Great price and it works well. The floaty device was even able to keep my GoPro (Hero version 1) plus the pole afloat in salt water. Haven t tested in fresh water yet. 
4086 4 This is what I need for capturing those big fish, and not having to worry about dropping my GoPro! 
4087 4 Excellent cleaning clothes for your glasses. They clean 100 % without leaving any mark on them!!! 
4088 0 charged one set of batteries right after I received it. After not using it for for a season it would not work for the second set. It will not even light up for the battery charge. 
4089 4 Worked perfectly for me. I haven t had any problems with either mount. Both have performed as expected. I would recommend this for anyone looking for either mount, it s a great way to get both mounts for a good price. 
4090 4 The Wasabi Power Battery Pack was just as described on Amazon. It also was delivered in appropriate time 
4091 4 Excellent quality 
4092 4 great pics - easy to use - love it 
4093 2 Good for lightweight cameras but not good for heavier models. 
4094 3 Works great. Love how you can tell how charged the battery is. Extra USB on the side is useful. Only complain, and why I only gave 4 stars, is the size of the unit, would be nice if it was more compact 
4095 2 These are ok antistatic bags but please note that 10x15 are the exterior dimensions, not interior dimensions (typically interior dimensions are used for other antistatic bags I ve gotten). The interior dimensions on these bags are 9x13cm 
4096 3 Happy with my charger 
4097 4 Just received the frame. It was very easy to set up. It came with a 16 GB usb. I loaded my pictures, and plugged it in, and it was ready to go. Very easy. The HD is awesome compared to my last picture frame. 
4098 4 product as advertised, very good 
4099 4 Works great. Just what I was looking for. Great product 
4100 4 I kind of wish I had bought a bigger one since this was smaller than I thought it would be. For what it is though, It performs perfectly. 
4101 4 Very good,good finish 
4102 4 Ill keep it simple because I m a novice. It s a great product. 
4103 4 Very easy to use. Fast shipping and great quality. 
4104 4 Love love it! 
4105 4 works perfectly as described 
4106 4 Works with my Cannon, great deal 
4107 2 I need a manual, it only records a minute at a time then skips a lot. and is there software to make play list, edit, add music? I hope someone can help me? I d like to give a better review .... I just think I never got the instructions. 
4108 4 Typical Nikon quality with fast auto focusing and sharp images. It is my &#34;go to&#34; lens for most situations. A+ 
4109 2 This was okay but I wasn t happy with some of functionality. So I returned it. I wanted something a little bit more high-end. However for the price it will do the job. 
4110 4 it s what I needed 
4111 4 Never needed this so far 
4112 4 nice product 
4113 2 Packaging bent it where I don t know if crease will come out. BUMMER!!! otherwise this should be a great item! 
4114 4 Great product at a good price! 
4115 4 really good , but with the time the water breaks in 
4116 4 Works great, holds any size tablet tight, unlike the one that comes with the Phantom 3. 
4117 4 Great 
4118 4 great product worth the money 
4119 4 Happy to find a replacement at a reasonable price. 
4120 4 Very good item 
4121 4 Does exactly what it is supposed to! 
4122 4 My daughter loved these items! 
4123 0 Bought on lighting deal. Had to return after a week. Delay on motion detection is ridiculous. What s the point. Got my refund. 
4124 4 Excellent case. 
4125 4 Excellent! Most comfortable strap I ve ever used...even with a heavy camera (Nikon D810) and lens (Nikkor 24-70 f/2.8). 
4126 4 I use these all the time with my GoPro and GoPole. I recently traveled and wanted to make sure I didn t lose my camera during my adventures and these made me feel a lot better about doing anything crazy with my GoPro 
4127 4 Fast delivery. Product as stated in the description,good quality at very good price 
4128 3 The Bag seems sturdy enough to hold up under use, however I have not as yet had the opportunity to use it outdoors. 
4129 4 Thank you 
4130 4 Worked exactly as described, easy to fit (perfect fit) no bubbles. As I already had one handy, I put a clear plastic protector over it, all works perfectly. 
4131 4 It was just as described and fit my camera battery. 
4132 4 Good product. Works as advertised. Would be great to see support for home automation systems such as Amazon Echo, Hubs like Revolv and maybe Apple s HomeKit. The notification part is necessary, but can be annoying. All in all - fantastic product. 
4133 4 These are well made accessories. If you have a polaroid cube you will need the tripod mount and a 1/4 20 camera mount adapter for some of the attachments. 
4134 0 Plastic price and plactic piece. 
4135 4 It s working excellently and I can recharge it at anytime rather than wait for it to get low.. 
4136 3 I gave this as a gift to my darling daughter. She was very pleased and I liked it as well. The package came intact and quickly. Thank you kindly. 
4137 4 Works perfectly, just what I needed 
4138 0 The Package I received didnt had the screw to be used to mount the go Pro. I have highlighted it in the image. 
4139 4 Perfect, as I expected 
4140 4 As described! 
4141 4 very happy 
4142 3 Good 
4143 4 Improved my product photography. Had to learn the right settings on my camera, but worth it. 
4144 4 So happy I came across this. Item functions as described. Always wanted to be able to geo-tag my photos. Excited that I got it for the right price. Thanks Amazon! 
4145 4 Works great on my Sony A6000! 
4146 4 Awesome 
4147 4 Good tripod 
4148 4 I follow the instructions and removed an anoying dusy particle always showing in my sony nexus camera photos 
4149 4 Love it, looks great and has held up well. 
4150 4 great camera, when I need additional wide angles, I m coming back! 
4151 4 Worked perfectly 
4152 3 Its nice value for money 
4153 3 work great. Fair price..Just dont have motion detectors. 
4154 4 love it, had to buy more! 
4155 3 Cleaned fine. Didn t fix the problem with the camera. 
4156 4 LOVE IT 
4157 4 Exactly what I wanted. A similar cable would not let me download my photos directly from my camera. This one works. 
4158 3 Received as described. Works fine. 
4159 3 Great quality, easy to use, perfect beginner camera 
4160 4 Walter with their tech support group helped me find an IP conflict on my router because I (evidently) didn t reserve the camera IPs in my router and my printer took over the IP address. 
4161 4 Much better than the standard battery. 
4162 2 Easy to apply 
4163 4 100% necessary if you have a GoPro. Nothing is worse than getting to your destination and finding that the battery you had in the camera has died. Great replacement for OEM GoPro batteries. 
4164 1 Cons : 1 - Flamsy. 2 - No .. including. 3 - bad full rig. Pros : 1 - Great price. 2 - Get the job done. 
4165 4 This item worked perfectly. My lens look like new!!! 
4166 2 The cord doesn t support I-TTL for my D7200 and any of my flashes however it triggers the flash just fine in manual mode. Will make a good back up for my radio triggers just in case. 
4167 4 Has worked very well with my Canon T3. Very happy with the product and price. 
4168 1 The charger stopped working after 6-months. How do I utilize the 1-year manufacture s warranty if I can t get any contact information for the company who makes the unit? It was purchased 10/21/2014. 
4169 3 Good for short to medium range. If you need to spot target shots past 100 yards this won t do, but anything shorter it is fine. Also used to look at the moon on a clear night and works very well. 
4170 4 Great photo tool. Getting some great portraits out of it. 
4171 4 Works perfectly, and shipped quickly! 
4172 4 Nice filters 
4173 4 works perfectly, easy to set your own code 
4174 4 These films are AMAZING they are SO stylish and leave your eyes with love the rainbow and stained glass were my. Personal favorite and candy pop was good too☺☺☺😍 
4175 4 Nice lens and filters. Cover for lens is a little bit less, and I cannot put lens there. Tripod doesnot hold anything, but it is not bid deal. I am glad that I bought that lens with these accessories 
4176 4 Good 
4177 4 good stuff. Quick, easy and made for fun 
4178 3 it really floats, its light and usefull 
4179 0 Pure Junk. 
4180 4 Product works just fine 
4181 3 I don t know why this has negative reviews. I think it s great. Mine works just fine. 
4182 2 the app is killing the quality of this product. it slows down the video as i move it. Sometimes the cam will stop. 
4183 4 Super fast service, item was exactly what I needed. 
4184 4 works great cheap price 
4185 4 These batteries work great. Best alternative to the much more expensive canon brand. 
4186 4 Just what I needed! 
4187 3 Nice camera, auto-focus doesn t work great but I bought it for manual focus use. Nice sharp pictures, fairly easy to use. Battery lasts for 4 or 5 long outings. 
4188 4 I thank you very much I use this all the time I make my videos. 
4189 4 My favorite purchase ever! 
4190 3 great ITEM THANKS 
4191 4 Fast shipping!! Everithing that was on the list came in the box!! Ever item in good condition!! Enjoying it!!! The camara is amazing!!! 
4192 3 Perfect for selfie addict like me.lol...The mounting part is very handy and i like the idea of using remote control on taking pictures..Very nice! I gave 4 stars since I received the product without battery for remote control. But everything works fine for me. 
4193 2 Well it works, but ive noticed that most of the time its a bit blurry. Depends on what your looking at i guess. 
4194 0 I only managed to get one session from this when the screw from the ball joint came out. Tried screwing back in and there no threading at all. 
4195 4 Working with no problems 
4196 3 I like it very much. I wanted to carry binoculars while backpacking, but I couldn t find a light enough pair. This will let me scope out the land without the weight. The description failed to 
4197 4 Camera works well, easy to setup. 
4198 4 its awesome 
4199 4 The little accessory looks great and adds a wonderful &#34;feel&#34; to the shutter release function. there is no going back once you have experienced it. 
4200 4 great product at a remarkably low price. Being able to focus at 0.5 meters is great for insect watching. 
4201 1 The joint isn t strong enough to use on my Harley. The vibrations are just too much. Probably great for a mountain bike or road bicycle, but not for a vibration machine like a Harley. 
4202 4 This cap will stay on. 
4203 4 I bought this as a gift for my husband. My husband was very doubtful but once he started using he loved it too! The pictures come out looking great! 
4204 0 Replaced the originally item only to find out the replacement is just as bad. The adjustment dial doesn t not change. 
4205 4 Not too bad, fits perfectly on my 22&#34; Paul Buff beauty dish! 
4206 2 OK --but tight 
4207 4 Perfect choice for the perfect camera. Good product with a good price. 
4208 4 These batteries cost a fraction of what an original GoPro battery cost. It comes with a charging dock and cable. The quality of the cell is very comparable to that of an original go pro battery. 
4209 3 Good product for price, only thing I could complain about is the siamese cable not as durable as I would like. System itself is very good. Cameras have good range, night vision good, very simple to install. Very satisfied and will be ordering the additional 4 cameras soon. 
4210 0 Images were not sharp at any distance, with and without a tripod. The original lens came with original Kit was excellent. I am returning it. 
4211 4 love it 
4212 4 Product was exactly as described and at a great price and very fast delivery !!! Will be back to this sellers page !!! 
4213 4 Alvin Matthews Excelent Help! It is good to speak with someone that is professional and patient too. 
4214 4 Light and excellent purchase. It arrived in perfect shape and works better than expected. Totally recommended. Ergonomic design and awesome touch screen. 
4215 4 All I can say is for the money wow what nice video comparing to my friendsthathavethe go pro I am glad I bought this all the accesories that came with it made it even a better deal.. 
4216 1 The battery dies quickly and it constantly has to be re-programmed. It goes with the the old saying &#34;You get what you pay for.&#34; 
4217 4 This is an amazing camera. I am so impressed with the quality of the photos, which I believe are equal to what is produced by my Canon DSR EOS. Great zoom on this too. 
4218 4 This is a great camera and so much fun to have instant photos to view and share with friends. 
4219 4 Good enough. I liked it. 
4220 4 Smooth transaction. Fast shipping. A+++. Thanks!!! 
4221 2 dont hold a charge for long. 
4222 4 No more worries about charging up my battery before I go out to take photos. I can shoot replace, shoot replace and go all day. 
4223 4 This was a hit at my party. Love it. 
4224 4 Great little lens for the price! Very sharp images. Very well-built lens 
4225 4 Good Product. Fast Service 
4226 4 A big hit with our family &#62; the older ones enjoy the views and the younger ones like having the ease of sharing their favorite photos beyond the usual social media sites. 
4227 3 The battery arrived as expected and I am using it in my camera 
4228 4 I love this camera. it takes amazing pictures is really durable and is great for vlogging which is essentially why I bought it! 
4229 2 these are a nice addition I would tell a friend 
4230 4 Very easy to use! I like it! 
4231 4 Theses cameras and the system were easy to install and it has a lot of nice features. The clarity of the cameras are great. I would definitely buy from this company again. 
4232 2 Not sturdy enough to move around, however it did the trick for the occasion... Good for the value and prime shipping was a bonus 
4233 4 GREAT LITTLE BATTERY S FOR MY CANON 
4234 4 The best point and shoot out there. I am a photographer and I love carrying this around with me on the go to take photos with if I don t want to lug around all my lenses and equipment. 
4235 2 Needs much brighter lights. 
4236 4 Almost everything my daughter needed for her GoPro! 
4237 2 Worked well for over a year, but recently we lost 2 ports on the DVR, followed by another 2 - cannot be used and do not offer a signal 
4238 0 Don t fit good even though size is correct 
4239 4 great price and good product. it gives extra protection. 
4240 3 Great product 
4241 1 So heavy! 
4242 4 Better safe than sorry and this rainsleeve gives me peace of mind knowing my camera is protected. 
4243 4 Life saver!! This has been an excellent purchase for me because I always have a battery back up ready to go. I use an adaptor often to plug into the wall. 
4244 4 I think this is a great starter kit for a low price. I m enjoying it. 
4245 4 works great, good deal for the money 
4246 4 Fantastic product, incredible technology. I was concerned about battery life based upon some reviews but have found this to be a non-issue. Only regret is that I did not purchase more cameras with my initial system purchase! 
4247 0 Broke the first time my 5y/o used it 
4248 4 Great Kit... As advertise.. and arrive on time. 
4249 4 Works just as described. 
4250 0 Less than a year old and will not charge to full capacity. Doesn t last very long. After charging overnight it only had about 30 minutes of charge. 
4251 1 The head is plastic and not capable of holding a DSLR. Legs are fine, but the head is overrated. Maybe for a dinky little point and shoot it would make a decent travel tripod., but that s about all. 
4252 3 Cool Kit, Comes with a lot of stuff 
4253 4 great lens for macro photography or portraits 
4254 4 Love it 
4255 1 no work for me 
4256 4 Love this. Video is excellent, sound is also high quality. The time lapse mode is awesome. Love that the wifi will send updates to the camera automatically without having to plug it in anywhere. Battery life is pretty low, but I was expecting that and got two extra. 
4257 4 Excellent filters at an amazing price. 
4258 4 All good thanks 
4259 3 It works 
4260 2 The focus does not seem to always be in focus once you zoom the lens. Otherwise small, compact and easy to use. 
4261 4 Excellent item 
4262 4 Exact l y what I needed 
4263 1 Took me a while to put together. No manual 
4264 4 It was just what I wanted! Compact and sturdy. 
4265 3 Great for controlling the flash gun beam in a pinch 
4266 2 not very stable... loose between clicks, but it does the job. 
4267 4 This lens! If you re looking at it and can afford it, you will never regret it. Just amazing and clear!! 
4268 3 This was to replace the pistol grip on my Sunpak tripod. Works fine but didn t realize that the plate wasn t a quick release like others but really not a problem to turn the base plate knob to remove. 
4269 4 The shield fits nice in the camera To be honest u don t no that it s really their, Nice product The small one for the top of my d7100 also fits nice Thank you would buy again 
4270 4 The best shotgun mic on the market! 
4271 3 So far so good...used them for an even this past wkend, very pleased. 
4272 4 So far I love it. I had no problem connecting to WiFi. The pictures are great. The battery lasted 8 days of my 10 day vacation. It was nice to have a second battery all ready to go. 
4273 4 Olukai are THE best ! 
4274 4 Fits perfectly on my new Olympus OM-D E-M5 mk II. Install was easy and the fit is perfect. I couldn t tell that I had the Expert Shield installed. 
4275 4 item delivered on time and perfect 
4276 4 Best PTZ camera for this money 
4277 4 Amazing 
4278 4 I was hoping a new charger would solve my battery problems and I was correct. My charger was delivered on time and I m very happy with the product. 
4279 4 Works great 
4280 4 Perfect for my lenses which don t come with a pouch. Enough protection to store in a backpack. 
4281 4 Like all Pelican cases; this is well worth the price. 
4282 4 Excellent quality, highly recommended 
4283 2 fair case with cutouts for separate compartments. not very padded for protection on the bottom,otherwise nice storage case that fits all go pro and other small pov cameras! 
4284 0 One battery charged and performed adequately, but one battery would not charge and caused a &#34;battery not compatible&#34; error. 
4285 4 We used this selfie tool once and liked it so much. Easy to handle, extend to full length that we could easily take 12 people selfie. It is convenient to have small Bluetooth controller. We are satisfied with this product. 
4286 0 Instruction are only in chinese. I am wondering how to conect it. 
4287 3 Its ok-I wouldnt tell anybody not to buy this product 
4288 4 Outstanding. Witty, clear instructions. Very simple to apply. Fits perfectly. I m a fan 
4289 4 Great for the price! Will be buying more! 
4290 0 I would never buy again. The only reason I didn t return is because I ran wire around my home. Never again 
4291 3 Like it. 
4292 4 a real walk-about-lens great build very sharp. 
4293 4 Great Product. Just as describe! Will buy again! 
4294 0 Cheap and hideous 
4295 4 Lost my original charger and this works perfectly! 
4296 4 was easy to set up, we are easily able to connect to the security camera with android and windows devices from home or wherever and quickly see the footage at our storefront even at night. 
4297 4 ewery thing was fine thank you 
4298 3 My copy of this adapter was a bit tight on the lens side which I m okay with. x mount end is a little sloppy on to the camera body. It doesn t seem to cause any issues, however. But I ll dock a point for being not quite perfect. 
4299 4 Super smooth, solid, and the price is great. I tried out another more expensive slider first and I couldn t stand it--glad I tried out Konovo. 
4300 4 Great Buy ! 
4301 0 The tension pieces broke the first time I put it on the camera. Now it s useless. 
4302 0 The quality of the picture is very poor. My iPhone s camera takes better pictures. 
4303 4 Best action camera on the market PERIOD....I own two no name and all four &#34;competition&#34; to go pro ...with the mounts with all it can do with its app nothing COMES CLOSE!!!! so nice now I need 3 more and a 3 gimbal and underwater mounts ;) 
4304 4 Good product at an excellent price. Very Quick shipping. Would buy from again 
4305 4 This is a great unit for the car. It s the perfect size. It s very sturdy 
4306 4 Works perfectly right out of the box for my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook Pro. A lifesaver on a long plane flight 
4307 4 package was delivered 
4308 3 Very compact and versatile. Works well with my sony a6000 
4309 4 GREAT LENS .. I USE THIS LENS FOR EVERY THING.. 
4310 0 totally and completely worthless. extremely unstable. check out the how small the legs are. unless you are using a tiny COMPACT mini camera it will cost you a broken camera. MOST IMPORTANTLY THE SELLER IS TERRIBLE. RESTOCKING CHARGES AND AN ATTITUDE MAKES YOU WISH YOU NEVER BOUGHT FROM THIS SELLER. 
4311 4 Well made bag! Perfect for my needs. If you have a huge camera with a long lens, you might want to look at Tamrac s larger bag. But for someone like me, it is the PERFECT bag. Holds my Canon 70D and 4 lens with no problem. 
4312 4 excellent 
4313 4 I like having extra mounts, everything fit s and work s great 
4314 3 Sharp as can be but hunts a little. Overall a very nice lens 
4315 4 Easy to use. Great 
4316 3 I am pleased enough that I am planning on buying more, this time with Bluetooth. 
4317 4 Works great. Good price good quality. 
4318 4 nice 
4319 2 Doesn t live up to it s billing. I returned the lens in question 
4320 4 Bought for camera and so happy I did! 
4321 2 All camera functions work, battery indicator always blinks as low battery; perhaps it needs just a little more power 
4322 4 I think this is a cool idea. It s small, takes seconds to set up and it has the dusk feature for 4 or 7 hours, Helps make the house look like someone is home with little power usage. 
4323 4 great looking FAKE camera. really easy to install, looks real. comes with flashing red light( if you install AA batteries). 
4324 3 Pleasantly surprised at quality 
4325 4 I am blown away by how high end this tripod looks and feels. Better than I expected. Holds my T5i with battery grip and 75-300mm very secure. 
4326 4 great camera 
4327 2 good backdrop lights are okay--- wish I would have got the LED- screwing 5 bulbs into 3 bases makes them NOT really portable--- GO LED 
4328 4 Camera is what was described. I love the zoom. Great price! 
4329 4 OMG ! It s too cute ! Love it so much ~ HelloKitty fans Must have item 
4330 0 Broke after a week 
4331 4 Exactly what I thought it would be. I am satisfied with this product. 
4332 4 Best investment I made........Works great when you re taking sports pictures and it also works with your auto focus motor 
4333 4 Just what I needed, priced resonable and shipping wasn t outragous. 
4334 4 great idea 
4335 4 One of the nicest/most quality lens pens that I ve ever purchased. Great buy! 
4336 3 Thank you... Now I can download my pics from my New camera 
4337 4 Very good made. I recommend this product. 
4338 4 Fits perfect while still easy to remove scope cover, I m really happy we added it to the purchase of our scope 
4339 4 works great 
4340 4 The item was perfect and delivered on time 
4341 4 I love the interchangability of these flaps - great idea. 
4342 4 Great, secure fit! Worth the extra money. 
4343 3 The end connecting into the camera is not as snug as I think it should be, but it works fine. Just need to handle camera more carefully and watch that connection is still in place. 
4344 0 Constant issue with the power supply 
4345 0 Crapy product. Save your money and get a promaster. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008SSMYZ0?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00 
4346 2 Had I realized about the vector effect, would have purchased a round rubber flexible hood which is what I had before 
4347 4 very good 
4348 4 Works Perfect. 
4349 3 Nice product 
4350 4 Quality charger. Happy with purchase. 
4351 4 Everything was shipped safely and in good order and for such a bargain price. 
4352 4 Great battery Good price!!! 
4353 2 I had this one month, everything was great, then the tilt stop working, I hope they will make it good without me having to ship it back to China. Otherwise I would of rated it 5 stars. 
4354 4 Awesome camera. You have to learn how to use it for sure but it takes really nice pics. 
4355 4 perfect for what i wanted 
4356 4 Fits my Nikon 300mm 2.8 vr 2 
4357 4 Just installed. Good product! 
4358 4 Lighter than the GoPro and image quality just the same. 
4359 0 LCD quality is very low, contrast is very bad using with my GH4, don t recommend it much. 
4360 4 Thank you product works good. 
4361 4 Windows 7 professional 64 bit, right clicked the install file &#62;properties &#62;compatibility &#62;check run in windows 98 compatibility mode. Once the software is installed, set your USB to Serial adapter to Com 1. It worked right away. Took control over the built in hand controller. This is very cool. 
4362 3 Good 
4363 0 Wasn t loud at all, could barely hear it 
4364 4 Gift for granddaughter. No info yet on performance. 
4365 4 I was unable to mount a speed light on the grip so with the zoom device it made it easier plus having a PC connector available. 
4366 4 Great BUDGET lense for the price! Works great on a Canon Digital Rebel XT. 
4367 1 The view is decent at night but blurry during the day even when it is adjusted for focus 
4368 3 Lens worked great with canon 70d or Apsc camera, this doesn t work on full frame canon 5d mark III camera 
4369 4 I love this camera. It is small enough to fit in my purse and works great! 
4370 4 Great set. Works great with my GoPro Hero 4 Silver. Nice fitting chest mount and head mount. Extra screw is nice as well and fits everything, including other official GoPro mounts I have. I would highly recommend this, especially at a great price. 
4371 4 Great for the price 
4372 4 Great product. For once, I have more pockets than stuff! 
4373 4 This is a very nice lens cap for the price. The fit is better than with the oem in my personal opinion. Shipping time to the U.S. is not the best with any of the current sellers, however. 
4374 4 Fantastic. Did not expect this to be so good. But there is always a flaw to a product and it is the microphone when on a the bike mount. 
4375 4 Very good camera. Reacts quickly and smoothly through wifi. Clear image. 2 way audio if very good 
4376 3 This is decent for quick review of 35mm slides and negatives. I wouldn t use it to gauge colors. 
4377 4 They work as advertised. Clean eyeglasses and screens well. Fiber pieces big enough to actually hold in your hand unlike the itty bitty cloths that you get with eyeglasses. 
4378 4 It was a quick, easy setup. It worked great the first time and seems fairly durable. 
4379 4 Fantastic. I shot a movie and tossed this critter in my bag and used it as an eye light and as a computer light. Dang thing runs forever! (or so it seems) 
4380 4 A great lens for macro as well as general photography. It produces a very sharp image. I have found my normal lens for the Nikon D3200. 
4381 4 It is a good complement for your camera specially if you like to take couple pictures in a trip. 
4382 4 Nice!!!! 
4383 4 Use these all the time 
4384 4 awesome! 
4385 3 Works as advertised 
4386 3 Basic yet adequate product 
4387 3 It works as suggested by the other reviews. 
4388 4 Nice 
4389 4 great lens clothes, just the right size 
4390 4 This is a genuine Canon battery and works perfectly in my Canon T6s camera. I think you should always have a charged spare battery on hand when on a photographic trip to avoid the sad event of a power failure. 
4391 4 I really like the effects of this lens. At 10 stops, my dSLR can literally see nothing through the viewfinder. Please pardon the Spinal Tap reference. I could not help myself. 
4392 4 you push it to turn it on and off! very convenient 
4393 1 I found this product to be very flimsy without much padding to protect my camera and lenses. It is also lacking in pocket space. I have a case that is half the size with many more pockets and thick padding and I fit more things in it. 
4394 4 It is so hard to find a strap for my semi-compact Canon camera, and this is the best you can get imo. I really love it! 
4395 4 Excellent product.... Technology is super.... Ease of use is outstanding... It s a ready to go unit in a box... Compare it to a High End Security service... Security service would cost a minimum of 2k... Believe me, I priced them!!!! 
4396 4 Perfect and great... 
4397 4 Product arrived as described in a timely manner. I ll gladly buy again for future lens cap needs. Recommend. 
4398 3 Pro: - works very well Cons: - it drains the battery 
4399 4 excellent 
4400 0 Terrible product, too many problems to waste my time writing about it ,no customer service ,just find another company then Lorex , and I don t normally write a 1 star review but this product and company did it .... 
4401 2 this bag was a really nice bag... lots of pockets.. just not big enough for what I needed 
4402 4 Was an excellent purchase. Love it! 
4403 0 If you re a Pro. Don t do it. Spend the extra money for the Canon. I should have just thrown $70 down the toilet. Live and Learn... 
4404 4 I absolutely love this lens. I am still a newbie w/ DSLR. And this lens has made me so comfortable behind the lens. It has to be my favorite. 
4405 4 Love this! Awesome product Love this! Awesome product.Does the job perfectly. Fast delivery. Quick and easy to assemble, works great! Highly recommended! 
4406 4 if you own a camera and it taiks these batteries ... then its the perfect buy... has saved my many times when one battery dies and your still wanting to take pics 
4407 0 Did not fit my lenses. The adapter fit into my camera body fine, but the lens mount was wrong. Ended up returning. 
4408 4 intake, compression, power and exhaust 
4409 4 Perfect 
4410 4 Love this collection. Good quality - came faster than expected. Very nice. 
4411 4 Great camera and cost/benefit for the kit. It really worths it. 
4412 4 excellent product. 
4413 3 Just got my camera hooked up. The technician was very awesome! CASE#C6728526; AR004246, ALDY; Kyle, Case#C6728562; AR#AR004218 
4414 2 CHEAP quality.. almost a toy. buy something better. 
4415 0 Very cheap quality. It wasnt out of the box and it was broken! DO NOT WASTE YOUR 11 DOLLARS JUST MAKE THE INVESTMENT IN A GOOD TRIPOD!!! 
4416 4 Very Good 
4417 4 These thing is cool with alot of upgrades to be done. 
4418 0 this does not work well, the setup is confusing the company will charge you to help set it up. I did get it to work after 4 hours but the recording process stinks. I don t recommend this product at all 
4419 4 Nice, cheap, and works well. 
4420 4 Great IP cameras for around the house. Will FTP snap shots or full HD video (720p) to any FTP server. 
4421 4 Awesome camera has multiple filters for one shot and uses some different angles for one shot. and capture photos very well. 
4422 4 Excellent and fast shipping! 
4423 4 This was a great replacement to my lence. although it is a little loose, it does the job. 
4424 4 Awesome first stage of alert. 
4425 4 Love it 
4426 2 Received it and found all these white marks on it. Looks like chalk 
4427 4 Nice power box with plenty of capacity. 
4428 4 Love the go pro!! My kids love it more 
4429 4 Nice product and good quality. Delivery was way to slow. 
4430 4 Highly recommend. 
4431 4 Very smooth gearing - and mounts nicely on tripod. 
4432 4 I am writing this review regarding the excellent service I received from Titathink Support Service. Taylor was able to help me correct my problem very efficiently and with excellent customer service I will purchase more products from Titathink. 
4433 4 Henry, Thank you very much for helping me set up my foscam! Very easy and simple. 
4434 4 Came in time and as advertised. 
4435 4 did not use this camera , sent it back , wrong type 
4436 4 Fits and works as expected. 
4437 4 Just what I was seeking at a fair price 
4438 4 Exquisite B&W film..use it with old school fold out Polaroids...awesome results..! 
4439 4 Great little camera. Very clear images. Zoom is great. This my second one exactly the same because my first one got wet (stupid me!!) and stopped working. Had to have exact same one because I liked it so much. 
4440 1 Nice unit, but range is 50-75 feet 
4441 4 Not much to say excapt taht it works well and is priced right. Now I have an extra one that I keep at work. 
4442 4 Well made, just what I have come to expect from Neewer 
4443 4 This is a great lens for the price. I used it to take pictures while traveling and found the long zoom capability to be very handy. The pictures that I took came out beautifully! 
4444 4 Much smaller than its seems but I m a short girl so it looks nice on me! 
4445 4 A great bargain for a good camera! 
4446 4 Great accessories for your Go Pro and it all comes in a nice case. 
4447 4 Excellent quality, highly recommended 
4448 4 Bought this for my daughter and she loves it! 
4449 4 Love these!! They re amazing and so dependable!! 
4450 4 A great buy. The charge last a long time. 
4451 4 Great camera ...great pictures 
4452 4 excelent 
4453 3 more features than I can figure out how to use. still learning how to make it go. 
4454 3 Works pretty good for the price Can see a black ring around the edge unless you zoom a little on the phone. Used on iPhone 6 and droid turbo 
4455 4 this is my first tripod i just recently opened a youtube page and needed it its awesome thanks https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1J5rgMIfqZJkJDL--JoA6Q 
4456 4 Bought this a while back and it has been my prime lens ever since, the quality of it is amazing photos are so clear even in low light i completely recommend this lens 
4457 0 Works but it s stuck on my Nikon. 
4458 4 TAKES GREAT PICTURES AND EASY TO USE. 
4459 3 Easy to set up! Picture quality is better than average! Can t beat the price! 
4460 4 Works well and looks good. Quick delivery from seller and very good to deal with. Highly recommend 
4461 2 These are okay. Only really get tood shots from exactly head on :/ 
4462 4 works great 
4463 4 Very handy to have while swimming 
4464 4 Great product 
4465 4 Functions exactly as advertised 
4466 4 It is a good case 
4467 4 Im very unhappy with these batteries I purchase them months a go for backup never charging them until I was ready for my vacation and they fail. They did not hold the charge. I charge them the night before and then when to use them two dudes. 
4468 1 The strap broke immediately and the last 3 (of an expensive roll of film -only 12 photos) did not print out. Instructions on the &#34;lighting&#34; button on camera would have been preferred. 
4469 4 Great value, has everything you need for your gopro! 
4470 4 Good Product Works as expected 
4471 4 it s a D 80.. What more to day. 
4472 4 Great plan for 3 years. Hope I never have to use it but if I do then I will give a follow up. 
4473 4 Excellent 
4474 4 great little case for GoPro hero 4 but ordered a bigger one because it hold very little accessories. 
4475 4 replacement as advertised 
4476 4 Really helpful!! Love it 
4477 3 Doesn t fit the Polaroid camera very well, the camera turns on when put in the case. The Polaroid printer fits perfect. 
4478 4 Great price and they actually work! I ve used my batteries for a year and they work as good as the original... and they are mysteriously exactly like the OEM version. ;) 
4479 0 fabric is much lighter than show. It s pastel blue instead of the deep blue with dark accents. Very disappointed! 
4480 3 good battery power for my camera 
4481 3 The recipient, inasmuch as it was a gift, expressed his full satisfaction; that has not always been his practice as a response 
4482 4 Easy to connect to Smartthings, works great so far in a garage. 
4483 4 Love it..Great Product...Thanks 
4484 4 I have used this in two full cycle and both of them were just as good as the Nikon OEM s. With the way I used it, shooting and reviewing on the LCD, it shot 1,000 clicks and there was still 25% charge left. 
4485 4 Great product and fantastic customer service. I recommend! 
4486 0 This is the worst camcorder that I could ever imagine. 
4487 3 Love this Camera, decent priced and works great! 
4488 4 nice for the price 
4489 4 Good protection for long lens circular polarizers. 
4490 4 These little mounts are very versatile and they re a good thing to have in your camera bag/backpack. Great buy! 
4491 3 Great for super long exposures! 
4492 4 Got one just before leaving on a trip. Love the collapsible build. Like being able to just push it back instead of remove, turn around and screw back on. Worked well. 
4493 1 The batteries have a high self-discharge rate. After a week of non use, they need to be recharged. 
4494 4 Good Camera, Fast Shipping 
4495 3 A great case! 
4496 3 good product. Case very large 
4497 3 Well made and useful as a spare. 
4498 4 protects lenses nicely 
4499 0 Very poor image but great sound!!! 
4500 3 Everythings fits well. I wouldn t use this case for air travel but for storage, vehicle travel it works just fine 
4501 0 it works as long as you don t try to go over 5 feet.. 
4502 3 Works well and a great price. 
4503 1 POOR QUALITY, SOMETIMES IT WILL SYNCHRONIZE WITH THE CAMERA, OTHERS DONT !! DONT BUY THIS !! 
4504 4 works great for what we need it for :) 
4505 4 Jonathan Reed from foscam tech support was a great help, friendly and very knowledgeable. This was the second time that I have used the tech support and they have always been very helpful and solved my issues quickly. Love the cameras too! 
4506 1 The screen was scratched. 
4507 4 I still use it and it works great!!!! 
4508 3 Has a cheap quality to it but it gets the job done! I use it with my HOLGA and have not had any issues with it. 
4509 4 thanks 
4510 4 great bag and sturdy with lots of room for dslr, lenses accessories and an iPad. 
4511 4 Great Product!!! fast Shipping!! 
4512 2 This thing works, easy to setup but not great. The sensor was too sensitive even at the lowest setting that the reflection of the beam on my car did not trip the sensor causing the gate to continue opening slamming into the side of my car. 
4513 4 Used these on safari in Tanzania. I was amazed at how well the worked. We compared the glasses to another rated the same and these out performed them and we were all amazed. 
4514 4 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083WYDAU 
4515 4 Everything fine, useful as expected & good delivery service... First one came with a little failure, then I returned it and get a new one with no issue until today... 
4516 4 As expected 
4517 4 Nice product--good price 
4518 3 Great product.... 
4519 4 A high quality product with a great warranty. You won t be disappointed! 
4520 4 It was just what I wanted. 
4521 4 great product 
4522 4 I need batteries to last for over 8 hours, and these batteries go strong days after. They re perfect for a camera flash where I need a quick refresh rate to fire off a flash as needed. Paired with the Powerex charger, these are a must have. 
4523 3 It does the job..... 
4524 1 Image quality is poor on any setting. Action shots are impossible to achieve. 
4525 3 Great 
4526 1 Works so so... you need to be on ice if you ever want it that smooth if you get my drift! enjoy the bumpy footage! 
4527 1 Pins all bent up. Two sockets missing two pins each! 
4528 4 Great customer service and product is made out of superior materials. 
4529 4 Works exactly like the original 
4530 3 Works as well as the original GoPro camera batteries 
4531 4 Just like the originals, now the kayak has what it needs. 
4532 3 All accessories seem to be of good quality and function properly with my GoPro 3+ silver. Can t beat it for the price. 
4533 4 Awesome scope, with it s uniform size, not tapered, you can attach a green laser to sight in where you want to view, I just used rubber bands 
4534 4 excellent 
4535 4 fits well 
4536 4 Great purchase. Works well. 
4537 0 Not A mirror, very small , very low quality 
4538 2 I don t like typing 
4539 4 Nikon quality as expected. 
4540 1 They are really cheap batteries. They do not last 10 to fifteen shots. waste of money 
4541 4 Love it.works easy. 
4542 4 Works great! Nice clarity! Great Price! 
4543 4 A good price. Now I have a few spare covers at the same price as buying a single cover at the store. 
4544 4 Fantastic Product. Aperture ring is not so precise, but still manageable 
4545 4 i love it! 
4546 4 Great little accessory for my iPad. Great close up photos. 
4547 3 great item 
4548 4 It works very well!!!! A++++++!!!! 
4549 4 Kids can break just about anything. However this helicopter is easier to navigate than others. Its durable and can take some pretty bad falls or crashes. In the situation that my kid does break it. Its super cheap to be replaced. 
4550 3 Perfect for what I needed 
4551 3 It s an ok telescope, design is great and compact and easy to use. 
4552 0 These came without all parts. It said in the listing there was no manual, so I was expecting that.I was not expecting it to come with no peer sources. I had to ship it back 
4553 4 This is the perfect match to the LX 100 – it s fit and finish match and it even fits in the leather case. 
4554 4 i love it...as expected 
4555 3 Awesome , work great charge fast 
4556 3 Amazing for what it is. Definitely one of my smarter purchases. Does pretty much everything and offers as much as the gopro for a third of the cost! 
4557 4 But unfortunately I had to return the item because I received a new camera for my Birthday 
4558 4 Really good camera. Fast delivery 
4559 4 It was easy to setup and video quality is very good. 
4560 4 Great little camera! Fit perfectly on my 230 and 250 quadcopters and added very little weight! Can plug straight into fatshark or immersionrc transmitter. Good picture quality for fpv. 
4561 4 It works amazingly and the amount of light that it puts off is great. 
4562 4 GREAT CASE 
4563 3 Very good case for the Sony A6000. A kittle tight and a bit difficult to put and take off, But it works for me. 
4564 4 GREAT PRODUCT. RECOMENDT IT. 
4565 4 It is everything I have been looking for. Great for telescope. It makes my cell phone a mini TV 
4566 4 It appears to be a well made filter, Works awesome with clarity..I recommend it... 
4567 4 Awesome! Just like OEM batteries, if not better. You just can t beat the price!! 
4568 3 really good, only one time allmost loose it, 100m altitud and do not respond get back home!!! 
4569 4 Exactly as I expected.[[ASIN:B00NIYJKL0 GoPro HERO4 Dual Battery Charger + Battery for HERO4]] 
4570 4 Excellent alternative to cable tethering... Have to get used to the lag time when shooting Raw but a necessity for location shooting and really sets you free in the studio. Great advantage shooting to an iPad for client involvement and approval. If you shoot tethered... It s a must have. 
4571 4 Great to have for surveying and inspections, bought several to have when needed. 
4572 4 popped right on, works great!! 
4573 3 If you need it, you ll love it. Otherwise, its another piece of gear looking for a use. I thought needed it, but by the time it arrived I had found a better solution to my problem. Still, its likely to be useful in studio photography. 
4574 3 Quality is not bad. Good lights. Easy setup. 
4575 4 Works Great 
4576 2 It is a tripod - does everything I expected it to do 
4577 0 It says on the site that it is compatible with the T5i but in the book that comes with the remote it does not say it is compatible and I cannot get it to connect to my camera. 
4578 4 good clean product. I wasn t sure what to expect but after receiving the package and using the cloth on my glasses, I glad I purchased them. I gave one to my wife, I have one in my vehicle and in my backpack. I expect to purchase another order soon. 
4579 4 Used this accessories kit to go cliff jumping and atv riding. Never have problems 
4580 4 really good quality 
4581 4 the night view is very good, I can see my Sofa so clearly, also my door 
4582 4 Fun, fun, fun! If you love bokeh and want to experiment, this lens is for you! Play and have fun and expand your creativity. 
4583 3 Do it - this has been great! 
4584 2 Not really satisfied. I m not recommend this product to anyone. Usable, but not even good made, especially all bolts what you use to keep your go pro firmly. 
4585 3 It does exactly what it is supposed to do. 
4586 4 Inexpensive, reasonably well constructed, works brilliantly (also very light weight). Given the battery life in an A6000, two are a requirement, and being able to charge both simultaneously saves getting up in the middle of the night to swap batteries into the charger. 
4587 4 So awesome to have another battery ready to go. These are working great. Recommended. 
4588 4 Git it on time. Everything as written came.Learning to use, but like it so far. 
4589 4 I was really happy with this purchase and made a review regarding the quality of all the accessories. The only accessory that I think is not so great is the monopod/selfie stick. Here is the link to my review on this purchase. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzvifJOyfac 
4590 4 This is just the right combination of super optics, travel size and affordable price. There was no perceptible difference between these and Leica in terms of clarity and ease of use. It is super easy to adjust thr focus by turning just one knob. 
4591 4 see pics. that s a dell e7440 and Sony a55 w/ 16-105 zoom lens. 
4592 2 Its good but it tend to turn off my screen on Nikon d5500 when I use it. There is a feature on my camera when something cover certain spot, I can t view my viewfinder at all. 
4593 4 This harness was great. It was easily adjustable and fit both my 18 pound Beagle and my 23 pound mutt perfectly! 
4594 4 It s the most useful thing I have purchased in a while. 
4595 4 so great to use them 
4596 4 I`m using all these pieces and there is a great difference no using them. Filters are very useful for specific pictures, anyway you have to be patience for selecting the right moment with the right place with the right filter. Good lenses for taking pictures of insects. 
4597 4 Was better than expected, solid, and compact enough to transport. 
4598 4 Works fantastic and it s exactly what I expected 
4599 4 Absolutely worth it... Grabbed one of these to keep an eye on our dogs! Took less than 2 min to set up! I will be adding a few more of these once our house gets built. Great for security as well. 
4600 3 haven t really used them yet, tested them they all work, were shipped on time, so far I think they will work great. 
4601 4 Looks just like picture. It is perfect for any size cell phones. 
4602 4 I bought this for my Husband for his birthday And he had yet to put it down..he takes it everywhere 
4603 4 Excellent design. Can carry a lot of gear for the size. A bit over priced. 
4604 3 The photo is a bit red. It is all godd! 
4605 4 Great Item! Would buy again. Did not disappoint. 
4606 1 Monopod is useful for a video camcorder. Tripod camera mount plate/plastic clamp is so weak YOUR EXPENSIVE DSLR WILL FALL RIGHT OFF! You ve been warned. This is an imported piece of trash that is an expensive mistake! 
4607 4 Surprisingly simple and reliable 
4608 0 wy too small to use with a selfie stick! will work if you use the clamp from the stick for your phone or have a camera with a 1/4x20 hole in your device but that s about it. I need something with a wider stance (longer legs). 
4609 4 GREAT LENS. 
4610 4 Love it. Great price 
4611 4 Love the magnetic feet! 
4612 4 Works as it should (tested as soon as I got it) and the bonus adapter was great when we went to Paris. Unfortunately, I forgot the charger, and the extra battery (original), plus I left the adapter when we checked out of the hotel. :-/ 
4613 4 I love it 
4614 4 Works perfectly - much more convenient than the standard cover. And - the camera is not even longer (maybe by half of a milimeter) 
4615 4 Great product. Larger than I expected but perfect for cleaning for cleaning the screen of my phone and tablet. 
4616 4 Very bright and clear for day time, easy to use. Pretty powerful even for long distance but don t expect too much. Very good for general use, looking at bugs, butterflies, passing by ships etc. Would be great if the pouch has some extra room. 
4617 4 Quick shipping. Product works fine. We are powering 3 cameras with it at this time and plan to add more soon. 
4618 4 I m just a casual picture taker and 99% of the time use the automatic mode. The pics are fantastic. Great clarity, huge rage when zooming, and easy to carry. 
4619 4 Good tripod but no for heavy cameras 
4620 3 Thanks so much all products are in good conditions 
4621 4 Needed another shoe on our Canon C100 cameras for second wireless mics. The 1/4-20 hole at the back of the handle is the perfect spot and this shoe fits the bill. I bought 4, one for each camera. Why did we suffer so long without these? 
4622 4 Based on past experience, this sort of battery charger may be more apt to fail with heavy use; however this charger works well and, hopefully, will last a long time. 
4623 2 Not for heavy cameras. It will work perfect with light DSLR cameras and point and shoot cameras. 
4624 4 I bought two extras of these to glue together for lens organization in my bag. 
4625 3 Great for what its meant for. Make sure you clean the camera with rubbing alcohol before you stick this on. Used on my RX100 M2. Obviously makes the camera thicker. 
4626 3 works great 
4627 4 Item came in on time, in tact. Very happy with the product. 
4628 4 Better than expected. Easy to install and operate. Great system for price 
4629 4 Sturdy and heavy duty. I can pretty much angle my camera in an direction. This product is very well made! 
4630 4 Exactly as described. Quality is excellent. 
4631 4 It s great! 
4632 4 Works very well. 
4633 4 Great solid antenna with very good signal expansion compared to stock 
4634 0 Save your money! This is a piece of junk. The software is terrible and there is NO US support. Try emails to China. Look at the other reviews; all written by the same person. Buy a camera which has a US presence and support. 
4635 1 Well the build quality was alright but the actual use of this item was horrible. It would slide on its own and hit the insects id try to photograph. do not buy. 
4636 4 The cap fit very well. I have an old 35mm camera and lost the body cap. I can now shoot film and take my camera out and about 
4637 4 Just what I wanted. Works well 
4638 4 Great for boating or the pool. Easy to attach. 
4639 4 Great quality 
4640 4 Learning is half of the journey. 
4641 3 works perfectly 
4642 4 quickly and very good 
4643 4 This dash cam has paid for itself when my wife had an accident and it was all on dash cam. Great camara 
4644 4 Great bag, recommend to all photographers 
4645 4 Very versatile piece of gear. Protects cameras and lenses well, fits inside most backpacks and messenger bags. Would buy again. 
4646 4 Works perfectly on my 80lbs Doberman and she barely notices it. Would highly recommend this of the costly GoPro brand dog harness mount 
4647 4 Great product and a Fair price.. 
4648 4 Very nice product. It has work really good and the quality of the pictures is the best 
4649 4 Fast shipping and was exactly as described! 
4650 2 really if you look closely it looks like false but if you install it on the roof or in a faraway place the camera seem real 
4651 3 Great starter pack. Gets the chicks panties wet. One mount sucks. 
4652 2 Battery does not communicate with Nikon charger so you don t know whether it is fully charged. Disappointed. 
4653 4 A++++ 
4654 3 I don t like typing 
4655 4 Much lighter and sturdier than my earlier one, that weighed much more than this. Love it with the Sirui T-1205x 
4656 1 Inserted the sd card and it got lost in the camera. Had to take camera apart to get it out. Re-inserted, tested camera, and didn t work. Returned camera and sd card. Won t order anything that small again. 
4657 4 Good items! 
4658 4 Excellent product - camera fits perfectly! Super fast arrival time too! 
4659 4 Great product 
4660 4 The battery I needed for my camera and it works fine. 
4661 4 My Raspberry Pi is finally able to work with my older big screen. Just had to swap the plugs around to get the picture to display after I forced the Pi to output analog video (under the config file). 
4662 3 great gift lots of fun 
4663 4 Awesome with a rigid hinge. Robust better than expected perfect for a gopro or camera gear. 
4664 3 pretty good, nice kit that comes with a lot. be careful when putting them on though, they can stick really easily and can be nearly impossible to take off 
4665 4 very good item delivered as expected. 
4666 4 A perfect product for when you run out of juice. 
4667 4 Not much to say other than it fits and works perfectly. 
4668 4 Great! 
4669 0 One of the green pens is totally dry and doesn t work at all. Out of ten pens, only four show up on a black paper. The box is broken. 
4670 3 All excellent mounts. It does not use the contour sliding system, instead it uses a standard camera screw. 
4671 4 Great price and great quality. 
4672 4 price is very competitive 
4673 4 Nikon Brand so you know without a doubt....it will work! 
4674 4 OEM. Lasts forever. Great pricing. 
4675 4 Looks great, fits perfectly. I have a Canon eos XS and I got some old lenses from a flea market. They are canon FD lenses and everything works great. Just need to clean up my new (old) lenses and I m ready to go 
4676 4 I have Pelican cases for a lot of valuable equipment. They never let me down. 
4677 4 Excelent Quality Pictures with this camera, i look like a Pro 
4678 4 Works perfectly for what I needed. Super clean and tons of gain! 
4679 4 I stuck this to the tail of my airplane for some amazing in-flight shots. When size and weight are important, this is the one. 
4680 4 SO GLAD THEY OFFER PAGES TO EXPAND YOUR ALBUM. SO FAR I HAVE EXPANDED 2X AND ROOM FOR MORE IF I NEED TOO. 
4681 3 Works adequately. 
4682 4 I use it a lot for the Eagles that I watch and for some motorcycle rides. 
4683 4 I sent this camera to my son who is out of the country. When he uses wifi all the pictures will go to the cloud. If he loses his camera he will never lose his pictures. He loves this phone. 
4684 4 As described. Packs into small space. Ideal for macro work. 
4685 4 These are just what we have been looking for. Right size. Arrived on time. Works perfectly. 
4686 4 No More VR Issue. I received the lens yesterday without any VR issue. The lens is great. 
4687 4 These were my first pair of binoculars and man am I impressed. These pull in a lot of light and offer a crystal clear viewing experience. 
4688 4 Received these today and tried them out and I m very satisfied with the results. 
4689 4 Good 
4690 4 Excellent 
4691 4 Really a professional piece of equipment. Used with cameras of appropriate weight and this is a great tool. I have heavier pro version but don t want to carry on smaller jobs. This I will take everywhere! 
4692 0 I would like to know if the little screw that s long enough for the P3S is sold anywhere? The one supplied is not long enough to mount to the rc mount to eyelet. 
4693 4 Very happy with this set. I ve had a lot of fun decorating my pictures! 
4694 0 Got a couple of these. Both went down within a day of putting them up. I hooked them up to all 5 of my camera systems and they didn t work on any of them. One did last an hour longer than the other. Won t do that again... 
4695 4 fit perfect, easy to apply. 
4696 4 I bought this as a Mother s Day present for my wife. She wanted something between a point-and-shoot into DSLR. This fits the bill. 
4697 3 Nice little kit. its obviously cheap and the the brushes may loose a hair inside your camera from time to time so double check it before you start shooting but otherwise im really happy with it. im not a pro photographer. 
4698 4 Nifty camera. Great outdoor solution. FREE online storage is a huge plus. Easy setup and surprisingly good battery life. Likely to buy another. 
4699 3 Money value package 
4700 3 works well for a novice 
4701 4 Excellent value at twice the price. Equal to, if not superior in quality and functionality to the camera float manufactured by Olympus. 
4702 4 Product came as described with all parts in tact. They are fairly sturdy and seem to do a good job. 
4703 4 Bought this product for my grandson to anchor his gopro to boat motor and it worked great. 
4704 4 Ball head fully met expectations; it held the camera very securely - could saftly walk with the tripod with the camera locked in place. was easy to adjust, with a time and coarse adjustment capability and scanned smppthly. Nice small size and light weight, 
4705 4 works as advertised. 
4706 2 Film in pack didn t always result in good picture. Not sure if it was user error and we exposed film because first picture turned out great. 
4707 2 This product met advertised specifications and was promptly shipped. However I would recommend spending additional money for brass rings to prevent sticking threads. 
4708 4 The NIKON LensPen Lens Cleaner works as described, so I am happy with my purchase. 
4709 4 Wonderful protection, light weight, good harness. 
4710 4 Came exactly as said and about 2$ cheaper than if I bought it at a store, so I guess it s worth it 
4711 3 love this camera, battery does seem to lose charge fast. 
4712 4 On the Nikon J4, the minimal focal distance is closer to a 50mm lens. I love this lens. I intended to upgrade to a full DSLR, but, my J4 is awesome with this lens and the FT1 adapter. 
4713 4 Accurate reading. Cheap, does what it should 
4714 3 Nice cover. Fits the A6000 well. I d love a belt strap, but this is a good cover for saving the camera from small dings and dirt. 
4715 4 Looks great, works great. Not the fastest lens or lowest F-stop, but pictures are clear and focus is quick enough for money spent. 
4716 4 Great! 
4717 4 satisfied with the order. the product was exactly as it was described. 
4718 0 Swivel section will not turn more than a few degrees! Had to move the whole unit to video. 
4719 4 Just what I was needing for my gimbal 
4720 4 worked great.....the same as nikon battery. 
4721 4 Item works great and arrived in a timely matter! 
4722 4 These seem to work fine. I can t comment on whether they last as long as the original battery. they seem to last a long time. 
4723 4 The Sony battery is exactly as advertised. Thank you! 
4724 4 It works perfectly. I really liked being able just to put the battery into the camera without having to power it up first. 
4725 4 I m a wedding videographer and this is a must have!! 
4726 0 Not user friendly and the owners manual is worthless. Find another product that is easier to use and more reliable. 
4727 4 Bought this Hood for my Canon EOS T5i with 18-135mm lens and fits perfectly! Very good quality item! 
4728 3 Great gear for use. 
4729 4 Perfect, controls my 560III s power levels remotely. Superb portable lighting setup. 
4730 4 Quality product. Fast shipping. For Fujifilm XP80 fit. 
4731 4 Love them, 2nd pair I have owned 
4732 4 Order arrived as stated on the site; the cameras are great - we are very happy. 
4733 3 Yes I still do Polaroids 
4734 2 One of the bulbs was not working. 
4735 4 It s a flash stand. Therefore, you stick a flash in it and it stands. Done. 
4736 4 One, two three, I had my cable and it fit perfectly. 
4737 0 Smaller than advertised :( 
4738 4 Great quality and is definitely an upgrade from the stock screws. Don t think i ll ever use the stock ones again and will slowly replace all my plastic ones with these. 
4739 4 Love it 
4740 3 It charged the battery. 
4741 3 Not pro quality or durability, but it gets the job done and works well. The reversal cover is a nice solve to the problem of needing to bring several reflectors to a shoot. 
4742 4 Delivered as advertised. 
4743 4 Exactly as needed. 
4744 1 I still have been able to get it to work 
4745 4 very good quality and very good prices 
4746 4 Works great 
4747 4 Very pleased 
4748 0 Didn t work. Manual had instructions for a different model. Honestly, I wish I had just spent the extra few dollars for a decent one 
4749 0 heavy, flat look at objects 
4750 4 Perfect. Brought my camera back to life. 
4751 2 Easy to use but battery died on me pretty quickly although I hardly used it. Also never learned all its features, my God, why do they put so many features on it. 
4752 3 Easy to install and works well. You do have to hit # after your code in order to unlock, which is slightly annoying. 
4753 4 Worked great, easy to install. Great communication. 
4754 2 Just fits the front of the SB600 but don t stay on..must tape it to keep it from falling off 
4755 4 Pretty decent monopod, locks function properly, lightweight, stable enough for a Canon Vixia hf 400r camcorder. Not sure if it is up to professional standards but the fluid head pans and tilts smoothly with no discernible drag. Construction and materials are up to par for the price. 
4756 4 Lena works perfectly for selfies! Couldn t be happier and it snaps on and off seamlessly 
4757 4 Setup was very simple and once it s configured (in less than 10 minutes) it s very easy to use with the app and web site. 
4758 4 bob s knobs alwasy good for your telecope. 
4759 3 Wish it was bigger, but it s tough and very high quality. I store 4 light stands and a soft box in it. It can t take any more than that. 
4760 4 It s a great product at a great price. I love the bubble levels and the height adjustability. 
4761 4 I loved this camera and it is a very good one and i think some of you should but it 
4762 4 Arrived on time. Great package. Some of the items were not really needed, but I am very pleased with the whole transaction. The camera is a great camera for an amateur photographer. I really like the size. I also ordered a 50mm lens for the camera. Have everything I need. 
4763 4 Worked exactly as expected 
4764 4 Quality exceeded expectations that were based on price. 
4765 2 Cool 
4766 4 Nice case, fits well. Product arrived sooner than expected. 
4767 4 Fit the lens it was purchased for, seems okay. No distortions. 
4768 4 Very cool product. I am pleased with my purchase. 
4769 4 It is good product 
4770 4 Lens works well.. makes reds pop out..Awesome 
4771 4 Sets a role model for how flexible gymnasts must be to make it to the top 
4772 4 Works great 
4773 4 Package came a little damaged and sealed with tape, but product was in good condition. It works fine. Level indicator is a little weak. 
4774 0 The logo does not look like what it shows in the picture!!!! Instead of the embroidered letters, it s actually an ugly piece of black rubber attached onto the bag. :( 
4775 4 AAAA 
4776 3 Great value. Perfect for teenage grandson. Holding up well. He lives it. 
4777 4 Great lens very sharp and fast and I love it! Quality feeling and quality look. Worth every penny. Very happy I purchased this lens 
4778 4 Met my expectations. 
4779 0 This battery died very quickly on me. 
4780 2 Needs handle bars. 
4781 4 Fit and works great! 
4782 1 This umbrella soft box does not have a white interior as the description claims. That was the only reason I bought this version over the others that are available and it was incorrect. The build quality was fine for the price. 
4783 2 Great for home 
4784 3 Works great, But complicated. Have to read directions often. I don t use it a lot so I forget. 
4785 4 I love the Bella twins poser 
4786 4 Great device extremely helpful in close-up work 
4787 4 Met my expectations 
4788 1 Better than the factory dji box, but you still have to remove the rotors and it bends the RC antennas a little. Also the pockets and zipper storage for the rotors would be too tight and potentially bend them. 
4789 3 nice cap. cheap replacement. 
4790 4 Canon continues to stay on the cutting edge of digital photography, with controls that can be changed on-the-fly while in use. 
4791 2 two details of this tripod that I do not like: the minimum length is too long, the 2 release handles (for the quick release plate) are a little too stiff. 
4792 4 Fine 
4793 4 This was a great first lighting kit for me. The quality of the items were great and its a very easy and quick set up and take down with great carrying cases. 
4794 4 Arrived as expected and was in good condition. 
4795 4 No problems. Very accurate description 
4796 4 Great quality. Better than Nikon 
4797 0 The cameras have only been up a little over a week now and two out of four no longer even work. Is this set of security cameras junk? I paid an additional $100 to have them mounted on the outside. And I am out a lot of money now. 
4798 2 At full optical zoom the image starts to get blurrier. 
4799 4 LOVE IT 
4800 4 i had the instax mini 8 and was fed up with the over or under exposure that happened too much! this one enables much more control on how the photo turns out! love learning all the cool functions and modes! 
4801 4 while I have only used the camera for a few weeks and still learning I have noticed improved speed and sharp pictures. 
4802 4 Great charger! 
4803 4 Wifes rebel t3 fits nicely. 
4804 2 Only helpfull if you use them. But reading them they are full of good info. 
4805 4 This bag is beautiful and holds a mirror less camera, four lenses, batteries, filters and memory cards. Truly amazing for its size. 
4806 0 Would not fit my camera. Should have read reviews before ordering. 
4807 4 i love this flash! adds such good dynamic lighting 
4808 4 These work great in the woman s locker room at my health club. 
4809 4 Awesome bag, the quality is high and the design is awesome. if you love old school stuff :) 
4810 3 Fast shipping, nice flash, awesome speed light. 
4811 4 I like the head mount better for what I am using it for (tracking with my dog, and nosework) but it is very adjustable and another tool to use with the GoPro :) 
4812 4 Love love love the bag! I couldn t be happier with my purchase! The bag has plenty of room for my camera and everything else I usually carry in my purse! 
4813 4 Nice products! 
4814 4 Easy to use camera. Quality pictures & simple directions 
4815 0 It okay the press button does work to good 
4816 4 The camera is great, all in perfect conditions! 
4817 0 it doesn t last and it gets hot 
4818 1 I purchased these to use on a Galaxy S6 and was disappointed, the clip did not fit well and the Macro only seemed to come into focus if the object was about 0.50&#34; so I returned them. 
4819 4 This is well made and I use it alot, I carry it everwhere with me because I take my camera everywhere with me and it has stood up to my goings. 
4820 4 The treading is a bit rough but it definitely gets the job done. 
4821 4 Look very official. Can only be seen on clear windows as they stick on the inside of window. 
4822 4 Henry i want to say that Mr. Henry was very helpful he installed my cam in it didn t take him a long time i want to say thank you for all your help in doing so 
4823 4 PRICE WAS FAIR AND QUALITY IS EXCELLENT..NO LEAK S AND SIMPLE TO USE... 
4824 4 It works great even under water 
4825 4 Muy buen producto 
4826 4 Works perfectly! 
4827 3 Super fun camera! Captures great sunsets and dogs running on the beach with great detail. Looking forward to getting additional lenses! 
4828 0 None of the pictures came out. They were too dark. 
4829 4 If you are considering purchasing a digital frame, this is the one to buy! My pictures look fabulous. I will be purchasing additional frames for myself and for gifts. 
4830 4 Love it! Nice to handle and work photos! 
4831 4 If you think about getting a tripod for your camera? This is the perfect one! Very light, user friendly, and i just love the design. I didn t have to read the manual, it s that easy to use. 
4832 4 I have more bags than you can count. Always looking for the best camera bag. It has not be made as yet. However, this is the best bag I found for the micro 4/3 camera and three lens. Love it. My favorite bag. 
4833 4 I bought the 16 inch one and the 10 inch one. Very protective, but also very thick. I like the fact that I can wrap my lenses up as a burrito or a baby, hahaha. 
4834 4 Works well when taking group picture! 
4835 4 Fantastic !! 
4836 4 I received the item in a well protected box. The battery grip comes with instructions in English. I am very pleased with the grip. Function keys work perfectly for my Rebel XSI. I would recommend this grip. Feels solid on my camera. 
4837 4 Exactly as expected. Never had a problem switching lenses, comes off and goes on with out a problem. Came quickly, very satisfied with purchase! 
4838 4 Worked well when i owned Cannon 
4839 4 Great product at a great price. 
4840 4 Works great 
4841 4 I really like how the camera works 
4842 4 Great kit highly recommend. 
4843 4 Useful 
4844 4 Works just like the original.... Kept my GoPro attached to my motorcycle fender from San Frandisco to Portland and Back! 
4845 4 It s a camera case, and a good one. Fit my waterproof Fuji camera really well and feels as though it provides excellent protection for my camera. What s not to like? 
4846 2 Tried to revive my flip ultra that won t charge...still won t charge. Not the battery s fault..I guess. Too bad, it took great pictures, but too expensive to replace. Will go back to using my camera phone. 
4847 4 compact and easy to store, easy to use. 
4848 4 Great Binoculars for the price. They can be hard to hold steady in your hands. 
4849 4 Awesome! 
4850 4 These hold a charge as well as the Fuji X-t1 battery, and maybe a little better. It turns off when fully charged and will hold its charge for many days unused. 
4851 0 Not impressed, already the large thumbscrew has strip out. The quality is very questionable which is my reason for one star. 
4852 3 It does the job ... However, build quality is not as good as it should be 
4853 1 Better stay off it unless u have all day time and a dead specimen to click. 
4854 0 Not that much good quality video 
4855 4 really handy charger convent battery holds good charge 
4856 4 Good product. 
4857 3 good 
4858 4 This item fits perfectly. They are a great, affordable alternative. 
4859 2 Nice strapt but without enough flotation for maintain coolpix AW130 on the water level, you need to add an small flotation block 
4860 3 Wish the batteries last longer. At 2 and a half months the battery reached the red. Still an awesome device for home security. 
4861 4 Very clear picture. Works great! Set-up was a breeze. Had tried other cameras before and the set-up was terrible, so bad I never used them! 
4862 3 I got this thinking it would work to start and stop video, but it works only as a shutter for the still camera. 
4863 4 This camera case can carry all of my equipment to a crime scene. I also like the fact that it s water proof (more so than my other bag was) and that I have everything in one place. 
4864 4 Enjoyed using this lens on vacation. Used it for landscape as well as astrophotography. 
4865 3 Everything has been great.. Pleasure to use! 
4866 4 As i expected. 
4867 4 Thank you! 
4868 4 Using now and they work great and hold as good a charge as my original. 
4869 4 Battery charger works well. No complaints. 
4870 4 haven t had a chance to use yet but everything looks fine 
4871 4 I have used this type device before and paid 3x as much for one that is no better, if not as good. Really makes a difference in the grip and ability to steady the camera. NICE! 
4872 3 This microphone worked really well for General sound on my short films and videos. 
4873 4 The selfie stick works awesome. Not quite as long as i expected but has a great battery life. The seller was very easy to work with and 10/10 would buy from them again 
4874 2 Nice Point and Shoot Digital Camera, but the battery runs out pretty quickly! 
4875 4 i love using these with my instant camera. especially when i take photos of my 3 year old, she loves seeing the photos come out on the disney film 
4876 4 This was great! Looks like the real thing. 
4877 4 I love it! It s exactly what I was looking for! 
4878 3 Batery life is 45 minutes 
4879 4 a little expensive but works great 
4880 1 Horrible quality. Get a better camera. 
4881 3 I wanted one of the clips shown in original picture but what I saw and what I received were 1 piece different. No other issues! 
4882 3 I like it and am enjoying it for the purpose I bought this for... I ll be back for more, it works amazingly well! 
4883 4 good to have it... 
4884 4 Works as advertised! Not much more to say than that! 
4885 4 Everything fit my SONY, great price too! Everything is still working after three vacations! 
4886 3 Works Great !! 
4887 4 Great Thank you. 
4888 4 Works great! ! Camera I just bought didn t have one. I like to keep the flash connection clean and damage free. 
4889 4 Perfect!!! 
4890 3 Extremely fast service, got it in one piece. ** Only one situation. The ilustration (as shown)and as per description, the &#34;The Tripod adapter&#34; Base is incomplete or missing. 
4891 4 Thank you 
4892 2 It s a cool grip but the camera feels a little unbalanced when it s on. 
4893 4 The batteries worked just fine,in the camera and the charger.Thank you. 
4894 3 Fantastic. Will be buying many more. Only gripe I have is that the base plate doesn t have the larger thread option. Really wish it was there. 
4895 4 Just as advertised. 
4896 4 excellent 
4897 4 A must for any one camping and good for everyday use. 
4898 4 Awesome, if u r a little girl 
4899 4 It works as Intended and right on time 
4900 0 Bought one along With the camera but the lens cover on the case was cracked and felling apart Just by taking it off the bag, by mistake I bought two cases and the other one was fine but Im second guessing on submerging this case With the camera incide 
4901 1 not user friendly 
4902 3 I really liked this camera though it is not advanced as others I have owned in the past, For the price, it gets the job done. 
4903 4 Product was in great condition(new) and worked out great 
4904 3 Nice 
4905 4 Works as advertised charging my Sony Camcorder NP-F330 battery 
4906 4 Great camera, amazing pictures, easy to use, awesome zoom and incredible quality product 
4907 4 Not as expected. I thought from picture it would be a dual charger. It isn t. 
4908 4 very portable! 
4909 4 Excellent camera, service was great and help me set up in minutes. App makes the camera useful and mobile. 
4910 4 Delivered as advertised and works great 
4911 4 Nice product and delivered on time. 
4912 4 Gave as a gift to my daughter. She is very pleased 
4913 4 Great Item! Would buy again. Did not disappoint. 
4914 3 I m very pleased with my tripod came a lot faster than I thought. It s a lil flimsy but you get what you pay for I m satisfied over all 
4915 3 Perfect fit arrived a day early. Thank u. 
4916 4 Seems sturdy and easy to use! Take the time to learn the menus for ease of changing settings on the go! 
4917 0 It is too small for my Nikon D3000 
4918 0 I ve had nothing but problems with it, from the wheels falling off, to the knobs not holding their position to an unfixable wobble, the problems are endless. Invest in something better than this, you ll be glad you did. 
4919 4 Absolutely the best! I only put B+W on my lenses. So clear sometimes it appears like there is no glass in the frame. The slim profile is perfect for the Olympus 12mm wide. Plenty of groove up front for a lens cap. 
4920 1 Too much distortion, even after you set the Lens Conversion setting. This is true for both the wide angle and the telephoto. The telephoto is worse, though. You re better off just spending more money on a better attachment. 
4921 4 Everything you d want and more! 
4922 0 My old worn out battery holds better charge that this new one... I don t recommend it. 
4923 3 Needs to be plugged in to charger to use auto feature. Also very sensitive to the touch, it falls off holder when I go to unplug it. Other than that it does its job! 
4924 4 Great,thanks 
4925 2 Takes alright pictures...just takes what feels like &#34;a few seconds&#34; between each shot. So, can t take rapid pictures. 
4926 4 Great add-on for a product. Excellent shipping, and no issues. 
4927 4 Affordable and handy. Very sturdy build. Worth the money. 
4928 4 Just bought this camera a couple of weeks ago for a really good price. I m really Stocked with the camera and everything that came with it. The shipping was great. Thanks a lot! 
4929 0 Did not come as pictured. Connectors are female to RCA, not female to female 
4930 0 Don t bother with these. They fall apart and are easily lost. My husband lost 2 in 2 days. Money down the drain. Buy better ones. 
4931 4 So far, so good! Does exactly what I wanted. 
4932 3 I had bought this alongside my RF Explorer because I figured it was something special for the unit. It is a fine case for it, but its nothing different than a generic hard drive like case. 
4933 4 quality is good enough for indoor use. 
4934 3 Good 
4935 4 Excellent service from Calvin in helping setup. Camera is great 
4936 4 I ve owned two of this lens and it is my favorite I have ever had. Everything is perfect. Sharp!!!!! 
4937 4 Working good so far Don t know in the future 
4938 4 Great product. 
4939 4 An amazing camera with an amazing auto focus and built quality. Image quality is what you payed for. No more to say. 
4940 4 Pleased with product performance, soft yet durable with multiple functionality options at a super great price. Glad I bought it! 
4941 3 It works alright. Little bulky.. Not as much room as indicated by pictures and other user reviews. Decent for a casual day of shooting, but doesn t hold all I d like it after reading the reviews 
4942 3 Perfect was what i need 
4943 3 Great for keeping a your Gopro equipment safe and orderly. Would recommend. 
4944 4 Everything Works Great 
4945 0 Screen became washed out after 40 days. 
4946 4 Works great. 
4947 4 This lens is well worth the price of admission. It is fast and sharp. It is great for shooting sports. It is very heavy, so expect a workout when you shoot. 
4948 4 Great video quality, and works really well with my iphone 6. Love the ease of viewing. 
4949 4 Simple and effective! 
4950 4 Easy setup, works great. 
4951 4 It works!! I like it! 
4952 4 Glad I found this for the price,works great .. 
4953 4 Battery arrived in time and is working beautifully 
4954 4 love having an extra battery when traveling 
4955 4 Product was as advertised. 
4956 4 True to what it is and how it is advertised. Love having an extra battery; keeps the charge just as long as the battery that came with my nikon dslr. 
4957 4 Lost my old cord - works great. 
4958 4 Compact, well made, will be taking them to our Yellowstone park trip next month. 
4959 4 A little pricey but works geeat 
4960 4 Gave this as a gift. Friend loved it. Uploading and ease of use is wonderful. Nice large screen. She likes to display four photos on each screen view. Would definitely buy again. 
4961 1 Lena cap does not fit hood 
4962 4 Same color as described. Great thick quality as usual 
4963 4 This was a great tripod for the price range. Just high enough that you can film people with the camera at face level. Very easy to use, no complaints at all! 
4964 3 Not as cheap as sony but still good 
4965 3 Camera works as advertised, wish the mounting bracket was better designed so I can attach it to the eve versus having to mount to wall, other then that works very good, great night vision, field of view is better then most others I have tried 
4966 4 Love the caamera and the picss. 
4967 3 I like it 
4968 4 great value, thanks for the deal 
4969 4 Love the camera but the accessories are junk. 
4970 4 Great product, I use it on my seadoo spark. 
4971 1 The product comes in Chinese letters and could not figure out how to put it into english. 
4972 4 Great lens!!! 
4973 4 good product 
4974 4 Just what I expected 
4975 4 great price fast shipping 
4976 1 Great bag, too small for 9900. returned bag 
4977 2 has very short sensing range 
4978 4 Nice 
4979 4 Nice color 
4980 4 Great product! exactly what I needed. 
4981 4 Just like the original. perfect fit. easy pluck. used it to reconfigure the case for my camera and lenses. 
4982 4 good designer, good quality, and easy to use 
4983 4 great 
4984 4 This lens is very good its not a wide angle .but works well for phot and video on my DSLR 
4985 4 Works perfectly for when I need flash harsh light diffused. Great price! 
4986 4 Great Battery 
4987 4 very happy with my purchase! 
4988 4 Product was as advertised. 
4989 4 Thanks 
4990 4 for a motorcycle rider it is far superior compared to the competition. The video and audio is clear and after 6 months of use has been flawless in use after hundreds of hours of recording on a daily use. 
4991 3 I like this camera and have gotten several compliments on it, some due to the red color which makes it unique. My only problem is that you have to turn the camera off , and then on again if you turn it on before removing the lens cap. 
4992 1 Low Quality Gives cameras a rainbow on the screen 
4993 2 Works fine. Not enlarge enough and not bright enough. 
4994 4 Fine product. 
4995 4 Good price/delivered right on time!! Work s well!! 
4996 3 Good purchase and overall quality.... I would prefer if the joints remained stiff over the life of the tripod... but it s not bad! 
4997 1 The camera is good but the rest of the assessories are garbage. The batteries on the battery charger wont charge. The cleaning solution was open and everything on the inside of the bag was wrecked so I had to be thrown away. 
4998 4 Great walk around lens. Takes decent portraits. One of my favorite lenses. Does a good job with indoor photos. Excells outdoors! Great price for an L glass! A must have for any collection. 
4999 4 Very good! Works great! 
5000 0 Returned 
5001 4 Great product and will purchase again. 
5002 2 Didn t meet my expectations, couldn t charge battery 100%,mostly 85% to 90% only. 
5003 3 lens cap is great so far. I tried an attachment ring for the first time. It moved and caused my camera lanes to jam causing an error code, and then it fell apart. But I bought it for the lens cap, not the attachment. I could do without those. 
5004 3 Hard to install on a verizon system. The night vision requires a bright light. The picture however is excellent. 
5005 4 Excellent! 
5006 4 This case provides great storage and travels great for my Sony Digital SLR. Lots of pockets and is made of good quality. 
5007 2 Works fine I like it 
5008 4 Love it! Wish I had bought it sooner. 
5009 4 Worked perfectly. Looks identical to the Sony original at a fraction of the price 
5010 4 Ok 
5011 4 My daughter loved it!! So happy with it 
5012 4 Easy to use, perfect for our needs 
5013 4 I am enjoying to see my cats in my house while I am working at my office. 
5014 3 Fine for the price but does not have a tripod mount as the description implies. 
5015 0 To hard to get loaded on pc , light weight and moves around to much on your face and you can t tell if you are recording or not 
5016 4 Great product. Fast shipping. Secure packing. Exactly as described. Thank you! 
5017 3 a little short, shorther then the factory one, it it was 10 inches longer this would be a hit. 
5018 2 First one fell apart So far the replacement is fine Easy return process, with no problems 
5019 0 This product is a piece of crap I tried to get my money back but they never responed 
5020 4 Very helpful item,thank you very much 
5021 1 the backpack does look like the one is the picture doesn t say DJI on it disappointed 
5022 4 after reading all the reviews, I elected to buy this lcd cover (I m too clumsy not to scratch things). Easiest application ever, perfect fit - looks like part of the camera. Doesn t obscure screen at all. Very happy with purchase! 
5023 4 For the price, it exceeded my expectations. 
5024 3 Just as described. 
5025 4 Super high-quality polarizer filter. I like the great thin construction of the filter, the color cast isn t too blue either. Breakthrough also stands by their products. If you want to step in from Tiffen and Hoya, try out Breakthrough filters. 
5026 4 Super convenient and as such you ll likely have it when you desperately need it (as I ve found) 
5027 4 excelente 
5028 4 We bought this to fit our Nikon COOLPIX P600 16.1 MP Wi-Fi CMOS Digital Camera with 60x Zoom NIKKOR Lens and Full HD 1080p Video Works great, no complaints. 
5029 4 Quick turn around. Great product, fantastic price. 
5030 4 I love it. 
5031 4 This is a great bag. Seems well built. And for a camera bag it s probably just right. I m using it as a messenger bag for work. As such, having some more organization would be helpful (pen slots, interior pockets, etc) but ice made sure by accessorizing. 
5032 4 Easy to use, not too heavy, and I like the document flap in the front inside cover. 
5033 0 Junk. Brand new and don t hold a charge. 
5034 4 Compact, but amazing little camera. Great zoom capabilities. Love it! 
5035 2 It s okay, but nothing to write home about. 
5036 4 Works as expected and no complaints from me. I will update my review should that change. 
5037 4 Great service, delivered precisely as stated. Thanks. 
5038 2 Works as described but the remote control switch felt cheap and felt like it would not hold up over time. 
5039 4 works as described. 
5040 4 Works really well, batteries seem to last just as long as the original gopro battery. Charger works great as well even with all three batteries charging simultaneously. 
5041 4 For the price you cant beat it not to mention the looks, its preety good 
5042 4 Looks and works great 
5043 4 awesome bag 
5044 3 My friend told me I do not need to worry about the battery cause it does last long. But it s OK. 
5045 4 Perfect!!! 
5046 4 Great camera. I use it outside of my home and it s got the clearest image of any camera I ve used. I have is recording constantly to a nas and it has worked flawlessly. I highly recommend it. 
5047 4 Excellent strap. I really like the fact that the strap is detachable via a click button and swappable with a normal non floating cord for everyday use. The regular strap came with the two pack. Strap is very buoyant in the water. 
5048 3 good cap cheap replacement. 
5049 4 Just as expected and fast delivery 
5050 4 Very versatile and did what was expected. I am really amazed at the quality you get for the price. Great value! 
5051 4 This works perfectly for in-studio shoots. A heavier version is better for outdoor shoots or if using heavy backdrops. 
5052 4 More then enough light at an exceptional price! 
5053 4 My Canon Powershot SX710 fits perfectly in this - with room for extra batteries. It is small enough that I can put it in my purse so my camera is with me all the time. It is a quality product. 
5054 4 Awesome 
5055 4 Very good results. Totally satisfied... 
5056 4 Excellent buy. 
5057 4 They are what they seem to be. Very large, easy to store and they get the job done... oh yeah and they are priced right. 
5058 4 great product 
5059 4 The best value with the lowest cost per photo - I ll never run out or miss the perfect shot! 
5060 1 I m not a camera person...not what I expected... 
5061 3 Pretty nice camera for what I paid 
5062 2 Only worked for 7 months. 
5063 4 I was surprised how well constructed this was. I mean good zippers and all. I feel you really get your moneys worth. 
5064 4 Got this as a present for my parents and they LOVE it!! 
5065 4 great product 
5066 3 It s a very nice Len very solid but it doesn t work that great with the A7ii. 
5067 4 Great product. 
5068 4 Camera works great and Henry at Foscam did the install. Henry was tremendous -- patient, professional and helpful. Kudos to all! 
5069 4 This is a great product!!! 
5070 0 absolute trash 
5071 4 Great buy, great item, works 100% every time in all modes... 
5072 4 Great little camera! 
5073 0 I received this and wanted to charge the battery for my son. It didn t charge, I don t know whether the battery is bad or the actual charger. :( 
5074 4 Perfect! 
5075 4 Excelente product. Amaing zoom. 
5076 0 LEAVE ME ALONE! 
5077 2 my daughter loves this- was her Bithday gift. my only concern is it will be outdated in no time .too expensive for what is about to come to market 
5078 2 came in black, but i like that better than the grey. no sealed pockets for memory cards and spare batteries though. 
5079 4 So far its being great 
5080 4 Arrived promptly and as described. 
5081 2 Not bad. 
5082 1 Not good for all cameras listed. The case included is tiny. 
5083 4 Henry Thanks again for helping me set up my 2 cameras again. These are great cameras and the only drawback is I need to buy more. I highly recommend these cameras as well as the tech support provided by Henry and the Foscam team.. 
5084 4 Received my product very quickly from the seller. Thanks!! The film was perfect and the price was PERFECT!! 
5085 4 Love it it is great! I m using it with Canon Pima IP110 and while slightly large, it works well!!! 
5086 4 Everything worked perfectly. Very satisfied. e 
5087 4 Exelente 
5088 3 Good quality mount for smaller diameter bars. 
5089 0 Returned for refund as they were not genuine GoPro items, as advertised. All of the other items I purchased WERE genuine. 
5090 4 All is perfect 
5091 0 trash!!!!!! original battery with 1030mAh working in two times longer than this batteries with 2300 mAh 
5092 4 Works good. Delivered in time. 
5093 4 Great 
5094 4 The glass was very nice. I just used them a couple of times but looking forward to playing! 
5095 4 all good; great value and great product. 
5096 0 The battery is listed as DMW-BCF10PP but i received BCF-10E which is a different voltage and mAH rating so i had to return it. 
5097 4 Works well. I have been a max of 10 feet away so far, and I have yet to have trouble. This is DEFINITELY worth the buy. 
5098 2 very clear, you need a tripod for steady viewing 
5099 4 charge up fast, work great, don t heat up while it is being charged up, holds charge really good 
5100 4 Excellent item 
5101 4 Love it! Arrived fast ! 
5102 4 very good！ 
5103 4 Perfect way to hold my camera! love it way more than a neck strap, and it looks cool and kind vintage! 
5104 4 Looks good. Wife really loved it! 
5105 3 gets the job done. 
5106 4 My daughter enjoys taking pictures. 
5107 4 Works great 
5108 0 don t buy it !!!!!! went up smoke !!!!!!!!!! 
5109 2 I m not pleased with the color of the pictures it takes. 
5110 4 Really love this camera! It has been a great upgrade for me. I use it for interior real estate photography as well nature and family photography. 
5111 3 Got it the next day COOL a swivel to point the camera forward be handy 
5112 4 Love the Glass. Extremely sharp when stopped down to 8.0. It is solid and goes great with a full frame body. 
5113 4 Works! 
5114 4 Great product! Was as described and received item in a very timely manner. 
5115 0 The LEDs are grossly underpowered. It wont even light up an area 10 feet away. I m sorry I bought it. Used to sell for over a hundred dollars? Baloney! 
5116 4 works, gets the job done 
5117 4 High quality, best cleaning pad I ever had 
5118 2 compared to what plastic components for the GoPro are going for, the price on this item seemed steep. my suggestion is that if you have this component, don t lose it. otherwise, it does what it s supposed to do. 
5119 4 Awesome product, easy to assemble and use. 
5120 4 Did some shots of the Milky Way here in New Mexico and they came out better than I expected. So far I m really impressed with this lens. 
5121 4 Good package deal, easy to fly, lots of fun 
5122 1 It s nice enough but it keeps corrupting the USB stick that stores the photos. I ve had to reload the USB several times now. 
5123 3 One of the last viewfinder cameras. Takes great pictures when you allow sufficient time for it to focus. 
5124 4 Love my Foldio! I use it to take pictures for my esty shop. They turn out well lit and with a nice uniform background. It is also very convent since its not that big and can be folded up to taken on the go. 
5125 2 I like this camera, nice size to fit into your pocket. Got some amazing photos at a concert. The zoom made it seem like we were right up front. 
5126 3 I love the device. Only wish is that it sat high enough when facing myself from a low angle that the hardware was not visible in shot. 
5127 4 Very good I would recommend the sky master. 
5128 3 Great price! heavy though. 
5129 3 Only complaint, battery life should be better, drains to quickly when recording video. Good for simplicity, but battery, MEH! Wifi turned on and battery really tanks pretty quick. picture quality is good for the price, audio not it s finest feature. iPhone app, kind of sucks and crashes a lot. 
5130 0 Fake toy, None of the sensors were accurate, not even close. 
5131 4 exelent! 
5132 3 Works great 
5133 4 We have loved this easy to use camera. 
5134 3 good price and product. 
5135 4 Works great and Good price 
5136 4 I was skeptical at first when I ordered this, but was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this item. Very satisfied so far. 
5137 3 While these batteries are not the best build quality as the original GoPro batteries, they last quite as long as the Original batteries. And for throw away prices, you wouldnt regret a bit. Go for it! 
5138 4 Cheap but works. 
5139 3 Returned, it did not fit. Seemed to be made as well as any others I have seen. 
5140 4 works perfectly with my a6000 
5141 4 This hood is perfect, fit and finish very good, always satisfied buying from this seller 
5142 4 great item, will buy again for my 2nd a6000 
5143 4 Works as advertised for Canon 7d Mark 2 
5144 4 this is my 3rd time buying for my friends same product. 
5145 4 LOVE THIS MOUNT SO MUCH!!!!! customer service is incredible. no problems with shipping. cant wait to try it out 
5146 4 nice case 
5147 4 Worked as advertised. 
5148 4 Works! 
5149 4 A little bulky for what it does (remote camera shutter, flash) but works as stated from any position. 
5150 2 I couldn t find all his potential use yet. I m trying to find special situations to use it. 
5151 2 Memory Card not included in the box. You need to buy one separately or the camera will not work. Also, the &#34;Must Have&#34; accessory kit is not needed. Other than the camera case, all other items come with camera or are superfluous. 
5152 4 It s all good. 
5153 4 A 
5154 4 It does the job. I love the lcd screen. Why pay over 400 when u can get this camera 
5155 4 Ghhg 
5156 4 great product......super fast delivery 
5157 2 works ok 
5158 4 Works great. I love that I can use this with the wrist guard or without. I like having to be able to take a picture one handed and still have my camera secure. Great purchase! 
5159 4 Its so great that its good in capturing those moments other consider as hard to capture 
5160 4 Great birthday as birthday gift or special occasion. The girlfriend loves it, and is super satisfied with the picture quality. 
5161 4 Excellent- I put it on my Sony night shot and can see and record 30-40 ft farther than without ity. 
5162 4 Very good quality, perfect fit, and superb aesthetic. Well worth the price. The supplier also sent me a complementary wrist strap of equally good quality. 
5163 4 The ones shipped with camera go out around 1.5 years. I have 6 cameras and have had to replace 3. Hope this lasts a little longer.... 
5164 4 It fits as advertised, seems to be of high quality and is made in OH. What more can I say! However, I have not crashed my Phantom 3 since I installed it, which is also a good thing. 
5165 4 Bought this for my daughter for a birthday present and she loves it! 
5166 0 I bought this for nikkon p900.. But it too small to store it.. 
5167 4 I could not find the cable that came with OLY OMD M1 camera and I did not want to pay OLY s price and this one seems to work perfectly. 
5168 0 The box was opened and the backdrop was wet and mildewed. I had to wash it when I got it. I should have returned it but I took to long. 
5169 3 The control board works great. Didn t need the new housing. 
5170 2 Could be more helpful for setting them up. No help at all from anyone.. 
5171 4 Works with t1i. 
5172 4 Nice. Keep an eye on the knob attached to the camera, it does work itself loose. 
5173 4 Love how you can use it with one hand. 
5174 4 Nice product. Good value. 
5175 4 Great product 
5176 4 Good product ! 
5177 0 It didn t work w any of my lighting 
5178 3 Great for wedding pictures. Holds lots of 4x6 pictures. 
5179 2 The cables were not long enough and my mouse was cracked once received, which made me have to purchase a new mouse and longer cables. Also the instructions were not very detailed and very limited. Picture quality is good. 
5180 4 Excellent 
5181 4 fits & works... what more? 
5182 4 Perfect replacement for a lost charger 
5183 4 Exceptional. Very comfortable. As described. Hand slides in, able operate camera and easy out. Secure. 
5184 4 Love it! It worked perfectly. One thing to be aware of, it completely overrides your camera s controls when plugged in to a remote trigger (i.e. pocket wizard), so you must unplug it to adjust exposure, focus, etc., then plug it back in. 
5185 4 Excellent! 
5186 4 Very nice point and shoot camera! Love how small it is so it can fit in my clutch! 
5187 4 Came in very quick. I love how everything was in it s individual packages. I have two lens, on 18-55mm and on 75-250mm, and this actually works for both! 
5188 4 As described. Wery good 
5189 4 fits perfect on my girlfriends Fuji xe2 kit lens. 
5190 4 Love these and easy to use. 
5191 4 Very nice outfit. Easy way to just jump right in and have everything you need to get your feet wet. 
5192 2 product was not one continuous printed sheet which would have been fine, except there is a very noticeable seam that wasn t properly aligned. Print quality is great, and the material is of good quality, but would have been a much higher rating if the workmanship was better 
5193 3 My daughter loves this camera. Had to replace the SD Card almost immediately, but since then it has worked for her. 
5194 3 I would recommend this slider. 
5195 0 It said right on the box it would not work on the Olympus OMD EM5 which I had purchased it for. 
5196 0 Does not turn on, stuck on intro screen 
5197 2 it s ok 
5198 4 The lens does a great job for us. 
5199 4 Never got to use them, as the Ram Twis-lock suction cup mount that we purchased to mount our GoPro camera with fell off of our Harley, on our way to Sturgis SD, over 4000 miles round trip. 
5200 4 I just wanted something simple but good quality - this one is perfect for me. Easy to use and great quality! 
5201 4 WORKS GREAT 
5202 0 Defective! When plugged it did not even turn on... I m returning this item. 
5203 3 Does what it says - great product, easy to set up. 
5204 3 Thx 
5205 4 Great camera, good deal. Very happy. 
5206 0 The cable didn t fit on my Olympus 1030. 
5207 3 arrived quickly, mounted easily, seems much better than the spotter scope which came with the telescope 
5208 4 Nice, works well with my camers 
5209 4 Worked Perfectly in my old SONY MVC-FD200. Charger even recharged the old (10 yr) Li-on battery that came with the camera. Highly Recommend. 
5210 4 Works perfectly. 
5211 4 Love it! 
5212 4 Great condition, works perfectly! My pictures have all come out fantastically. No complaints. 
5213 4 nice construction and quality better than expected for the price 
5214 4 Great lens!!! 
5215 4 Good value! 
5216 3 Very cool little add on, they work great, they re light durable and easy to pack around! I d say the perfect solution if don t want to get a real flash extension! 
5217 4 Amazing light for the money, the battery pack is pretty reliable and last as described. 
5218 4 Great product! 
5219 4 Light weight easy to use, this is my 3rd GoPro 
5220 4 Love it! 
5221 4 Love it! 
5222 4 Even better quality then the image depicted. Good tripod for the money. 
5223 4 I love it 
5224 0 I am very happy to get the disposable camera, because I can t find them in a store anymore...Irene 
5225 4 I just love it. Perfect size for my camera and great quality 
5226 3 these do the trick very well, they went on without any trouble J R 
5227 4 This camera met all of my expectations. I used the bicycle mount and recorded my bike ride. I also went swimming with it and got great footage. 
5228 4 My camera did not get scratched at all when I journeyed with it over seas. 
5229 4 It was great and better then I expected! Highly recommend it. 
5230 4 I received the Canon EOS Rebel T6s as promised. The Imaging World shipped it faster than I expected and it was exactly as advertised. 
5231 4 For the size, I really don t think that this stand can be beat. 
5232 4 Everything arrived on time and in clean working order. I had no issues with my photo shoot so I am very happy with my order! Thank you! 
5233 4 Great price, works perfect. 
5234 4 Couldn t have found a better deal. However, will have to return it for a Tab 4. 
5235 4 Very nice Camera and the technical support was outstanding by Richard with Foscam. Had some trouble adding to different devices and they completely walked me through all that was needed to get connected on 3 devices. Very fast answer rate as well. 
5236 4 One of the very coolest electronic items i ve worked with in ages. Priced right to be easily incorporated in any project. 
5237 0 not as good 
5238 4 Excellent batteries. 
5239 4 Good lens I like it fits perfectly on my 60mm fotasy lens adapter on my canon sx50 camera takes get pictures at the beach 
5240 1 The camera works well when the ethernet cable is plugged in but the wireless function is very hard to set up and goes offline several times a day. I don t recommend this unit so keep looking. 
5241 4 Love them! I have better security cameras then stores do. I can see clear and love that I can zoom in on specific areas. Feel much safer! 
5242 2 Not the quality I expected from Sony. Doesn t grip very firmly for an *action* camera. For my use (hiking) I much prefer the no-name camera mounts with spring clips that are much more secure. 
5243 3 The magnet keeps falling off :/ 
5244 4 Thank you :)) 
5245 4 Great product. I m not an over the top go pro accessory kind of person so this is great for me. It would be good for day trips so that you can leave your main go pro box at home 
5246 3 the lighting kit is a wonderful start would buy again would recommend to others 
5247 3 Nice cover piece !! 
5248 3 Nice fitting lens cap 
5249 4 Absolutely exceeded my expectations with syncing to my phone and emailing pictures directly from camera and the front LCD for easy selfies, no selfie stick needed! 
5250 4 Everything arrived on time, great experience. 
5251 4 The x100t button is quite small so this soft release really helps to make it easier to press and reduce camera shake very slightly. I love the look of it too! 
5252 4 This is one easy camera to use. It takes the nicest photos. It is a great camera. The shipping was spot on as well. It is very thin and fits into most pockets with ease. The only thing I would suggest is to add a screen shade on the back. 
5253 4 Love it! & so do all my clients! ☺️ 
5254 4 Great all around camera that takes nice pictures. I use it more than my Canon T3i because of its size and features. 
5255 4 Excellent lens.. 
5256 4 Good product. A+ 
5257 4 Received earlier than expected and works great! 
5258 4 Filter works as advertised. 
5259 0 Miniature camera holder Brooke almost immediately and battery does not charge 
5260 4 Exactly as advertised. I really like this product it seems durable and reliable. I definitely recommend it. 
5261 4 An amazing camera ! I connect it on my iphone 5 and my wife rus it on her Iphone 6! Both work really great as the description ! Easily achieving remote control and video call functions. Super image quality and clear audio. Happy purchased order 
5262 1 The Vixen representative gave me incorrect information about its compatibility for use on my Pentax spotting scope. It cost me shipping and insurance to obtain a full refund. 
5263 4 Really great value at the price! Takes E Mount lenses which I already had so it was an easy decision. I bought it as a backup camera but finding myself using it often. 
5264 4 Does what it says, solid connection to any Cannon D-series camera, works well with my Ralei strobonar with sync cable. 
5265 4 great bag for a great price. 
5266 2 took it out of box and tried to update firmware,now its in repair shop for 8 weeks 
5267 3 Color temp of the lamps are a bit low for what I had hoped for, but switching them for higher K. (more daylight spectrum) and this works well for taking stock photos for our website. 
5268 4 I am used to Axis cameras that cost $700 and up so I was very pleased with the quality of this unit. The night vision is way better than any of the other low end cameras I have tried 
5269 4 Perfect for the little camera we bought. Fits it nice. 
5270 4 Came in earlier than expected. My son loves it. Just wish the battery last longer. And the SD card won t go back in the camera 
5271 4 Does what is says. Good machining. 
5272 3 The product is very compact and seems to work very well. 
5273 4 Exactly what I was hoping for and it arrived quickly. 
5274 3 Takes great pictures easy to understand once you realize that the advance mode takes digital zoom and is mode for choosing reds and rest of picture black and white the advanced mode is awesome 
5275 4 Fantastic product! Best cleaner kit on the market. 
5276 4 Worked perfectly on all my batteries including the ones I thought were faulty, but the charging port on the camera was the root cause. 
5277 4 Fit perfectly! 
5278 4 Seems to be everything it says it is. Still learning, but early trials are very positive. 
5279 4 i love it...as expected 
5280 4 Perfect size! 
5281 4 Works great 
5282 3 I love tgis light. I ve had for at least two years and it still works great! Not a lot of misfires and the output is good if you are working in a small space. 
5283 4 Great value. 
5284 4 Exactly what I was looking for. I have an older Samsung l100 camera without the charger (lost or misplaced it).. This works great! Now my 6yo daughter thinks she s a photographer and loves it! 
5285 4 The price was perfect for what this is. 
5286 4 Nice camera and extras. 
5287 4 Great product, perfect fit for my lens, fast shipment, arriving on time. 
5288 4 Great! 
5289 0 Very week broken with the small bump first one 2 minutes 
5290 4 Great camera for traveling. Great picture quality and easy to use, just need to get used to it. 
5291 4 Awesome lights. Cheap, affordable, and quality. Excellent quality and really gives that daylight white light instead of yellow room light. FREAKING GET IT!!! NOW!! Or later, I mean it s your choice. 
5292 4 Guess it is fine, I just do not know how to see with it. 
5293 3 Good for the price this is all I need for the photos I take. Not professional. 
5294 4 Lemme was confusing at first had to push button on side to open lens to take pictures works great though 
5295 4 excellent! 
5296 2 sorry not much to say it only worked for a couple days,not very well built,the company was very promt. 
5297 0 Time clock didn t work 
5298 4 Works great and would buy it again 
5299 4 The thing works great! I wore it snowboarding and when ur head hits the ground it doesn t break of get damaged! Would recommend it for people that want to wear it during sports!! 
5300 3 One of the bugs had a broken leg piece (it was separated in the acrylic resin) but other than that, LOVED it and so did my little one. 
5301 4 Love this! I wish I d had it sooner! what a peace of mind to keep an eye on my dementia mom! 
5302 4 Fits perfectly. Original Nikon product. 
5303 4 Just what i needed, awesome camera. 
5304 4 It worked grate for my Kodak Z730 Camera. 
5305 0 These are NO good. The thread on the first set I got did not fit any of my Canon DSLRs. I was sent a replacement pair and they too did not screw into my camera. I am return them all. 
5306 4 It was gift 
5307 0 terrible 
5308 4 Got exactly what I ordered quickly and everything is just as I expected it. Couldn t ask for more. 
5309 0 Camera won t connect to phone. App won t let me sign in on tablet. They shipped a color they didn t even have as an option. Instructions had details wrong. No troubleshooting in instructions. Did I forget anything? Now I have to get my money back. 
5310 4 Purchased these as a gift for my dad. He says that they re nice and lightweight, with a bit more strength than his previous binoculars. 
5311 4 Good price and fast shipping 
5312 4 Got away from kit lenses and glad I did, I have alot more keepers now 
5313 4 Lights the model very well. The honeycomb grid directs the light very evenly. 
5314 4 Looked great for my Holiday photos! Good quality too. Wish it was larger size. 
5315 3 Protects the lensce and gives it a cool look👌 
5316 4 For the Price there is nothing better 
5317 1 Impossible to set up. Our son could not figure it out and he is a network engineer! 
5318 0 Did not fit phone correct as advertised. 
5319 4 Works as expected. I have no trouble with the fit of the plug/socket on the D610 that some report. A must have for long exposure shots. Landscape type shots with these high res cameras also benefit using a cable/remote shutter release 
5320 0 Doesn t work 
5321 4 Affordable lens for great bokeh! 
5322 4 It is exactly as described. I would deal with this supplier again 
5323 4 i love it 
5324 4 Was nicer than I expected. Also the bag itself is relatively easy to carry. 
5325 4 Good quality OEM product! 
5326 4 Awesome 
5327 2 decent system for a decent price. 
5328 4 Awsome and it was quick shipment 
5329 4 Was everything I expected. 
5330 4 It is good shape and works fine. 
5331 4 Simple to use, and made me feel much better about protecting the LCD on my camera. 
5332 4 Everything was just as expected. Thanks. 
5333 4 great product. 
5334 4 Great item. Delivered promptly and product was perfect. 
5335 4 Fits perfectly and inexpensive 
5336 2 Charger works well. Batteries have a very short life (50%) compared to original. 
5337 2 The price is right. Doesn t work with my Odin TTL flash trigger, but it works as advertised when it is on camera. That s what happens when you try to save money. 
5338 4 I bought a digital camera at the pawn shop for ten bucks not knowing if it was even going to work and as soon as the battery came I popped it in and it worked! 
5339 4 i think it has longer battery life than the original. 
5340 0 The package that i got didnt work 
5341 4 Love it! 
5342 4 As described and arrived on time. 
5343 4 just right 
5344 4 They work just as well as the OEM batteries for half the price. 
5345 4 Great for backup. 
5346 4 Love it 
5347 4 Did what it was supposed to. Battery charged, no issues. 
5348 4 wonderful and strong and reliable 
5349 4 Very nice kit, great price!! 
5350 4 fit well and stays on 
5351 2 Item works as expected, arrived ahead of time. I bit small for what i had in mind but it woks. 
5352 3 excelent product 
5353 3 Great little camera. Nice pics. Videos take a while to download via WiFi. Going to get a second one for my quad. 
5354 1 Clamp may work well enough. But I didn t get that far. The arms inside the Gopro mount adapter are too thick. When I mount the camera, the screw does not reach the nut on the opposite side. Useless to mount a Gopro. Back it goes. 
5355 4 This camera, thus far is superior to the DLink product which costs more. They could use a bit of work on the directions but once I got what they were asking it was a snap. 
5356 1 What do you expect for 25.00 dollars. 
5357 2 I m indifferent about this. I thought it would have a little more blowing force but it does its job. 
5358 3 I love the flexibility of options this shutter gives. Would highly recommend. Only complaint is, like almost everybody else has mentioned, is that is has no on/off switch and will activate easily in a bag if the batteries are left in it. 
5359 4 simple, easy, fun, and great for scrapbooking, or as party favors! 
5360 4 having the extra power on hand is crucial when you re out and about. Threw these into my backpack and went all over Mexico with plenty of space on my memory card and plenty of juice in the form of batteries. 
5361 0 quality...You must be kidding 
5362 4 I use this as my carry on for business travel. This thing is a TANK. 
5363 4 works great everything i expected 
5364 4 Impressive 
5365 4 Leaps and bounds better than my 50 D. I still use both cameras but the 70 D is my first choice. Light years better than my old 30D. mike 
5366 4 Excellent product. We use it at the range. 
5367 4 This item looks great and seems to be made very well. Works perfect and very easy to use. Everything was as described and works great. It fits very well to my GoPro camera. Great value for the money. I highly recommend this to everyone. 
5368 0 Need to return this. It never worked. Worst product I ve ever ordered off of Amazon. It turned on but would not record anything. Then was unable to turn it off. Seriously do not buy this. 
5369 4 Pelican is just the best...I have bought other cases, but these are the best available and worth the often small premium. I use mine for go pro and SLR gear and have no fear of water, dropping, or other calamities. 
5370 3 It works as I expected, sometimes the camera don t record when someone pass in front of the door. 
5371 4 Love how spacious is! Everything is well cushioned, which protects the equipment. 
5372 4 Works fine ! 
5373 0 I thought it would be perfect and ordered one. The product did not work and even when changing the batteries, it still did not work. I ll try another product and see if I have better luck. 
5374 2 Definitely not as expected, much smaller than I anticipated. I will re-order a larger one & send this back. 
5375 3 Nice value for money. More than enough light for all my use cases. 
5376 4 Started with the Foscam... Returned that for this vastly superior product. 
5377 3 I got exactly what I expected. Case Logic always makes good camera bags. 
5378 4 WOW! I love this I have made use of it for picture taking it is durable but lightweight it is very comfortable and stays in place when walking the price is great didn t know what to expect because of the price but I am very happy. 
5379 4 Exactly what I needed. And got it quick 
5380 1 Didn t give me the results I was looking for. However, that may be my lack of understanding of infrared filters. 
5381 4 Amazing 
5382 4 This is so adorable! I bought this to go with the Fugufilm Instax Mini 8 Instant Camera. I think this is a must have to go with the camera! Love everything in the box! 
5383 3 Took it to 10m under water and works fine. Although the battery seems having a shorter life under water, but generally fine. The image quality is just so so with the original lens. No experince on other lens. 
5384 4 Fits perfectly, works, one third the price of the way-overpriced Canon version. What more is there to say? Those who say it doesn t fit must be putting it on the wrong lens, this is for the 18-55 STM version. 
5385 0 I ordered 2 and got 1 not pleased 
5386 4 worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks. 
5387 2 The cd would not load and the instructions were not in English. I figured out mostly how to use the camera but I have not tried to print out any pictures yet. 
5388 4 The video quality is great and it switches to night vision gracefully. Sound quality is not so great. Even with speakers hooked up to either laptop/computer, its very hard to hear noise. The reason this is so important to me is because I use it as a baby monitor. 
5389 4 Perfect 
5390 4 This is perfect for my Lumix GX7 camera and it fits it perfectly. 
5391 4 Get s the job done 
5392 4 Fantastic lens! Clarity and quality of shots is amazing 
5393 4 It s so useful for product photography and portrait also macro photography , so I order it from you , thank you for arriving it so quickly 
5394 4 Great camera 
5395 4 Works great for my needs 
5396 4 Works automatically with my cycling computer. Just wet the sensors and strap it on. Strap is comfortable. Nothing much more to it! 
5397 4 I would buy this again, as well as recomend it to friends.good price 
5398 4 great bag 
5399 4 Works as well as any other filter set and price is reasonable. 
5400 0 did not fit my lens 
5401 0 Item broke within a week. Money wasted on something that didn t work. 
5402 3 Good camera 
5403 3 Everything was good except for one of the light blubs not working. Overall the home studio is coming along quite well with the addition these units. 
5404 4 Perfect for me photo needs 
5405 4 This slider is the perfect length! Not so long for transporting. Not that heavy either but the build quality is great! Very smooth operation. Bought the Manfrotto MVH500h Fluid head with it, works great! 
5406 2 It s definitely not super great in quality, but does the job in terms of capturing a wider angle as a macro lens. Definitely had fun using it, but would not use for professional grade photos! 
5407 4 Excellent product 
5408 2 Email motion alerts are crapped ! 
5409 4 Best mount for the Mobius action cam. 
5410 4 This is a cheap version of a tulip lens hood, but it did the trick as well as the overpriced ones. I d purchase it again in a heartbeat. 
5411 2 Would have liked the cases to be a bit more sturdy but worked as expected. 
5412 3 Good price, quick shipping 
5413 4 Great, as expected 
5414 4 Used this with a gopro on a recent dive trip. Six dives in total and it worked well every time. It made for some great underwater shots and selfies with the rest of the dive crew. Solid construction, lightweight and easy to adjust. 
5415 4 Practical bag for my Sony NX-5N and lenses 
5416 4 excellent graduated ND filter 
5417 3 Great value 
5418 2 its works pretty well 
5419 4 must have great backdrop indeed 
5420 4 Really enjoying the mount thus far. Very sturdy and secure. 
5421 4 Yeah these are awesome. There is a trick to fold them, but there are good videos online. Seller could include a link to a good video though! 
5422 0 Worst product I ve ever received on amazon. It doesn t work, it doesn t have any of the features that it states. Can t believe they can even sell crap like that! What a joke is right!! 
5423 1 Disconnects during transfers to my smart phone, got no response from Nikon as to the software they provide. Cannot maintain a connection to my Nikon D3200. Waste of money... 
5424 4 Great camera. Super happy with it. 
5425 4 Love this camera. The instant gratification of your pictures being printed instantly is fantastic 
5426 4 Fits my new Lumix perfectly. 
5427 4 I think that s what the Doctor order. 
5428 4 ok 
5429 4 Nice. 
5430 4 A must have for photographers. You can fix horizon lines in photoshop, but why have to with this. 
5431 0 The telephoto extender did not fit any of my EF Canon lenses. 
5432 4 William Tom was wonderful helping me in getting the camera up and running. Got on my computer and in 2 minutes I was up and running, great tech support! This Camera is fantastic so far.. 
5433 3 Decent filter, only thing they only have the 52mm size but no markings to identify the manometers. Would not have been that much more effort to add 690nm, 1000nm, ect... on filter. My other filter was also like that so 4 stars. 
5434 4 Awesome device! 
5435 4 As advertised. 
5436 4 Item works well 
5437 4 The camera works just fine. Gives acceptable video. 
5438 4 It even fools me. I catch myself going into the room to turn off the TV before I leave, only to realize it s just the fake TV doing it s thing. 
5439 2 No Complains on the Hood, but unfortunately, I have vignetting issues on my 10-18mm lens so if you are looking for wide angle not recommended, else its good. 
5440 4 A great camera kit for an even better price! Easy to use a pretty straight forward DSLR 
5441 4 Excellent product at a great price. 
5442 4 Takes great photos. However, the camera is either too small for my hands and fingers or my hands and fingers are too big for this camera. Since Amazon won t give me a bigger camera I asked God to give me smaller hands and fingers. 
5443 4 Very nice item!!!!!! I got it earlier than I expected, great shipping !!!!!!! 
5444 4 Excellent product! 
5445 4 love the new camera strap! I get lots of complements on the new look! Love the colors and the sizing. 
5446 4 After trying 4 other cameras. This one is great. Opened the package and 5 minutes later we were viewing picture on APP. 
5447 4 Work great, nice packing. 
5448 4 Very nice 
5449 2 It s a good bag other that it really needs a little more support in the back to keep your items from beating you up when you have it on. 
5450 1 For the price, the build quality could be much better. Specially the pol filter is tricky to screw on and easily can fall off. Was expecting much better quality for such a price tag. 
5451 4 Love it! 
5452 4 Great protective case while still allowing you to touch the screen through the case. It s a must have for the GoPro! 
5453 4 works great. arrived as promised. very good value. 
5454 3 works fine 
5455 4 I think this one is the best you can get for the money 
5456 1 The green part is dark. Not a true choroma green color.. Requires more light to render green screen properly... I regret buying it. 
5457 4 Real nice 
5458 4 Easy to use. Once you find out the best area you need to place the monitor its very easy and I have had no problems with using this device. I would purchase this product again. 
5459 4 I used this lense to rake time lapse of a sunset. The pictures are so clear abe crisp. 
5460 4 Excellent product at low Price and excellent comunication with the seller, the i­tem arrived before the date estimated, thanks a lot!!! full recommended. 
5461 4 Excellent déclencheur mutifonction je le recommande 
5462 4 Awesome product. I like it much better than the screw on and safety clip version. 
5463 4 I m not a professional photographer so I don t see the stuff they see in photos. All I know is this filter works for me & my nx2000 with no &#34;X&#34; in the picture like people claim to have. 
5464 4 Incredibly well made, fits perfect. Firmly holds both the camera and lens. 
5465 4 nice 
5466 4 Helps my device stay a float in water. Color is visible from far away. 
5467 4 Love it 
5468 4 it does what it says it was going to do 
5469 4 Works great!!! 
5470 3 Great deal and an excellent product 
5471 4 Worked great on my recent vacation. It is a bit heavy to carry on the camera around my neck but I just supported it in one hand while walking and it was fine. Wish I would have bought this one years ago! 
5472 4 very good quality 
5473 4 Worked great! I used it with my iPhone and Camera, pictures came out great! Bluetooth worked great on this as well. 
5474 3 Good. 
5475 3 The more I use it the more I like it. For the price it s great, but the software could use some refining. 
5476 4 very sweet grip 
5477 4 very good 
5478 3 Bought as a replacement for an older set wanted better glass than I had. These are very clear and lightweight. I will be taking them on my next hunting trip. 
5479 4 Works great 
5480 4 This case for moving your Slik tripod around is very well engineered and made. I am glad I purchased it with the tripod. 
5481 4 Terrific camera. Very compact very easy to carry 
5482 4 Fast and perfect fit! Highly recommend this company. I was worried about a lens cap which wasn t Canon made but Canon s were so expensive...these fit well and have attaching chords....Delivery time was before I could lose my last lens cap! Thanks! 
5483 4 These work perfectly, small and cheap enough for one in every camera bag. Batteries are easy yo find and last a very long time. 
5484 0 defective would not work at all 
5485 2 European 
5486 4 Love this little thing, but make sure the gopro is showing or else it might look like somthing a bit weird. Works Perfectly and is fun to use! 
5487 4 I ve used this product over the last year while skiing in Colorado, underwater in Mexico and everywhere in between. Works like a charm, never had a problem with use or durability. 
5488 4 Great strap!! Got this for my dad as a gift and it works amazingly! 
5489 4 Quick delivery, item just as described. 
5490 4 Not sure of the battery s charge life yet, but so far the battery works great in my camera. 
5491 1 Too heavy for a phone, and the quality of the picture comes out too distorted on the edges. The quality of the alleged &#34;Professional HD&#34; camera lens needs serious improvement. I love wide lens, but this one is a big disappointment. 
5492 4 Love it. The ball joint is my favorite feature. Love the construction, feels well built but super light-weight. Quickmount is a bit tough to get on and off. 
5493 4 Good 
5494 4 Working like a champ! 
5495 4 Works Like the Nikon Battery. Camera Shows the Information about the state of the battery. So Far NO Problems. 
5496 4 These are great lens cleaning cloths. I bought extra so that I could keep some in each backpack and my travel case. They also make great presents for all your friends that shoot Canon 
5497 0 This camera is junk, I could never get it too work. If you re looking I would definitely pass on this one. 
5498 4 Good thanks 
5499 0 Doesn t work with Sigma DP1s 
5500 0 did not work as expected. returned 
5501 4 The system works great. The DVR was easy to hook up and installion of the cameras was a breeze. 
5502 4 Great Product for the Price. I ordered a backup since the price was reasonable. 
5503 3 Great case for what I needed 
5504 3 Good product. Nice to take it. Confortable. 
5505 4 Great little camera for snorkeling. Has a nice secure lock on the battery cover and takes great underwater photos at shallow depths. 
5506 4 Works just as well or better than the original Canon battery. Using in Canon G3 X camera. 
5507 4 Brilliant. Just with turning on the two modules are connected within seconds. It works perfectly and the scope (complies with what the manufacturer says) is more than enough for the task for which I need it. Always carry spare batteries just in case. 
5508 0 photo instructions are NO value. There is no visible way to connect the wires to the power terminals. 
5509 4 It arrive quickly and was exactly as described in listing. 
5510 4 it s alright 
5511 3 Working just fine with my GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition. 
5512 4 Loved it. Exactly what I needed. Thanks 
5513 4 Brilliant quality, used underwater and it floated perfectly, even with the weight of the GoPro. Loved the design, would definitely recommend. 
5514 2 wish the remote came with a cord. The tripod is a lil flimsy but it s a quick fix 
5515 4 as expected, but it has 9 leg clamps to go full extension. 
5516 4 Great product, easy to install 
5517 4 These portfolios are ideal for things you care about. I ve been pleased with everyone that I have purchased. They will hold a lot of material in a minimum of space. 
5518 4 Excelente 
5519 2 It s okay. Lots of good information, but I still find myself googling and youtubing things to find out more simplified versions of this information. I ll keep it, but it s still a bit above my beginner s level. 
5520 0 It only lasted a few months and it no longer holds a charge. The original battery that came with my camera is still going strong after three years. Over $36.00 and I had to throw it away. 
5521 1 The lens stopped working in a year. 
5522 3 the reason this is not a 5 Star is that the clip does not rotate.. so it s only adjustable in one direction. For the price I paid, I really expected more flexibility. otherwise, it s a great product and seems to be something that will stand up to use. 
5523 4 Great Charger, very compact and for a great price! 
5524 4 Good quality photos! 
5525 4 Great deal for this!, shipping fast and product works awesome now I have 3 batteries all the time ready to go in my Go Pro. 
5526 4 Love it works really good 
5527 4 Try this. Wrap the clip with masking tape or some soft tape. Mount the GoPro camera on and bite the mount. Film from mouth level and use the remote to take pics. Helpful? 
5528 4 Great service, I got exactly what I asked for. 
5529 2 Good quality 
5530 3 camera is awesome great point and shoot! 
5531 4 Great price for this timer. I used with my Canon 7D to create a time lapse video of a remodeling project in my home. It s easy to use, has an on-off switch, and uses standard batteries. I highly recommend it and would buy it again. 
5532 0 Not what I was expected, to cheap. 
5533 4 The best! 
5534 4 I have 2 of these units they are great for the money im also thinking of getting another one for my winter home in florida. 
5535 4 Very pleased with product and service 
5536 1 The product itself is good but I do not receive the rubber pad neither the top rubber cover 
5537 4 Works (and looks) just like the Nikon original HB-69 lens hood for a fraction of the price. People that have issues mounting the hood (too loose....?!?!?) need to turn it just a tad further until it clicks securely into place. No complaints at this price!!! 
5538 4 Arrived quickly works fine 
5539 3 I used this a lot 
5540 4 My purchase was for a replacement, lost the charger. This charger and the batteries are excellent. The service time was short, I am happy. Thank you 
5541 2 Haven t used it yet bought it to replace one I broke that belonged to someone else. The one I broke has problem fitting in the holder and s tr staying steady. 
5542 1 Gives connection error after a few clicks.. 
5543 4 Great product. Prompt delivery. 
5544 4 Awesome investment ! Great quality for a low price ! 
5545 0 It filled up with water and sunk the first time I used it. 
5546 4 Work great so far. I love not having to worry about the lens cap. 
5547 4 The unique filter. Excellent effect. The criteria are different, but I liked it very much. I suppose that it gives a different effect on different lenses. 
5548 4 great 
5549 0 [[VIDEOID:32726b0daee64c9d77072690c0baf647]]Unfortunately just a few days outside the one month return window the camera broke. The record button no longer works. Since I cannot return it I took it apart and the button is stuck in its housing so it is not fixable. 
5550 0 THIS THING DOESNT COME WITH THE REQUIRED 12V POWER ADAPTER!!!!!! I don t know how well it works yet. Gotta buy a power source...... lame 
5551 4 Excellent 
5552 4 Works great with my Hero Three! Holds a charge longer than the original battery and charge time is pretty quick. Great deal for the price! 
5553 4 Good quality. Seems solid. I like the ability to unsnap and resnap it from the camera quickly rather than having to fully remove the tether. It floats a Olympus Tough TG-4. 
5554 0 Unhappy with stiffness 
5555 3 Everything arrived on time and in great condition. The bag straps, however, are starting to fall apart, so will have to buy a new bag very soon. I strongly recommend persons buying this to have a backup bag as well. 
5556 4 good quality 
5557 4 as advertised... delivered on time... no disappointing surprises... will consider the company s products first if they offer what I need... THANKS, J 
5558 3 Size was perfect for my Sony Alpha a5000. It is thicker than expected compared to ones I have purchased for other devices. Instructions are a little lacking which could prove to be a problem for anyone lacking experience installing this types of screen protectors. 
5559 4 This worked perfectly for my camera and I got it really fast!! I was hesitant to buy this one because it was so much cheaper than the others, but I got it anyway and it works perfectly!! Very happy with my purchase! 
5560 4 Thanks. Bluetooth doesnt work but i loved everything else 
5561 4 Good product, nice quality. Compatible with Logitech C920 
5562 3 Not having an ON/OFF switch and having to take out the batteries is only negative feedback I can provide. Everything else is as advertised. Extremely happy with purchase. 
5563 4 Works great 
5564 3 good quality 
5565 4 Batteries hold charge and i can use the battery charger in my car..love it 
5566 4 Love my camera back pack and how it can hold soo much. I now have a larger laptop but still pack this bag for long trips so I will still have it. 
5567 1 Great price but the rubber eyecup pulled loose from the plastic frame and had to be glued before I attached it to my camera. 
5568 0 We have been using these for only a few months now and already one of the two we bought is dead, will not hold a charge. UGH! 
5569 1 This was a great purchase - but 8 months later, it s completely stopped working. 
5570 3 Great package and price, fast service and works very well. 
5571 4 I ve been using Lithium batteries in place of alkaline for many devices--especially those that I tend to overlook for long periods of time. Time may prove different, but I ve yet to have a leakage problem with these. 
5572 4 Do what they need to do, great little piece of equipment. 
5573 3 Just received these so have not had enough time to compare with other, similar, cloths. However, the quality appears to be excellent and they are more than large enough to handle almost any cleaning requirement. 
5574 4 Works just like it is supposed to. Does not come with detailed instructions for recording/motion detector settings but works well. 
5575 4 Good all around! 
5576 3 Great price for what u get! 
5577 4 A lot of quality equipment for the price! 
5578 3 Works as advertised. No problems nor issues. 
5579 4 loved therm 
5580 4 Works Great!! 
5581 4 Everything was as promised. Thanks! 
5582 0 It did not work, I had to return it and get my money back. 
5583 4 Thanks! My cam is working again! 
5584 3 Works well. 
5585 0 Didn t fit at all on my Camileo X100 video camera. Difficult to find the right cap for that. Universal means it should fit, right? 
5586 0 Some of the parts are useful , most I found won t fit the camera,poor engineering I believe, stick with the go pro accessories! The case as far as I can see was not made to hold the camera securely and not well thought out. 
5587 0 These frames are cheap plastic and they do NOT work! I ve been trying to get the company to take them back and give me a refund, to no avail! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT! COMPLETE RIP OFF! And lousy customer service. 
5588 4 Everything I expected... 
5589 4 Just what I needed and at a great value. 
5590 2 The Macro lens is pretty amazing. The fish eye isn t as good. 
5591 4 Works great with my S3000, recharges and downloads. 
5592 4 This lens is absolutely amazing. I use it primary for family photos, cooking images and video interviews. It brings out vibrant colors, textures and depth of field that I ve never been able to achieve before. It s worth every penny! 
5593 0 There was no audio coming from the camera. 
5594 4 My first security cameras, easy to install and simple to use. Only wish I could zoom in and out. 
5595 4 Yes. It was just what I was looking for to replace my very old one which was broken. In fact, the new Spinning Photo Cube is far better than the old one I had to replace. Thank you, Amazon! 
5596 4 great 
5597 4 Loved everything in this pack, all fun goodies to go with my camera. It came on time and in excellent condition! 
5598 4 My daughter loved the film itself. She s a pretty big Disney fan. The pictures are so cutE 
5599 4 more than pleased ... great. exactly as advertized ... super easy setup 
5600 4 Just as described--and just what I needed--with perfect shipping! Thanks so much! 
5601 3 JUST WHAT I WANTED 
5602 3 No comments 
5603 4 Excellent 
5604 4 Worked great! 
5605 0 Cannot recommend. Shoe would not even fit in my Nikon. 
5606 0 Did not charge my camera :( 
5607 4 Very practical to have on hand. 
5608 4 Fits perfectly and matches the textured finish on the lens. Don t be alarmed by the tiny gap as any light entering from the side is not going to affect your image. 
5609 4 This seems to work just fine, as well as the factory brand, for a lot less money. Recommended. 
5610 4 Great camera! Love that it is light weight and takes great pictures! Received on time and in great condition! 
5611 3 East setup and installation, Excellent color and clarity. 
5612 4 received in time pleased 
5613 4 Very fast shipping! Exactly what I needed 
5614 3 took a while to get here, but thats ok 
5615 4 I use this camera whenever I shoot landscapes and it has never failed me. It s quite durable and the images it produces are razor sharp. 
5616 3 Very pleased with the camera so far. 
5617 4 It is sturdy and built well. Relatively light weight. I have no complaints really. 
5618 4 Good 
5619 3 Seems to work fine although it is a bit bulky for what it actually does.... 
5620 4 priced great, car plugin is great. 
5621 4 Just what I needed. Promptly shipped. Good price. 
5622 0 Less than 80 degree tilt what in the world would you use this for? Staring at the ground? 
5623 4 Thank you for the case the product looks and feel amazing Thumps up for you 
5624 4 excellent, very nice company to deal with. 
5625 4 I like the FloatPro! It s easier to put on and more comfortable than the chest strap I have. I also positions the camera higher and that helps avoid frequent views of my paddleboard paddle. 
5626 4 HI I BUY OTHER LENS THEN I TAKE PICTURE THE PICTURE IS STILL BLUR THE CAMERA NOT FOCUS GOOD WHAT CAN I DO NOW THE CAMERA STILL GUARANTY CAN I RETURN THE CAMERA 
5627 4 This camera is loaded with more features than I have mastered yet. It takes excellent pictures, even in low light. I bought a factory reconditioned one so i added a 2 warranty as a precaution. 
5628 3 Was okay for the price, you can get more shots of film for less if you really do your research. 
5629 4 Great product with super fast shipping. 
5630 2 I got this case for my Raspberry Red camera and the colors don t match. The case is darker than the camera. I think this is a great protective case, the only problem is that the camera is hard to take out sometimes but overall this is great 
5631 2 Cheap, but you get what you pay 
5632 4 Nice quality bag, stylish and perfect way to store and carry your camera while on the go. 
5633 4 Great deal! Thank you! Love the kit. 
5634 2 My camera did not fit on the tripod and it was a Instax camera! 
5635 4 Fits great! Would buy from this seller again :) 
5636 1 The case is fine but it did not protect my camera lens when the bag got dropped. Now that I had to purchase a new lens, I am also purchasing a more protective case. 
5637 4 These are awesome mounts, I have one on my bike helmet and one on my kayak helmet. Look out YouTube the next sports sensation is on his way. HA! 
5638 0 Very disappointing Lever broke almost instantly making it unusable. Flimsy construction. Total waste of money. 
5639 4 Nice backup for my original battery. A charge lasts well. 
5640 4 Exactly what I wanted, without the added cost. Fits my Canon lens perfectly. 
5641 4 It is really easy to control and the battery life is impressive. 
5642 4 Great value. 
5643 2 It will fit the a7rii, but you will have to fit it upside down. The borders are thinner on the left side. Right side-up and it will cover a very small part of the screen. Otherwise, the size of the entire screen protector is the correct dimensions. 
5644 4 Using it in Costa Rica right now! Great purchase to protect my investment. 
5645 2 Good cap wrong size. 
5646 4 works perfectly 
5647 0 awful. don t buy it. 
5648 4 Great mini quad. You will not be disappointed for the price. Have fun and fly safe. 
5649 3 The product is great and very versatile, but the zippers are low quality. The stitching at the ends does not prevent you from pulling the zipper all the way off of the end. (this happened to me on one side) 
5650 4 This case is amazing. I bring my drone on the plane when I travel about once a month. This is a solid case that fits all of my accessories and looks great. The handle and wheels are great and it is easy to move while traveling. 
5651 4 I love it It is great 😁👍👌 
5652 4 I had a soft box just sitting around because it wouldn t fit any of my lights. This universal ring allowed me to finally put it to use , and surprising works even better than the standard rings with other lights. 
5653 4 Much better than the original one i had, it s super bright, superb CRI, wonderful size, just wish there was a soft box included or as an option 
5654 4 Great Camera and with everything that comes with the bundle a great bang for ya buck....Camera takes great pic s even for an amateur like me 
5655 3 It provides the best exposure. I don t have to perform any white balance correction on my images. 
5656 4 Shipped on time. Works ok 
5657 4 Great camera 
5658 3 Very smooth fluid head. only issue is when you are panning left or right the base seems to click or pop like it isn t lubricated well enough. That s the reason for the four stars. 
5659 3 Did seem to be able to hold a charge as long as OEM GoPro batteries. Typically would get 45-50 minutes out of goPro battery compared to 30-40 minutes with these on my Hero 3 Blk 
5660 4 protects my camera holds accessories 
5661 1 after two months my video on my smart phone is connecting to someone else s camera I don t know where in the world! App crashes every single time 
5662 3 I shoot at times with five flashes. A lot to keep track of but it will do several more. Works every time except when I made a mistake. OOPS 
5663 4 This GoPro is as barebones as you can get, you will eventually need to upgrade though as I did since you can t record quality audio with this. It is just a regular point and shoot GoPro 
5664 4 better than what i thought. 
5665 3 Nice nocs. Nothing spectacular but they are great for the price. I have had no complaints with these. 
5666 4 excellent 
5667 4 Versatile, you can use the shoulder strap or place it on your hip. 
5668 4 Excellent product. I would order again thank you 
5669 4 [[VIDEOID:6b380c4d9dc4ade4c4475b347444e5c8]]This is an amazing camera. Small looks expensive and works great the best I have found in amazon. SJ4000 Sports Cam Best GoPro Alternative! Here is my driving test https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMd1XBk9zpo 
5670 4 Bought it for my husband. He loves this camera. Very easy for people who are not technology smart to learn. 
5671 4 Using this for cave photography/video very pleased with the results. 
5672 4 As advertised 
5673 4 every thing that I hoped it would be and more 
5674 4 Works well. No issues so far. 
5675 3 Than I imagined to be small, but the price is very good! 
5676 2 Worked once for me, doesn t stick on the dashboard, it dropped my camera not too happy about that but it s very disappointing cause I really wanted one guess I will have to just do without. 
5677 3 Great Product 
5678 2 The build quality is good, but I found that I had to really torque the knobs to hold the camera. That said, it met my needs for a stable mount for my camera. 
5679 2 The bag didn t even come close to holding the camera. Very disappointed. 
5680 4 It was perfect. I use it as a screen for my phone camera with my drone. 
5681 4 amazing heavy stand, holds my Kupo baby boom rock solid 
5682 4 This camera is amazing!! It s so adorable, perfect for the hello kitty lover in your family. Take some getting used to with the different settings but easy to follow. I would highly recommend. 
5683 0 very heavy and cant take off the head 
5684 4 Great price 
5685 4 Works as advertised. Perfect fit to my scope. 
5686 1 The time stamp wouldn t deactivate when I chose &#34;no date.&#34; Everything else was great, but I don t want a time/date stamp on all my videos, so I sent it back. 
5687 0 It was good while it lasted but it stopped working 2 months and so, now it was a complete waste of money. 
5688 4 Super cute shinny film. Perfect for a young girl or for a birthday party. Fast delivery 
5689 4 great product 
5690 4 Runs great. Install was relatively easy. Nice green light. 
5691 4 seemed like it was going to be a little bigger than I expected but still cute and pictures come out very clear loved it 
5692 3 The quality of the camera isn t the best but it s fun to use and it works great! 
5693 3 Works perfectly. Modified it to add an autoguiding port using shoestringastronomy.com s GPUSB and instructions! Allowed me to turn my Celestron CG-4 mount into an autoguiding mount for astrophotography. 
5694 4 This is a great camera! 
5695 4 Excellent product and service 
5696 4 Reasonably priced, items as described, arrived when promised. Seller recommended. 
5697 4 Product delivered as described and pictures. It was a nice surprise to see felt cases provided with each lense. 
5698 3 Good 
5699 3 The product does a great job but very difficult to setup. I would suggest the plug and play do you don t have to play with the router setting. Does not work with the app as I have to go through IP 
5700 4 very good material 
5701 4 Much easier to set up wirelessly than previous camera I had. MyDlink gives great connection to device. 
5702 4 Great value. I use my GoPros on my motorcycles and the lenses get chipped easily. I needed to replace the lenses and these were great fit perfect. 
5703 4 its so great to have extra batteries for the Go Pro, especially when you don t have the time or place to charge! 
5704 4 Smooth transaction. Fast shipping. A+++. Thanks you!!! 
5705 2 good 
5706 4 Study design and bundle to have. I don t have to worry anymore about adapters. 
5707 4 Best thing I ve bought in a while! I love thus camera! 
5708 3 great just need to be build a little better 
5709 4 Perfect! Works with camera and charger as well as the original battery. 
5710 4 It s pricey, but it works well. I got it so I wouldn t have to worry about losing the lens cap. 
5711 4 Good value 
5712 1 Great shipping product wasn t that great. 
5713 4 Perfect! I would like to purchase from Goja again if I need other related products. 
5714 4 This case is a great size and holds a few extras like batteries and cables. 
5715 4 What s really to say about micro fiber cloths? Excellent quality, cheap and useful! 
5716 4 Great battery. I was the second photographer for a wedding with a 5d mark ii. I took close 1,000 shots and this wasn t even half dead yet. I m glad I found these batteries and was able to pick up plenty of backups for a great price. Highly Recommend. 
5717 4 GREAT! Great price, service & product 
5718 4 Very nice and useful product! Used along with Mogopod, they are a great pair, and make great videos. 
5719 4 charger works well 
5720 4 What a wonderful product. The cloth is beautiful, and so soft. The picture is beautiful and perfect. 
5721 3 Great Product 
5722 0 Would not work with my camera/lens. 
5723 4 Surprisingly works better than expected. It works as expected. Was a little tight when initially closing while latched to the camera but I like that. In my head it seems as if it s just a tighter latch 
5724 3 I love everything about this bag except the fabric. There is more than enough room for my camera and necessary purse items. I love the pocket for a water bottle. The removable camera bag is excellent. I would just like a different fabric. 
5725 4 Best aftermarket batteries I have found as replacements for the Sony NP-FM500H 
5726 4 Love the hero 4 Was delivered quickly and received all the items in one shipment which was very nice. 
5727 4 Awesome 
5728 1 Pretty much disappointed in bebop drone 1000 down the drain. 
5729 2 While not a disaster, it s nothing sensational. Basically, the 3 stars is the middle of the ratings and this set is pretty much middle of the pack for digital backgrounds. Draped Muslin is probably the worst collection in the batch. 
5730 4 works great 
5731 3 The lamp and light is great... just be careful when installing the batteries. As you remove the battery cover and replace it, it is VERY EASY to break two of the prongs that hold the cover onto the base of the light. 
5732 4 Worked great out of the box. Although I must admit the software works much better with Windows than with Apple. 
5733 0 Unusable. Plastic flexes rather than grips. 
5734 4 It s a good option for indoor moments 
5735 4 Amazing bundle. This is the best bundle I have seen on Amazon and I look forward to purchasing another one for sure. :) 
5736 4 Great Bag.!! for my canon 6D with 24-106 lens and laptop 
5737 4 This case is everything I needed and wanted. 
5738 4 Is a very good camera, considering the good price. Is as well as a gopro but cheaper 
5739 4 Great deal! Very durable! I m really enjoying this convenient way of carrying my lenses and camera! 
5740 3 Sharp lens. Would like to have a few more markings on the lens and controls. 
5741 0 Duds...batteries don t fully charge 
5742 4 Excellent transaction and you could not tell that camera had been reconditioned. Love the red color and easy to spot the camera. Works fine and happy to have it. Would buy more items from this vendor. 
5743 4 excelent , no problem 
5744 4 Does the job. Just remember to select the correct range. 
5745 4 Excellent Product. Charges Fast. Reliable. 
5746 4 Excellent mini-tripod base for using while Periscoping. Very good balance for my iPhone 6. 
5747 1 The I have had this camera for exactly 47 days and the lens is already making a weird &#34;zipper noise&#34; whenever the lens extends. Not only is this affecting my audio, but I fear the problem is only going to get worse.. 
5748 3 Excellent information and presented in a useful way. Thanks 
5749 3 Fun camera. Very easy to use. The ability to change the focus point after the photo was been snapped is awesome. The lens cap is easy to lose though. 
5750 4 great case fits all my accessories with gopro 
5751 4 Just what i was looking for! At The right price! 
5752 2 It was a gift to my boyfriend!! 
5753 4 Good product! Great price. 
5754 4 I use both of these with my Canon water/shock proof camera. One will keep it afloat, but I like the extra security of having 2. Attached both to the mounting loop and I can just let the camera float in the water safely. They do not soak up water. 
5755 4 It was amazing to wear it in a 31km trail race in Switzerland with the Chest mount harness and didn t even notice it. Even took it sideways during some of the cliffs to shoot them while running. 4 1/2 hours and not one issue even during the rain............Love it! 
5756 4 certainly love this lens! 
5757 3 I like them 
5758 4 So happy that everything I ve tried in my purchase so far has worked and is of good quality. Great deal! 
5759 0 This does not work at all with the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 I bought at the same time. I want to return it. 
5760 3 Purchased for shooting H.S. Volleyball action. Just what I was looking for. 
5761 1 Too small to be functional/useful. Camera fits, but nothing else. 
5762 3 Scratches kind of easily so it does get hard to see the actual screen. However that said, it is clearly doing its job by protecting the main screen. 
5763 3 I like it, it is what it says it is. However, it s a little fragile, so handle with care. 
5764 0 I could not see any improvement from normal phone lens. 
5765 3 It works great and looks great. The screws are very low quality, i would use your own screws if attaching to wood. 
5766 4 great deal. exactly as expected! 
5767 4 Great attachment to have 
5768 4 I love it and recommend this product to everyone. Thank you. 
5769 3 Very well, including underwater, except that there is no lens cover 
5770 4 Maximum allowable size, heavy duty rolling suitcase for your gear. It was super helpful on my last overseas trip. I was confident it would fit carry on baggage limits, confident it would protect my gear, and it was really convenient rolling out the plane and in the terminal etcetera. 
5771 4 Awesome product!! 
5772 4 Super easy to set up. Great picture. THE FUTURE IS NOW! 
5773 0 Not beginner friendly at all. I ve been trying to balance it for almost 4 hours now, didn t work at all. Still trying, looked at the CD, every tutorial on youtube. I find it impossible 
5774 4 great camera, no issues 
5775 0 Came off and left a permanent residue on my screen. 
5776 3 Love that it connects to my DLNA media sever but keeps loosing connection with it. Trying to figure out how to keep it more consistent. Picture quality is fantastic and love the functionality. 
5777 0 Couldn t get it to work properly. Would up in the trash with my old one. 
5778 4 Works as advertised. 
5779 4 Excelente 
5780 4 works great cant beat the price 
5781 4 thank you 
5782 1 I am glad that it came with two. After a couple hours of use. The string that loops around your waterproof camera began to fry, deeming it useless if you lose your camera anyways. I would recommend purchasing a better quality floatation device for your camera/what have you. 
5783 3 Great tool for price. It would be a plus if timer had on/off switch. 
5784 4 cannon lens works great. 
5785 1 It doesn t prevent from shaking and swinging while walking and filming. 
5786 4 Very handy and works ! 
5787 4 Nice clear picture. Easy install with longest time taken to route cable. 
5788 4 great entry telephoto lens 
5789 4 nice case. could use a little more pocket room for extra cords 
5790 0 it did not work well it only work for 15 mini and that is all 
5791 0 It broke the first time I used it. 
5792 4 Really good mic! I m very impressed 
5793 4 Great buy on these. Decided to get extra batteries and charger for my Ghostpro camera. 
5794 4 Good product, prompt delivery 
5795 4 Works great, worth more than what I paid for it. 
5796 4 Well made, feels like a tank. Perfect flash for me. 
5797 4 100% advisable 
5798 4 The best! 
5799 4 Excellent 
5800 3 Great product it is my first stabilizer, its all about practice. 
5801 4 If you need an extra battery for your Canon Vixia hf 500r. Order this. 
5802 3 Very happy with the replacement. Only issue I ve had is if you don t dry it properly after submersion, the non-aluminum metal clip will start to rust. 
5803 4 Awesome! 
5804 4 ok 
5805 4 Nice build quality. It can charge larger battery too. 
5806 1 Was sent quickly hover charger was not correct model. Both batteries were correct howe ve charger did not fit these batteries. 
5807 3 Nicer charger than the one originally supplied with my Fuji X100T. Batteries hold a charge nicely & perhaps as long or longer than the original Fuji battery. I d recommend this brand to anyone looking for a replacement. 
5808 0 Beware! This third party Seller does DOES NOT ALLOW ANY RETURNS!!! Make sure this cable is compatible with your particular camera - is works with only select Canon digital cameras. 
5809 4 I LOVE IT CANT WAIT TO REALLY GET STARTED ON TAKES SOME MORE PICS 
5810 4 This is a trippy little thing- Gonna take some learning to master but it is well made and works well. A poor man s steadicam! When you get this take some time to learn it and you will be happy! 
5811 4 ive had this accessory pack for over a month and still continuing to find things that I can use my gopro for! 
5812 3 Very good camara 
5813 4 I love it! The pictures of Winnie the Pooh and tiger and eeyore are so adorable! Buying again! 
5814 4 Perfect! Keeps my camera afloat! 
5815 3 Used for FPV quad racing. Image quality for FPV is poor. Onboard recording is really good quality but that doesn t translate to good picture quality over a wireless FPV link. Do yourself a favor and use the RunCam 600TVL as our FPV camera. HUGE difference! 
5816 4 Very good lens at a reasonable price. 
5817 3 I bought 2 batteries and one did not perform like it was supposed to. I contacted the seller and they sent me 2 more batteries. I am happy! 
5818 4 Excellent for low light street photos. 
5819 4 Great product for my iPhone 6 plus! 
5820 3 Does the job. The fit is a bit tight, as other people have noted, but not too much. All my lenses have managed to get in and out of it ok. 
5821 4 Simple to install and does what it is supposed to. 
5822 4 The camera arrived really fast and I am really exited. Ran to my house and took some pictures with it and the photos are AMAZING. Thanks for the amazing service, fast shipping and an amazing camera!! 
5823 4 WOW! Both my husband and I wear glasses. I have been looking FOREVER to find a product which cleans glasses without leaving the glasses in worse condition with smudges, prisms, and streaks. I have FINALLY found that product. Amazing! 
5824 4 Couldn t wait to get this and I was pleased! Everything I expected. 
5825 4 Makes carrying the camera around so much easier. 
5826 4 This Casio EX -FC150 is everthing that was advertised. From the slow motion which was the main reason why I got it to the snapshot still camera feature. 
5827 2 It s a good product for biggner who just started but I think there are much better ones to use. 
5828 3 Great camera with an easy to use interface. Only problem is that it doesn t come with an SD/memory card. 
5829 3 Excellent desicion. 
5830 4 Cameras finally arrived and were as advertised 
5831 3 Instructions easy to follow. Straight forward to set up internet connection. Only drawback - camera s are outdoor rated, but the power supply transformer requires 120 volt AC is indoor rated. 
5832 4 Awesome!. Bought for photography business -works great with cannon Mark 5Diii JaneB 
5833 4 no problems at all, easiest to set up, and I have set up other brands, excellent amount of components. enough for most homes, the extra siren was a real surprise 5 star rating for sure 
5834 3 Gerat lens, sharp. Weird how tight the focusing barrel is. Had read about it but in practicality is not very good. I only got rid of the lens because I found a Sony 10-18mm for a good deal. 
5835 4 fast delivery service, arrived just as expected! 
5836 3 like 
5837 3 This cable works perfectly and is rugged enough to last a while, very similar to actual Nikon cable. 
5838 3 Looks slightly cheap, but if placed high enough, no one can tell. 
5839 4 awesome camera, works great, great price and got it fast 
5840 4 Very nice camera 
5841 4 Love the camera! It is small enough to fit in my purse or beach bag, but takes great pictures. 
5842 4 I hate to scratch the lcd display on my camera - attaching this gives me peace of mind and I can keep my camera in a pocket so it is handy. It is cheap insurance to protect the display - easy to install and easy to change if required. 
5843 0 Camera did not make clear pictures and did not satisfy me. Very blurry images and wasted very expensive film on this. very disappointed in my purchase. 
5844 4 these are amazing! no need to bring along bulky lighting systems with you... you don t even need a flash on your camera!! harness the natural light of the sun! 
5845 4 Perfect, have a couple of these 
5846 4 My twin granddaughters are getting for their birthday and are thrilled. 
5847 4 The software is a little buggy (the notification checkmark doesn t appear to ever be really clear about what state it s in, and sometimes the video just won t load), but the hardware is excellent and very discrete. 
5848 4 Works Great, I m very happy with it! 
5849 1 Wobbly. Great for stationary video. Terrible for anything in on the go. The clamp is fine, but the swivel mechanism wobbles. 
5850 4 Awesome mount for my ATV 
5851 0 Does not work 
5852 4 When you buy Sony you don t have to worry. 
5853 4 fit for my Fuji X100S camera 
5854 4 I just got this camera and it s awesome. Remember to buy the memory card separate though. It looks, feel and handles perfectly. Worth every darn penny 
5855 3 Works great. no problems so far. 
5856 4 I am very happy with the whole package. I am impressed with the Nikon camera, since I ve only owned Canon. All the accessories were a huge bonus. The price was exceptional for all that I got. 
5857 3 I love these the only thing I can complain about is the price but that s not Amazon s fault they are expensive everywhere you go. 
5858 3 Great light for video And for the price you can t go wrong 😉 
5859 4 Great camera. Easy to use and it takes great pictures. 
5860 4 great buy 
5861 4 These work great and for the price you can t go wrong. truthfully I never thought they d work considering the price difference between this and a pocket wizard, and yes the wizard is nicer and was more features, these things work and work really well. 
5862 4 Excellent quality of vidieos and pictures. Very good resource when at work and recreational use. 
5863 4 ok 
5864 4 Nice edition to a golf cart. 
5865 4 could not find any better product than this one. It s really great and accurate would recommend anyone to buy this especially for the wonderful price dead cheap and very good quality materials. 
5866 4 Excellent product! Extremely satisfied! 
5867 4 great deal and service 
5868 4 Best float strap for any camera. I use it for my gopro with a go poll attached and it still floats 
5869 4 Great camera we love it! 
5870 3 Very good Superb quality lens for 300 focal length ! 
5871 4 Awesome 
5872 4 Perfect size. 
5873 4 Very nice camera, easy to use and to handle, very user friendly, comfortable and cute. 
5874 4 Great product! 
5875 4 I have had this charger for over 3 years. It has always worked well, plugs into any slot. I take it with me when I go on vacation or when I know my battery needs a little juice. 
5876 1 Doesn t look like the photo at all, came in a reddish color and the flap was completely flat without a circular indent for the lens like the picture shows. It s an OK case, just not what I expected or wanted 
5877 4 perfect replacement 
5878 2 Works as advertised. However wished they were not so flimisy. However they work if the glue sticky parts stay to the lens cap 
5879 4 Great product. Screw in easily and the rubber o-ring is great. You don t have to crank down as hard on the gopro to lock in desired angle. Also the screw threads in on first try. Great purchase 
5880 4 These offer a great alternative to the plan white background film. They are bright and fun. I would recommend getting these as I believe they are the same price as the white background. Just a way to add some color and pop to your pictures. 
5881 4 Love this strap 
5882 4 Awesome product. 
5883 3 excellent product, arrived on time, works great so far. i would purchase from this merchant again.very happy with this product, would recommend it to friends. 
5884 4 Saved by Ortho Litho film! 
5885 2 Product is good but i wish it had come with some camera tips video for newbies 
5886 1 I have owned this for less than a month and have discovered that it it used and only charges on one terminal i bought a duel charger which is not duel 
5887 2 I thought it would be a great gift for myself but find that it gets extremely hot. Battery life is less that a hour. I get great video at 4k but anything above is halting. I hope that they fix the heat problem and short battery life. 
5888 0 Gave it a one star because when I received it, it didn t work, if only it had a return address maybe I would give it a higher rating. 
5889 4 excellent product for and excellent price! 
5890 4 I use this whenever I use my underwater camera. I tested it in calm water first and it floated just fine. It s never slipped off so it hasn t been tested in the wild but I have no doubt it would work OK if it did. 
5891 3 Got every thing advertised in excellent codition 
5892 4 Good!! I love it so much!! 
5893 4 Got this for my birthday from my wife to upgrade the dinky factory bag that came with my camera bundle. I really like the amount of room this pack has and easy access for all of your go to accessories. 
5894 4 Great filter and works as described! 
5895 4 Works very well. 
5896 3 Great alternative to the camera strap. Only down side is it came with no instructions. Easy fix with youtube. 
5897 4 works great 
5898 4 Loved them 
5899 4 Worked great. 
5900 0 The quality is beyond poor…and there are Chinese characters on the back of the paper frame, the color is terrible as well. I threw them all. 
5901 2 You have to switch mounts everytime you use a phone or a gopro. Very time consuming. 
5902 4 Very comfortable 
5903 4 Great price 
5904 3 These are pretty nice but I have already lost one due to, I think, they are made flexible and not have a firm mounting. 
5905 4 Delivered on time and very happy with the product. 
5906 2 I don t like how the case has an embroidery of the name &#34;Katia&#34; on the side. 
5907 4 Great camera, takes very nice pictures. Love how its so portable. 
5908 4 Great cable does what it is supposed to at a great price. 
5909 4 A bit overpriced but well designed, and I use it constantly. 
5910 4 Worked perfectly. Exactly like the original. 
5911 0 These just run out of juice too fast!! Only last a couple of days!! 
5912 4 OUTSTANDING camera and a great buy! I highly recommend it!!! 
5913 3 Great product...as advertised. 
5914 0 Felt flimsy. Plastic, light weight. On/Off button sticks. Sent it back. 
5915 2 The image quality is great and it was easy to set up. Very easy to use too. My only complaint is the sound quality. We use it with our iphones and it sounds like you are talking through a tin can. Doesn t bother me enough to return it. 
5916 4 This product is great! Customer support is great! We had a problem with the wrist band, it broke, we sent an email with pic and they sent us a new pole immediately! Thank you! 
5917 4 everything I was expecting and more. I have had a great time taking pictures of old homes and wildlife 
5918 4 Good and nice for my camera 
5919 4 My wife absolutely loves these lens! She is extremely happy with this product. 
5920 4 Works great. 
5921 4 works well, only lost about a half stop of light using if. using it. Did not loose any image quality with this filter. 
5922 3 Memory card and filters and bag useful, the tripod cheap crap 
5923 3 The pack is kind of heavy, but that is to be expected for 23000 mAh. It works well and charges my Surface Pro 3 and Tab 4 with power to spare. 
5924 4 Great addition to my GoPro accessories 
5925 3 Works well as long as you re not in cold weather. 
5926 4 Works great 
5927 4 Very nice travel case! 
5928 4 Works good on LG G4. Even bought the huge Love Mei heavy duty case and it just opened up far enough to fit. 
5929 4 The product is really very portable and convenient, very helpful to my work. 
5930 1 Broke after one year. 
5931 4 Ordered several of these for officers at the police department. They work great, good size to keep with you, and take good pictures. Overall, it s a good little camera for the money and serves the purpose well. 
5932 3 The mounts are good but the screws that come with it are weak (two sheared in half). So my advice is to buy better screws separately. 
5933 0 Did not work at all. 
5934 4 High quality piece! 
5935 2 Quality image fair 
5936 4 Thanks I m enjoying my filters 
5937 3 Quite stable appears to be well made 
5938 2 After period of time batteries slipped out of slot while charging. 
5939 4 Great 
5940 4 It is a bit larger than I expected but rock solid when in use. Very easy to adjust with a Nikon D2x and all lens that I have tried so far (from a 10mm up to 80-200mm). 
5941 0 The product NEVER worked. Battery wouldn t hold a charge and the zoom wouldn t work. Couldn t get any decent pictures. Photos all disappeared every time the battery died. Who thought this one up? 
5942 4 I was using the macro ring flash, the macro lens and my canon camera for my profesional dentistry practice. Works great, fine quality pictures. Very usefull in my dental office. 
5943 4 Great little camera, gets the job done. 
5944 4 i got it turned out i didnt need it.but it worked great 
5945 4 great value 
5946 4 I have a canon rebel t2i, this charger works great for my battery. 
5947 4 Sort of pricey but it does work very well and makes the lens much more user friendly. 
5948 1 nice in theory. Not able to wrap hand around camera and still use shutter button with out loosening grip. 
5949 4 Perfect glass which provides excellent depth of field! 
5950 0 Silly product and has no sleeve. VERY disapointing. 
5951 4 just what we needed at a good price 
5952 4 Looks and feels great.Haven t used it yet 
5953 4 Now I can use mine video recorder... I am one handed. 
5954 4 It fits on both Sony and Sigma E lenses. Doesn t fall off and screws on smoothly. 
5955 4 The cameras work well - and far - during daylight hours. We were so surprised at how well the cameras worked at night! The LEDs do produce a blinding glare if reflecting near glass (or behind glass), but if you can hang them appropriately, they work great at night. 
5956 4 good seller, I recomend 
5957 4 This item was an excellent addition to my videography kit, it allowed me to make smoother more professional shots. 
5958 4 I love this camera can t wait to purchase another one. 
5959 4 I love these battery pouches. They are perfect for my Sony batteries. 
5960 4 AAAAA+++++ 
5961 4 The color is pretty poor, but it s light and tiny and cheap. 
5962 2 Good! It is as described. I ve used it a few times and it s very comfortable to hold. You do get what you pay for so keep in mind this is not a high end grip. 
5963 3 Neat 
5964 1 Stopped working after a week. Should have installed it earlier to enable processing of refined... instead, sat on the dining room table for a month prior to installation... 
5965 4 I bought it after I read good reviews from several books. You can get more info about the meter usage from Youtube. 
5966 0 very Packaging bad and quality bad 
5967 0 All ready malfunctioning 
5968 2 Good case 
5969 4 Great camera that I put to use the minute it arrived. Works beautifully and great pictures! 
5970 4 Fast and true to listing. 
5971 4 Works great on bikes and golf cart! 
5972 4 Very nice product, you can see everything nice and clear and feet any were you want. 
5973 0 Complete scam, f n cons, false advertising,...get a rope! 
5974 0 cant return and has not user manual!! 
5975 4 Works as intended 
5976 4 Love this camera strap, and have gotten a ton of compliments on it! Great quality as well! 
5977 4 great products. Thanks 
5978 2 Good but too small 
5979 4 Perfect fit for my Kodak camera and my computer to download!! Sent right away and packed well!! 
5980 4 good 
5981 2 I believe that this lens will get a high rating once I begin using. Had rotator cuff shoulder surgery and have not used as of yet. 
5982 4 Great value 
5983 4 Perfect! Highly Recommended ☺ 5 ★ STARS ★ Thanks! A+ 
5984 4 ok 
5985 4 battery it s very good, didn t fully tested for longer periods of time but so far seems to be at least the same with the original. 
5986 4 Fit and worked perfectly and super fast shipping! 
5987 4 Great walking around lens! 
5988 3 Seems to fit a little loose and can easily come unplugged - Olympus must know this because they supply a velcro band to attach to your tripod while using... With a little care, it stays in, and works well otherwise.... 
5989 4 Fortunately there support atrocious 
5990 3 good product works fine 
5991 4 Perfect as advertised. 
5992 4 Bought for my Sigma 150-600 S lens. This is better than using the cover that came with the lens when I am in the field. 
5993 4 Good quality, nicely packed, fair price, quick delivery. Great product! 
5994 0 Low quality. Globe just fell off after just a couple of days. 
5995 4 Extremely sturdy but definitely has some tilt smoothness issues. I only trust it for static b-cam shots. EDIT: The seller contacted me immediately upon receiving this review and put in incredible effort to see that I was cared for. I would not hesitate to purchase from them again. 
5996 4 Love my camera! 
5997 4 Switched from mirrorless APS-C to D750, best all around camera! 
5998 4 I had a hard time setting it up but Vincent from Technical support walked me through the setup and got it working. 
5999 4 Nice little case and it works great 
6000 4 Beyond expectations. Great value! This camera is awesome. So many unexpected extras. 
6001 4 AWESOME case for my gopro and accessories. Every gopro owner should have one of these! 
6002 0 The battery I received did not work even after hours of charging. The charger itself felt cheap and unreliable. 
6003 3 I m just starting off with my DSLR but this is an easy camera to use and takes really great pictures. I m still learning to use it but so far I like it. 
6004 4 Handy for when you camera is on the tripod. You ll have no movement in the camera for shots that are zoomed in, or with slow shutter speeds. 
6005 4 The was a very nice fabric back drop. No need to steam or iron either. The colors were vibrant and it looked just like the photo online. I would order a back drop from this company again. 
6006 4 Product arrived on time and was as described. Perfect condition. Thank you ;-) 
6007 2 0ne battery was dead and charger holding pin broke at the first try and can t hold battery uprigth. But Amazon Emailed me asking of it and I tell them about the battery and they had it replaced for free. Amazon takes care. 
6008 4 Awesome. Has made my experience with the x100t even better. Love this conversion! 
6009 4 Totally awesome ! Light weight and fit to any face ! The clarity is perfect ! 
6010 4 Great replacement for missing lens cover. Good value 
6011 4 worked good for taking pictures at a wedding 
6012 4 has already paid for itself in time, quality camera and power for testing cameras, sure beats running in and out of the house to check, just connect to the camera and see where it is pointed. quality tester 
6013 2 Inexpensive, but the image quality is lacking for a 3MP. It is laggish no matter the network and comes in grainy. I have it on a GB network. 
6014 4 I couldn t be happier with this product. I came to amazon looking for a quality product at a decent price and I definitely found it here. No complaints only praises here. Makes me proud to be an amazon shopper. 
6015 2 Within expectation. 
6016 4 A great bag. Plenty of space. Has side pockets for extra space. I bought two of them and hopefully they will last. 
6017 3 Seems to be good, but I haven t figured it out yet. It s higher tech than I am. 
6018 4 good product, so far very good 
6019 2 not verry usefull 
6020 4 Love this thing, almost take it everywhere with me. 
6021 4 I used it with my Kowa spotting scope at the shooting range. Worked great! Used it to photograph the northern likes with my Canon 70D. Worked great! 
6022 1 Not worth the money 
6023 2 Not as clear as hoped 
6024 4 Very good product for the price. Works well, has beginner and advanced mode witch helps when your learning. The camera works well too, audio recording was a surprise. 
6025 1 This camera is only meant to fill in spots with real cameras around. If this is the only camera, everyone will know it is fake after about a week. 
6026 4 Nice photos and solutions 
6027 4 Turned out fine. 
6028 4 So far this is the ultimate drone 
6029 3 Only disappointment was the built-in pop up flash will not work with this in place 
6030 4 Great Camera, and great seller 
6031 4 Gift for someone however they love it. 
6032 1 You get what you pay for. The very first day two of the clips to hold the legs extended snapped. Easily glued back together. You get what you pay for. 
6033 3 Signal as good as 50ft integrated cable. 
6034 4 Fast service, great product and price. 
6035 2 die too quick 
6036 4 love this Camera and will reorder from this company again. 
6037 4 Came on time and works well. 
6038 4 Very affordable, and easy to set up. 
6039 4 Amazing product. Great and easy way to carry an extra lens. 
6040 4 Good quality and good price. Very satisfied. 
6041 0 Within the first week, the main zipper broke. Within about a month all the smaller side pocket zippers were broken. Such a shame because this is a nice looking bag and otherwise sturdy. But you just can t use the bag with ALL zippers broken! 
6042 4 Does what it needs without any fuss. Connecting standard component receiver to plasma with BNC connection. 
6043 4 Got it for my 85 1.8 after a close call almost rubbing the lens on a broken fence when the cheesy hood popped off. Have not noticed any issues with glare or contrast issues. 
6044 4 having tons of fun with this bad boy! 
6045 0 Not ready for prime time. Very poor internet server. As with all internet accessible services, if the company shuts down, its server will and you will have nothing. 
6046 4 A great light pack, low cost Not wanting !!! to ruin your show off pack in the woods, forest, and dirty places we go to fly & film. This is the $30.00 pack to get... 
6047 2 awkward to use. 
6048 4 great deal. very fast shipment 
6049 4 All of them are good 
6050 0 Do not waste $12. Poor quality. Stitching for drawstring closure broke just after two days of use. Small pouch useless; too small 
6051 3 Great camera. 
6052 4 Batteries seem to have a long life and work well. Great inexpensive set! 
6053 3 god 
6054 4 works well 
6055 2 Not to bad, looks almost like my very expensoive real ones which are near to these, J R 
6056 0 this camera doesn t even have a mic port so how can it be for this camera? 
6057 4 Great camera. Does what I need and then some. Particularly love the built-in 42x zoom. Beach Camera provided great service - camera was delivered on time and as promised. 
6058 4 Very sharp, great for low light. Received it before estimated delivery date. 
6059 2 very cheap material compared to original but works fine 
6060 0 Cheap, useless camera. 
6061 4 I got what I expected. 
6062 3 Very good 
6063 0 DO NOT BUY ! I have 3 of these systems and on every system 2 cameras on each system went bad If you know what is good fo you don t buy this junk. DON T BUY!!!!!!!!!!!! 
6064 3 Works fine! 
6065 4 have not fully tested how good they hold charge but seem Ok 
6066 4 excellent product and service 
6067 4 As a gift for a 7 year old boy this was a big hit. Easy to operate. The styrofoam type body won t hurt walls etc 
6068 4 Got these to hang a photo backdrop. They are lightweight but clamp well. 
6069 4 Love that all I need is the paper and do not have to worry about the ink. 
6070 3 Good product 
6071 4 the best drone i ve had up to date, just don t update firmware ! 
6072 4 Great in the field and easy to set up and transport. 
6073 2 I needed to file my helmet mount to make this fit. Once it fit, it was loose inside the mount and rattles slightly. Not a big deal, but not as expected. I plan on eventually buying the brain explodercreations.com version. Looks more thought out. 
6074 4 Gave it as bday present for my sister....she said it s perfectly amazing! 
6075 4 Just what I expected 
6076 0 SO SO SO glitchy. I only get this to record about 30% of the time. Battery life is s***. I hate this helmet camera, it has let me down so many times. 
6077 4 This is a great Security Camera. I really like it!! I had some issues with setting up my system. After calling Amcrest and working with Chris I was good to go. The Customer Service was amazing. Highly recommend this product! 
6078 3 I bought this filter because I have one just like it for my film cameras. This filter is excellent quality and works as it should. Here is the thing though, my Nikon does not seem to need it like my old film cameras do. 
6079 4 Great little batteries and charger! Charge 2 at once. 
6080 0 Very very small 
6081 4 Great camera. Love that it connects to my phone to save pictures. This makes it possible to print better quality pictures when resizing for large pictures. Highly recommend this camera to anyone! 
6082 4 i worked just as advertised, my go pro got knocked out of my boat at it floated fine and was easy to see for retrieval. 
6083 3 We needed to replace a broken light source and these worked well for us in the laboratory. I used one in our biohazard lab and the other in receiving. My people liked the adjustable light source. 
6084 3 Close ups with the macro look really good. Only 4 stars because I really believe the wide angle could be better. 
6085 4 Works great! Use for my gopro hero 4 and have not had any problems! 
6086 4 Worked as expected. 
6087 4 they work as advertised and they ve took plenty of hits and still no cracks 
6088 4 Very helpfull. I could not have done it myself.Thanks Dave 
6089 3 We are still learning how to use it, really wish it had come with instructions, but seems to be all it said to be 
6090 4 Arrived in good condition and is as advertised 
6091 0 This material is is extremely abrasive. Compared to the factory strap (only a few bucks more) it seems to be made from old pot scrubbers. 
6092 4 Flawless. 
6093 4 Awesome bag, my wife loves it. Many compartments, lot of storage space. 
6094 4 Great Value for quality of this camera - bought for my young son and he is loving it. 
6095 1 Its ok. the only bad thing is you have to make sure all the air is out of the space between the lens and the gopro. if not the footage would look like crap. 
6096 3 gets the job done, not great quality but works just fine 
6097 4 Terry Morgan was terrific on support for the 9826. He was very helpful with the excellent Foscam 9826... great cam quality with expert support 
6098 4 perfect! what I needed!!! 
6099 4 Easy to use and takes great pictures 
6100 4 liked it even better than the A77 I have now due to the lower weight and smaller size 
6101 3 Well built, doesn t smell like a cheap knock-off like some products do. Be aware that a Canon Rebel T5i and 2 lenses is a TIGHT fit! The interior is customizable as it comes with padded dividers. 
6102 4 Nice product! 
6103 0 FALSE ADVERTISING. This case does NOT fit Lumix camera, specifically the DMC-G6. This case is too small, and will not physically enclose the camera. Do not waste your time or money. RETURNED. 
6104 4 Simple installation. Quick disconnect guards are great. Only con is that they do affect speed. I also find that on windier days the guards tend to hinder the stability of the quadracopter. All in all a great product. 
6105 3 Great little connectors...my Camera hangs just right now! 
6106 4 delivered on time and as described 
6107 4 The monopod is made of good material, strong, but not heavy. I dive, and it s perfect for a good grip, since the handler is made of rubber. I think i made the best choice 
6108 4 Thank you 
6109 4 My Nikon stopped working. It wouldn t take a charge So I decided that I Needed a new battery. Put your battery in and it works like a charm now. Thanks 
6110 4 It is a very good compact camera 
6111 4 Great eye cups. Seems a little more snug than the others. Hated the first one broke and the 2nd one fell off. If you buy use a little glue to hold it 
6112 4 Threads fit perfectly. Quality is good -- no distortion as best I can tell. 
6113 4 The absolutely best 
6114 4 Bought for vacation and arrived one day before leaving. Small, light, and compact enough for pocket or purse. Easy enough to use without reading directions; however will have to use manual to get full benefit of camera options. Very happy with selection! 
6115 3 Fast delivery and it works 
6116 0 Even at $4 this is a waste of money. The cheap vinyl smells awful, there are loose threads, and the fit is cludgy. Immediately replaced it with a good quality strap for only $12. 
6117 4 Great! And fast! 
6118 4 On time! Highly recommend. 
6119 4 Included magnet. Used it to replace defective door sensor (ADT Safewatch Pro panel). Easy to program replacement S/N. 
6120 4 This adaptor works perfectly with my fuji x cameras. It allows to use both Nikon f and g lenses and even lets me control aperature on the g s. It also looks great and is well made. 
6121 4 Thank you 
6122 4 Very Nice!! Love it 
6123 4 Better than the scope from school, and you can take pics. Works good to keep the children occupied too :&#60;) 
6124 4 Really happy with them. Just what we were looking for! Good service and quick response. 
6125 4 Very easy to set up. Very easy to use. Very easy to pull videos to the computer. Nothing to complain about. It just works. 
6126 4 Very easy to use. It works great. No problems here. 
6127 4 Awesome fit for my Canon Rebel T3 
6128 4 Henry from their support team was very helpful. It was really quick to set up. The Foscam camera is great so far! 
6129 3 Good quality product. Unfortunately if you place a filter on the camera, this no longer fits... 
6130 4 This is VERY nice, not reflective and vibrant color. Also somewhat durable 
6131 4 Very easy to use and very effective also. If you slop food on it, you might need something different, but if you are not a sloppy eater you are good to go. Easy to fit in your bag. 
6132 4 Its what I wanted 
6133 4 Perfect for my Calumet 32 Softbox. 
6134 4 I had bought an expensive one that did not last for very long. I have since replaced with this one and it works perfect. 
6135 4 after several a few try s at setting this up and failing ( user error), I finally got it right. Its a cool little camera. 
6136 2 It meets my needs. 
6137 4 Very good quality product. It s heavy and long with heavy duty attachments. Great price for a such a nice piece. 
6138 4 work fine 
6139 3 Great picture and value for money. It is a very good camera , not heavy, its design makes it very practical. Its great in capturing those unexpected and funny moments. 
6140 4 Product was as advertised. 
6141 4 WORKS GREAT , LOOKS LIKE A REAL TV 
6142 4 Super solid, and really useful. Very happy. 
6143 4 Very good device. A significant improvement in functionality over those available a couple of years ago. 
6144 4 Fantastic lens ! 
6145 4 Manfrotto makes solid part. Not the most affordable of its kind, but it ll last a heck of a lot longer. 
6146 4 Excellent customer service! I had a minor issue and Zomei took care of it immediately. I recommend this company. 
6147 4 The 1-Port power switch is used with our web cameras and is a great product. 
6148 4 Amazing features for a little point and shoot. I m loving the 30x zoom! 
6149 4 It exceeded my expectations... 
6150 4 Good product and a fantastic seller A++++++ 
6151 2 not bad for used cameras did not want to upgrade as I have of these 
6152 4 Fits well on all my other cameras as well as the Canon. 
6153 0 I don t understand why you can t get the one which pops directly on instead, they have this Velcro held diffuser which flies off sometimes, no bueno, it works though ughhh 
6154 1 Menu comes up in chinese and the majority of the interface requires ActiveX. Not compatible with Linux. 
6155 0 Came with an EU adapter. Was unable to use. Did not mention this in the product description! 
6156 4 Nice well made case. The one I had tore after two uses. This one is made of more durable material and has more space for extra batteries and cables. 
6157 0 Hard to set up for recording, I return and switch to some other brand that can record! 
6158 4 Top quality portable backdrop for shooting portraits. 
6159 4 I ve got a G5, running 5.0 and with CameraFi it works fine. There are other setup out there I m sure, however, this one is working for me. 
6160 4 Great lens, I love it. I second all the positive things being said already. 
6161 3 Great product for the price 
6162 0 Not easy to assemble. 
6163 4 great product 
6164 0 The picture of this charger shows it as a dual charger for charging 2 batteries at once. I ordered 2 since I have 6 batteries I keep charged for my professional photography business. I was sent two standard plug in chargers. This is false advertising! Buyer Beware!! 
6165 4 Great kit to go along with the go pro. You get so many pieces for a great price. Glad Amazon recommended that I bundle! Husband has had lots of fun using all these accessories with his go pro! 
6166 0 If you try to figure out how to work this thing-good luck! Whoever translated the instructions from the Chinese obviously forgot to learn English! It s indecipherable goobledygoop. 
6167 4 Excelente 
6168 4 This is a great set of photo or video lights for a great price. It has greatly improved our picture quality. 
6169 4 Love this product! Extends the recording time of a 3/3+ camera almost by 4, making them a lot more usable. 
6170 4 An excellent product. Operates exactly as described. I appreciate greatly. YES I WOULD RECOMMEND this product to friends and colleagues. 
6171 4 Excellent. Works great. Got at least eight hours out of it. 
6172 4 I love my JVC Camcorder let s me record my favorite shows! 
6173 4 I love this camera and bundle! 
6174 4 Worked very well and received in a timely fashion. 
6175 4 So happy to get a replacement battery charger for our camera since ours was lost on vacation. 
6176 1 It did what it was supposed to do. Sadly it came off very easily. Eventually it was lost and never seen again. 
6177 4 Purchased as a spare battery. Battery is compact and has a good mAh rating. Both this battery and the orginal take 3.5 hours to recharge inside the camera compartment. Nikon should have bundled MH-65 with the camera instead of this cumbersome USB charger. 
6178 3 I didn t want to lug around a big hefty camera bag. This one is perfect size for my Sony RX10. And there is plenty of storage room for some lens cloths, extra SD cards, lens brush and more. I also like the solid quality of the bag. 
6179 3 works great. love that it has a strap so you won t lose it 
6180 4 This was a perfect upgrade for me! Thank you! 
6181 4 Replacement for a camera that stopped working after 4 years in Las Vegas outdoors. 
6182 2 Good camera. It has worked well after my lady figured out the many functions. Stars were withheld because no product manual was provided with camera. The online manual effort was completely frustrating. 
6183 4 Powerful flash 
6184 4 Outstanding!!! Best Tripod ever! Tried many, this one is beyond any of them, 5 stars SOLID, 
6185 4 Excellent for ultra compact cameras! 
6186 3 It is a nice lens filter, comes in a nice case. 
6187 4 Great for the money. Somewhat easy to setup and customize. You MUST have a PC monitor initially to setup & run this system. However once setup you can view and record from your mobile or from a secondary program on laptop. 
6188 4 Very handy to use and read the information I need to. 
6189 4 vgreat 
6190 3 It fit my 18-55mm lens 
6191 3 They don t last as long as the actual GoPro battery, but these are cheap and useful. 
6192 4 Perfect 
6193 2 Battery life is marginal. Was hoping for much better. 
6194 4 Exactly what I needed - works exceptionally well. 
6195 4 Love It ! 
6196 4 I like it 
6197 4 I anticipate that when I make it operation, this camera will fully meet my security needs Just installed with excellent help from Walter 
6198 4 Fits perfectly, made by nikon, not much more to say. Does it s job protecting the rear. 
6199 0 Broke less than 2 fays after receiving this product. Not happy with this service at all. 
6200 4 I am just learning to use a DSLR, but this seems to be a great choice with the ability to go fully automatic, but also various manual settings as well. Very light weight and compact for a DSLR.I am pleased with it so far. 
6201 0 The bundle did not come with the camera wall mount like shown in the picture and also in the description. Contacted company and the response I received back was that the bundle did not come with any additional lenses (I was not asking for a lense). 
6202 1 return 
6203 0 Worst instructions ever seen. Can t understand how to set time or clear value memory. Maybe the instructions are for a different model. 
6204 4 Like this camera, bought it used on Amazon. Only problem I ve encountered is occasionally it will take two pictures in a row when I push down button to take a picture 
6205 4 I love this lens. The quality of the photos is excellent with beautiful clarity. The wide angle works great for places with a wide field of view such as the New York City skyline. I am amazed at some of the photos I have gotten with this lens. 
6206 4 Good product. 
6207 4 works great, good price versus factory batteries 
6208 3 This has improved the quality of my photographs and YouTube videos. 
6209 4 This is an awesome camera. Just about the closest you can get to a digital SLR without the size and weight. The ability to connect via wireless to my phone is an added bonus. 
6210 3 Seems like good quality! Very handy to have 
6211 3 Works well. Wish the trigger was integrated. I fixed that by slipping it through the tether. Got it on sale for $1.00 with free Prime Shipping so it is hard to complain. My son has enjoyed it. 
6212 4 Great purchasing experience 
6213 4 Those guys who have stabilizer must Buy ITem 
6214 4 So far, a solid product. It s small, portable and gets the job done. 
6215 4 What can I say Teenager! 
6216 0 Worked fine for a day. I originally purchased this for a trip out of the country. The day I was leaving I tested the camera and it wouldn t work. Ended up having to buy another camera last minute. Not happy with this purchase at all. 
6217 4 Exelent purchase, no more head pain. Light, and nice price 
6218 3 Great case but I wish it had a place for my steadyGrip. 
6219 4 Just like the original from Canon 
6220 4 Love the color, and this camera is a lot of fun for my friends and me. 
6221 4 Good 
6222 4 Works well. 
6223 3 Great case with plenty of padding and compartments. It is a little bit larger than I expected. This case is a little better suited for cameras bigger than mine. I still like the case though! 
6224 0 I was very happy at first. I installed the battery and everything seemed great until I tried to charge it. Thats when i figured out I got ripped off. Very disappointed. I have a new battery that I can t charge. 
6225 4 Good quality Rapid shipment 
6226 4 Great rate 
6227 4 Very useful bag. Lots of compartments. 
6228 3 Should have some more views and 2-3 days to check event on the free version. I miss different user permissions, just to allow them to disconnect the alarm when they are close to the device or make it able by time. 
6229 4 It was as described and worked perfectly charging my batteries. All parts were included and shipped promptly. 
6230 4 great product. Fits the screen! 
6231 4 Took this to Alaska and got some amazing whale and grizzly bear shots! 
6232 4 works great!!!! 
6233 4 Excellent product! Met my expectations 
6234 4 Took this into the pacific ocean and not a single drop touched my camera! It also fits Nikon Coolpix L30 
6235 2 Sometimes it goes off for no reason at all and other times it doesn t go off at all. 
6236 4 My husband bought this camera to replace on that just gave up the ghost! It takes movies and wonderful photos! 
6237 4 Great price point. Meets expectations. Incredibly easy to use and save pictures and videos. 
6238 4 Nice 
6239 0 Don t bother getting this. It arrived already broken and felt fragile anyway. Not worth the money if it even did work. 
6240 4 great product 
6241 4 As good as a cheap lens cap gets. 
6242 4 Daugher loved the gift, but it did not work. The return process was VERY easy, would buy from seller again! Thanks! 
6243 3 Good addition 
6244 3 The camera takes very sharp pictures. It is very easy to use. It fits very nicely in my hand, The only con is that the flash seems a little slow 
6245 4 Packaged neatly & works great! 
6246 2 Doesn t take good pictures when it s sunny outside, kinda a waste of a money in my opinion 
6247 3 Fits a little snug on my XE-2 
6248 1 While this is a terrific idea, the adhesive gave way by the second time I took the lens cap off. I am keeping them to see if I can find another way to make it stick. Other than that they are easy to &#34;install&#34; and they arrived quickly. 
6249 3 do not seam to hold a charge as long as original canon batteries. 
6250 4 Works great 
6251 4 Reasonable price for a rare product. 
6252 4 Great product delivered as advertised. 
6253 4 Works Great!!! 
6254 4 Great buy. No one even notices it. Video clarity is outstanding. 
6255 4 Love this product. 
6256 1 Purchased it thinking to record while walking around but the videos are just too shacky to be watched. A stabilizer is the best options. 
6257 4 Really nice kit. Happy happy with it. 
6258 3 Good Product Works as expected 
6259 2 The piece attached to lens cap separated. Almost lost my lens cap. 
6260 2 so so~ 
6261 4 Perfect little stand. I use it for long exposure shots on my Galaxy Camera which come out great. I can also use it for the auto timer feature. 
6262 0 Did not work on my pc. Instructions are confusing therefore will be returning the product. 
6263 4 Great Product Fast Delivery!! 
6264 4 The product was exactly as promised and works great, thanks! 
6265 4 Relive the joy of toys, without the hassle of aerodynamics, with this brilliant piece of work 
6266 4 Great device. 
6267 4 Very happy with this camera! 
6268 3 works good 
6269 4 Thank you for your persistance and finding the right part AWESOME 
6270 3 Good quality, A little pricey but as an original accesory you get what you pay for. 
6271 4 I REALLY liked it. I used the album to create a scrapbook for a recent cruise. Perfect! 
6272 4 Fit perfectly into a case I already owned. Foam customized to my needs without any problems at all. 
6273 4 great 
6274 3 Nice product a little bigger than I would have liked 
6275 1 I consider it false or disingenuous advertisement to advertise a wireless system, especially for DIYers, that doesn t include the essential wireless component, the Wifi Module communicator that enables the system to &#34;communicate wirelessly! &#34; It s another charge for the Wifi module communicator. 
6276 0 This bag rip the third day I use it. The material isn t hat good. I recommend buying a professional one and not this cheap one! i have a canon t5i with an extended battery pack. 
6277 4 Good stuff! 
6278 4 Bought it for a friend and the feedback was more than amazing! 
6279 3 good 
6280 4 Good 
6281 4 Camera works great after dealing with D-Link agent (AR004636) Case ID C6719807. Hazel was fantastic. 
6282 1 Not very good. The metal port got stuck in my laptop port second time I used it. Video isn t bad. It s just made like crap. 
6283 3 Love my gadgets thanks 
6284 4 Best camera strap ever!!!! 
6285 4 Awesome camera! takes amazing photos and video! 
6286 1 I bought this looking for a durable tripod for my ipod and this wasn t a very good product. The legs get very thin at the bottom and it is cheap and unstable. I would advise to spend a little more money to buy a better one. 
6287 4 comfortable, simple, useful 
6288 4 Dlivery was fast, and the product works 100% as expected. 
6289 4 Good quality for an upgrade from the nifty fifty which I also own...Better glass (to me) and love the stm system especially on my 70D. 
6290 4 Great product. Voltage and percent charges displays very helpful. Fast delivery and great customer service 
6291 3 Generally works great, but sometimes, without cause, the camera goes out and requires that it be unplugged, wait 10 or more seconds, and replugged. 
6292 2 The hook came off within few days of use. 
6293 4 Very pleased with these. The light with a speedlight wad great. 
6294 0 Product showed up dead on arrival wouldn t power on, tried to return with no luck 
6295 1 not as good as expected, case is large enough for intended use with GoPro and accessories; however, the zipper malfunctioned on initial use. no wont open without having to hold the zipper in place so not to further tear. very disappointing... 
6296 4 Came in handy. When my other battery died. I like to have this handy when i m with the kids on the road. 
6297 4 Item as described! Works great! 
6298 4 Works great with my Olympus E-M! and FL600 flash system. 
6299 4 good stuff 
6300 3 This product is great love it it is really better than a gopro compared to the price I am in love with it I use it all the time just some of my parts fall apart but is is still great 
6301 4 Great battery performance, great purchase value, love the external battery charger. 
6302 4 Good product. Fast shipping. 
6303 2 some of the balls keep coming off. 
6304 4 this was great better batteries than what came with the camera so happy with this 
6305 2 Cheesy but works and at low price. Works for the few times a year for crowd control or people mover. 
6306 4 Love this lens. 
6307 0 READ ALL THE ONE STAR COMMENTS. THEY ARE ALL TRUE. THIS CAMERA IS NOW BEING SOLD FOR A FRACTION OF THE ORIGINAL COST BECAUSE IT WILL NOT WORK AFTER A FEW DAYS OR WEEKS. SAVE YOUR MONEY DONT BUY EVEN FOR $5. 
6308 1 defective on surface, make unusable for professional use, as metal scuff, or little dents or cracks make base bump. Try another model type that couldn t get easily damaged......well China low quality products and poor model design some times make things bad. 
6309 0 Cheaply made...The shaft broke after one us...... 
6310 4 Got these two batteries really quick and they work really well for the came I would buy them again 
6311 4 I bought this charger for my daughter s sony camera and the first one they shipped didn t work, I contacted them and they quickly shipped me a new one and it works perfectly!! Very satisfied and good customer service 
6312 2 Makes DJI phantom professional very unstable... 
6313 4 Charges holds change and works in my camera. 
6314 4 Much more padding than expected. Great bag. 
6315 4 Perfect just as described, great price! 
6316 1 this case is really too small for the Sony Cyber shot for which I bought it. :o( 
6317 3 I feel like is to plastic, but it does its job which is what you want, correct? 
6318 4 grandaughter loves the camera, especially the double exposure........... 
6319 3 A good versatile lens but not as sharp as I hoped in the 150-250 mm range. Still a good travel lens. 
6320 0 The thumbscrew was missing for the gopro stand and the thumbscrews that originally came with my gopro hero3+ weren t compatible for some reason- which is too bad. It s really light and would have been great for backpacking trips. 
6321 4 Excelente 
6322 4 This bag is conveniently sized, well-constructed and has ample space for for my wife s Nikon Coolpix P600 while providing some space for small accessories, etc. and most importantly protection for the camera. 
6323 2 Goes through batteries pretty quick 
6324 4 Purchased for my Canon G-15, fit perfectly and worked great on my vacation. 
6325 4 Good quality I m glad I bought it and for the price you can t beat it 
6326 0 The camera works great 
6327 4 C6722013 TECH ID AR004273 Henry was very helpful and patient. His English was not the very best but it was a fun venture and I like the product as well:) 
6328 4 This was a purchase for myself and I have found it as advertised and a good purchase. The seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with. 
6329 3 it works well 
6330 1 This product is built using low quality plastic. The maximum syn speed is only 1/160s. If you are looking for a higher syn speed like me, you will be very disappointed. 
6331 3 good product seems to work for now will recommend to friends 
6332 4 I m using it mostly for checking out the cool, binocular-viewable bits of the universe, but of course they re usable for anything. Price is great, quality is great, I d recommend them to whoever. 
6333 4 Great video from a easy to use camera! 
6334 0 Bag is small size, and zipper fell so tight, hard to pull, return and take so long for process a refund. I m totally not happy with this seller.... 
6335 3 I really like this case! I didn t need a huge one just enough for my everyday uses. It holds my camera and my extra lens along with some misc stuff. but it was exactly what I wa looking for! 
6336 4 Sensors works very good. Amazed by the effectiveness. 
6337 4 plenty of room for my stuff except for the extended stick but other than fits everything else! 
6338 4 very nice. 
6339 4 Great night black and white picture. Great color in daylight. 
6340 4 great price for a nice camera and kit 
6341 4 Perfect replacement eye piece for my Nikon! 
6342 4 very high quality and easy to use micro tripod. I am using it for Olympus Micro four thirds camera. Both for PM2 and OMD EM10. easy to use and carry. I always carry it attached to camera 
6343 4 Works great! 
6344 4 Very good. Better than expected. 
6345 4 Works well, so far. Why pay more? 
6346 0 Does not attach or fit properly. 
6347 3 glad to find film for special project. 
6348 2 Good scope for bird watching and the like. My Kids love playing with it and learning how to focus and find stuff in the wild. Does what it says- a spotting scope. 
6349 4 fits perfect. So far no issues 
6350 0 spent a few hours this past weekend trying to balance it - fail. bought the roxant pro instead - balanced in minutes. 
6351 4 Just as described. Fast delivery. Large. Great for portraits. 
6352 0 It did not work at all. Do not buy. 
6353 4 love it 
6354 4 Great camera case for a great price. It is well made and sturdy and fits a small point and shoot camera. The camera I bought it for was just a bit too large, but otherwise the case is great. 
6355 3 the clip is good. The headstrap is good but after awhile i cut it off and diy on a hat( it will look way better ) and i think you can buy a aftermarket bundle. It cheap and will funtion the same. 
6356 4 super cool strap 
6357 4 This is a fantastic camera and worth the extra money. The quality of the pictures is amazing! I bought a factory refurbished one and have had no issues with it. It has performed flawlessly. You will be very happy with this camera. 
6358 4 great 
6359 1 It shows in my 18-55 at the lower range focal lengths and the threading is weak. Dont get it for short lenses. 
6360 4 Best head strap ever! 
6361 0 The product didn t work and I contacted Foscam two times and they have not responded to me. 
6362 1 They didn t have the size I needed so It was a waste. But the product seems to be good. 
6363 2 This did the job for my SJ4000. After a while, the center piece to mount it started breaking, but it still works well. I use it often. 
6364 4 OK 
6365 3 I love this charger, really fast. The only thing I don t like is 100% is not really 100% on the battery, it s more like 87 to 93%. 
6366 4 I haven t used it yet but it looks and stands great! Assembling it was a piece of cake! I just bought this for my daughters first!! 
6367 4 Its very good! 
6368 4 Love this bag 
6369 4 Love it 
6370 3 Lens does all that it is supposed to, but some of your customized settings (aperture) have limits compared to a Nikon lens. 
6371 4 Makes your gear look pro, and I wouldn t part with it for anything! 
6372 4 Excellent 
6373 4 Great product. Works flawlessly in daylight and at night. 
6374 4 No complaints here works like the original ones. Love the dual charger too 
6375 4 Great lens. 
6376 1 Its so dificult instol softweare. I m sorry but I returned back. 
6377 4 Working great! Using this with a Nikon D70 and have had no issues so far. 
6378 4 Great product 
6379 3 Good product at a reasonable price. 
6380 4 Item worked just as expected and arrived very quickly! 
6381 1 Had this battery for about 6 months now. Worked for 2 or 3 charges, now no longer accepts a charge, so its pretty much useless already. 
6382 4 Look real and self adhesive. 
6383 4 ONE OF THE BEST PURCHASES I VE MADE YET 
6384 4 Works quickly and the batteries last as well as the Canon brand. 
6385 3 Great product! The only downside is the polaroid picture is the size of a credit card, which is small and not the normal size of polaroid. 
6386 2 Quality not so good 
6387 4 Great little item...just what I wanted...and great service as well. 
6388 3 It s convenient that it folds up, but it s a bit wonky trying to get it closed up. Takes some practice. 
6389 4 Very easy to use. I love it. It adds the prefect flash. Very compatible with the Canon Rebel. It is easy on batteries and allows for modification right on the lens. Super quick to change the settings and I appreciate that. 
6390 4 We have a Sony Alpha SLR camera, these fit perfectly! 
6391 4 I have two other LUMIX cameras with the string attached caps. This cap is so much more appropriate for shooting. It performs as promised and looks great. I cannot understand why it was no included in the kit. 
6392 4 Beautiful and well made 
6393 4 Not expensive and it works 
6394 4 thanks 
6395 4 Originally I purchased the Neweer brand but it s too big and doesn t fit in left side. I found this Morros and it s perfect fit for my DLSR Canon 6D. You can install either left or right and fits perfectly. 
6396 4 Now I need 4 more :) 
6397 3 Great minimal bag for sure, (it s smaller than it looks online) but my new Sony a7r mark ii just barely doesn t fit with the Zeiss 1.8 55mm lens attached. Go bigger to the &#34;plus&#34; version of this bag, I think it s the 625. 
6398 4 thank you 
6399 3 Everything ok until Now ! 
6400 0 I had to return because the cameras are not compatible with windows 8 
6401 4 I used this lens paired with t3i and it did a wonderful job! Got it for a family visit from out of the country. We went to see so many sights and 35 mm was perfect! 
6402 4 Great little camera. Easy to setup the app works very very well 
6403 3 It works 
6404 4 It is the same old simple light behind the film viewer that does its job simply and well. That is what I had 50 years ago. It worked well then and still does today. What more is there to say? 
6405 4 Seems fine; pictures still in camera, yet the video works great for streaming! 
6406 3 Great lens, I forgot that it weighs as much as my 70-200, only shorter, much slower 
6407 4 Well made I love them 
6408 4 This is such a fun camera. Totally took me back to my childhood. The pictures are great and having them right away was the best part. I wish the film role held more than 10 pics, but the novelty of it all made it worth it. 
6409 3 We love our camera and use it daily! 
6410 4 Works well but I have not put my go pro on high speed risky situations. 
6411 3 works just fine, but the batteries seem to have a short life 
6412 4 I really like the look and feel of this bag. Build quality is good - zippers, pockets, and handles/straps feel very solid. This bag is perfect for a small camera. Highly recommend. 
6413 3 I wish the slides moved out easier, but other than than it works great for what I need. 
6414 3 The lighting might be tough to dial in. I ve had a few that were too dark and one that was too light, but it s a super fun little camera. 
6415 3 It looks really cool, works too. 
6416 4 It works good. Looks like an original. 
6417 4 works great thanks 
6418 4 Fabulous! 
6419 4 Nice option this is the second set of these I have purchased the first set still works fine. I use them as single straps but it is nice to have an option if I ever need to strap them together. 
6420 4 Great filter Kits! Exactly as described .. quick, fast delivery! Would order again! 
6421 4 Awesome stick, very sturdy, I use it all the time and it is great! 
6422 3 Work good, easy to set up (installing your own hard drive). The quality of the video could be better and the user interface isn t the easiest to use but all in all it s ok. 
6423 4 -so much easier than binoculars- 
6424 4 Decent quality. Might only take one or two out with me. 
6425 4 Cheap protection. If you want to preserve resale value for your Canon equipment, this is an excellent option. 
6426 4 Fit nicely on my lens without intrusion. 
6427 4 Looks great! 
6428 3 received in good order; slightly better capacity than OEM battery with camera 
6429 4 The picture is nice and clear. I really like the thin frame because it makes the pictures look even bigger. 
6430 3 Still getting use to this. Wouldn t let me download app to my Iphone but takes great pics 
6431 4 Prompt Delivery & Intact package. I ordered this cable to use on Foscam camera, I ordered & it worked without any issue. 
6432 4 I bought one Setup Adapter Ring: 52mm - 58mm. It arrived on time. I haven t used it yet, but it looks fine. i m from Venezuela. Thanks. 
6433 4 works great 
6434 4 Worked good 
6435 4 Very powerful. If your camera is less than 10 meters away use something smaller. This will blind most short range applications 
6436 2 Very nice lense 
6437 4 It is very nice 
6438 4 must buy for go pro, hope the next one would have a more modern look. 
6439 4 Great price 
6440 4 good deal! 
6441 4 Everything I needed and wanted. Thanks! 
6442 4 Excellent Product, highly recommended!! 
6443 1 The quality of the product I received was sub par - the screws weren t properly fitted and the build quality is bad - The shoe mount on the bottom is loose. Unhappy with the product. 
6444 4 I was told by mistake that my home alarm system needed a new backup battery but that was not the case. Oh well, now I have a backup battery in case I need one. Bobby B 
6445 4 Amazing very well crafted feels extremely sturdy 
6446 4 Volume is a bit low but otherwise works well. 
6447 4 I purchased this Manfrotto 128RC Head for my Canon Vixia S20 video camera. Very smooth, and as a bonus, it comes with two extra QR mounts. Would buy again. 
6448 4 Perfect replacement for OEM batteries 
6449 4 My daughter loves it!!! 
6450 4 buen producto 
6451 4 VERY NICE 
6452 4 Good quality, very happy. 
6453 4 Fast shipping, the camera is very easy to use and comes with so many accessories, the video and pictures came out nice! definitely worth the money... 
6454 2 Did not come with any instructions on the parts. 
6455 4 I simply love it. 
6456 3 A little clumsy to use but overall works very good. I use this with gradient ND filters and it allows me to adjust it to the position I want. 
6457 2 lens is to small 
6458 4 Nice Kit 
6459 4 These are fun! I have gotten to take some pretty cool pics with them.. I am planning on using them for a wedding photo shoot ( which is what I bought them for) in the near future. 
6460 3 The only reason I don t give it five stars is that I ve only had it two days. It charged my four RED Bricks from 0 charge in about four hours. For the price It seems to be great. Great build quality. So fingers crossed that it will last... 
6461 4 Work great thanks for the quality 
6462 4 fair for the price 
6463 4 This was a gift for my dad. He loves it! It works great and is nice and small. He has a chest strap and a strap to go on his hat, both of which it works great with!! 
6464 4 Looks great in my family room - very unobtrusive. 
6465 4 This camera is amazing. Easy to set-up and easy to use with my I-phone. Great picture and I can receive updates on my phone if it sences activity in the room where the camera is. Love it!! 
6466 4 easy to use 
6467 4 Danny was very helpful and did an excellent job! camera is very good and functions well! 
6468 4 Single-handedly makes the EOS-M useful. 
6469 4 It was exactly what I was looking for..... 
6470 4 Very fast good deal 
6471 4 Great product for deterrent. 
6472 4 Exactly what I needed and got it early! 
6473 4 Perfect 
6474 4 Nice extra gopro batteries. The wrapping makes it a little tight to fit into the duel charger, but very very slight inconvenience that I am ok with. Little accessories was a bonus! +++ 
6475 4 The best paper trimmer! 
6476 4 Great product 
6477 4 Needed to upgrade Firmware !!! 
6478 1 It did not quite work for the eos as it completely covered the dial for focusing the viewfinder. Bummed. 
6479 3 Nice screen size good viewing angle and pic quality. 
6480 4 Received the flash as described and promptly! Works fine on my Nikon D3200. Great price and good quality. 
6481 4 Perfect for filming skateboarding. 
6482 4 nice & easy to use seems to stay on well. 
6483 4 Really a great beginners drone. Lots of fun, wish the batteries last longer 
6484 4 I used it for my Jamberry storage and I love it. The black background contrasts nicely with the nail shields. Now I just need my order to come in from Jamberry! 
6485 4 I love this camera. It works wonderfully. When mine died I was heartbroken. I m so glad I found this one. 
6486 3 I got quite a lot for my money, the chest piece is the most used and very very comfortable and steady taking great pics and video with my go Pro 3+ 
6487 4 does as advertised. difficult to find locally 
6488 0 honestly didn t really like it can t see what you re recording the instructions are hard to follow. it s nice and all but wouldn t buy it again 
6489 4 This camera is amazing I upgraded from the gopro and will never go back. The tube design works great with my helmet and weapons. It also makes a great low profile dash cam. 
6490 4 It is a very good camera. 
6491 4 It is as advertised. Fits my 18-200mm VR II and will snap in place reversed. It is the one piece version not like the cheaper ones that have to attach by a ring. Pay another $10 and be satisfied.[[ASIN:B000C0QGAQ Nikon HB-35 Lens Hood (Bayonet) for 18-200mm AF-S Lens]] 
6492 3 Great quality images and optics, was just too heavy for what I wanted to use it for. 
6493 4 Good so far. Good quality resolution. 
6494 1 very difficult to make sense of the instructions for playback. I used this for the birth of my Great Granddaughter so I don t want to return it because I don t want to lose the footage. 
6495 4 All good 
6496 3 Nice 
6497 4 Already used in 3 dives, works great. 
6498 3 Perfect for HDM Z1 CPAP Machine 
6499 4 Everything I expected. I m glad I received it very fast. The pieces are of good quality. Can t go wrong! 
6500 3 Bought this for my daughters Powershot. Great construction and extra pocket for battery charger 
6501 4 Great! It comes with User guide and in perfect status. 
6502 0 2 years later and it s totally dead, I can get about 5 pictures on a full charge. I kept it as a secondary battery and it got little use and then when I really needed it nothing. 
6503 3 Good cheap tripod and selfie stick, but the tripod is wobbly due to the small feet. 
6504 3 Have not bought any film in 15 years so my supply of these was eventually exhausted. Very handy for screws and various other small things. The tops take a bit of effort to get off and seem to be better made than the aging Kodak canisters. 
6505 4 Now I can go through old negatives and slides and make prints for my family. 
6506 0 There is no off switch You must remove the battery to turn it off 
6507 4 Excellent product! Fast delivery! We can now talk to each other clearly and not shoit down the stairs! Thank you! 
6508 4 Light weight and small. Great for my trip. 
6509 0 The camera would not turn on. 
6510 4 Love it get here just in time to see the meteor shower that is tonight 
6511 4 very good 
6512 3 Great deal 
6513 4 Works well. Love the length and does not tangle 
6514 3 I knew what I wanted/needed, saw it, and now have it! 
6515 4 Fits like a glove and looks OEM. 
6516 3 Easy to use. Great detail 
6517 1 Ordered two cords... one was fine. The other did not work. I checked the system w a different cable and it worked fine. Just a bad cable. 
6518 2 The first Phottix had a great wired cord that lasted several years, Today no matter where I buy them including Phottix they fail after a couple times. 
6519 3 Great camera with plenty of options 
6520 4 Exactly what it s says it is. 
6521 0 it doesn t focus properly at all..total waste of money 
6522 4 Has all the screws needed for my Phantom 2. I had stripped s few and needed some replacements. This pack had them all. 
6523 4 Great product. Would definitely buy from this supplier again. 
6524 4 Smooth and flawless operation. Works great with my manfrotto tripod! 
6525 4 Does everything I asked for. Easy to setup. I use it every day. 
6526 1 cheap 
6527 0 Camera will not work right out of the box the pictures and videos are full of horizon lines .Well got my replacement and guess what it is worse then the first one it is a shame that such a good flying drone have a peace of junk camera 
6528 4 Great product! It is exactly like the expensive versions. It s crazy how that can be. 
6529 4 Fast delivery and received what was purchased 
6530 0 Waste of money, and will drain battery s fast. Not functional at all. 
6531 3 Not as stable as it looks but overall I am very happy with the purchase. Not bad for this Price. 
6532 1 poor quality. very cheap made you get what you pay for. 
6533 4 Well worth the money 
6534 4 Good. For my camera. 
6535 0 Sorry... but this is a piece of junk -- do not buy it -- I was stupid for not believing the reviews. 
6536 4 Quick shipment....item as described .....Thank You! 
6537 3 The Pentax X-5 digital camera fits nicely in here, on its side. The pouches are roomy enough for memory cards and batteries. The padding is ample and the camera feels well protected. Overall, a good value. 
6538 4 easier and cheaper than other brands with great quality 
6539 4 great seller - delivered as promised! 
6540 4 Very easy to add to my Hensel equipment. Works like a champ. 
6541 4 Awesome camera great accessories but the bag won t hold everything. 
6542 4 Got what I wanted 
6543 4 Perfect fit, integrated look, very secure grip! 
6544 2 The first set I purchase were nice but the 2nd set I got wasn t so nice... will add a picture of it to show what I mean 
6545 0 Junk!!! 
6546 4 Good price 
6547 4 My husband was able to fit his keys, iPhone 5 (inside an Otterbox defender case), and his full wallet in the case. It fit nicely under the bungee cords of his SUP. Everything stayed dry while paddle boarding. 
6548 4 works well and is handy to have 
6549 4 Great magnifier and light, the versatile magnetic base is a plus. 
6550 4 Works...thanks. 
6551 4 Great Product! 
6552 4 Worked great the first night we took it out to an outdoor location. 
6553 4 Very functional, light, and easy to position on my belt. 
6554 4 Epic!!! nice 
6555 4 Product arrived quickly and worked as advertised. 
6556 4 Very useable and works perfectly with my Canon Camcorder. 
6557 4 Cheapest find for Film. The more you buy at lie time the better the deal. 
6558 4 Works great and the price was certainly right. 
6559 4 Excellent item for my photography studio and at an excellent price. The instruction manual is also in color a rarity in this cost cutting world we live in now. 
6560 0 No good sound 
6561 4 Very stable even though I have no rc experience. In not saying it is easy to fly for me, but that s not the quads fault. Everything worked as is should, no issues with seller, shipping was fast, and I even bought a second quad for my spouse. 
6562 3 Nice camera 
6563 4 it was cheap and it allows me to use my camera 
6564 4 Fits my Nikon D300s 
6565 4 Seems to be Just as good at a way cheaper price... Perfect purchase for my super surfing videos 
6566 4 Love Them. 
6567 2 We have installed the security system, it will meet our need. The only disappointment is I thought the system did not require a land line, but it does. 
6568 4 Very helpful in teaching me all the tools that I have on my camera 
6569 0 Returned 
6570 4 These are great so far. Have used them numerous times and do not get any fog on my Go pro case - These are very inexpensive compared to the other brand 
6571 4 great transaction. Product as described 
6572 4 Awesome product 
6573 4 LOVE THIS THING!!! Only one drawback, it drains the battery quick. 
6574 4 Very good! Good design and price point. 
6575 4 Love it works great:-) 
6576 4 nice item 
6577 4 Great package, the right amount of needed accessories. It came on time, in great condition, and i am pleased with the quality. Highly recommend it. 
6578 4 For this price!!! Awesome! But it is not carbon fiber! It is aluminum but works great! 
6579 4 Best tripod on the market for the price! Does stuff even the Mephoto tripods don t do for half the price. 
6580 4 Meets my need for a high quality and affordable polarizer filter for my new Panasonic DMC-FZ200. 
6581 0 So disappointed in this camera. The picture quality is poor and operating it is difficult. 
6582 4 Genuine Battery. Initially I was after a Japan made one. However, long story short. This one works well, couldn t see a difference with my other Japan made one. Now a days all are made in China even the one one you get with the camera. 
6583 0 useless. I returned it 
6584 4 Great remote control &#34;Master&#34;, simple to use. 
6585 4 working very well, glad you could provide products 
6586 4 Loved them very professional 
6587 4 Very good!! 
6588 4 Product as described, fast shipping, very pleased! 
6589 1 Good idea to create this, but build quality is really bad. It cannot securely lock with the small plastic attachment. 
6590 4 Excellent product 
6591 4 Very happy with the products and how quick they got here. Used the batteries and chargers that day. 
6592 4 Pleased with the order..:) 
6593 4 I LIKE IT ! 
6594 4 These are awesome and I love that I can just screw them on to my other lenses. 
6595 4 Neat product that allows customizing the setting on Sigma lenses 
6596 4 Worth the money!!! Buy the protection plan if you buy the camera!!! 
6597 4 Easy, fast, good product. 
6598 4 Excellent filter. Goes on the lens easily, excellent fit. 
6599 4 Awesome...significantly better than the Polaroid duel charger. I love the USB charging port on the side. 
6600 4 Easy to carry in case and works great. 
6601 4 it is so easy and fast to release the stands. 
6602 4 Works great. compatible with my camera and useful on our long trip 
6603 4 Great for any camera. The legs of the tripod are very flexible and has a good grip. 
6604 4 Works good 
6605 4 Works as advertised. Great product and good buy! 
6606 4 worth the price 
6607 4 I really love all this set up. Thanks. Good timing for delivery. 
6608 4 Technical support agent AR004631 was extremely competent and very professional and helpful-Very patient. 
6609 3 Good 
6610 4 Great product and price. 
6611 4 Takes great photos and love the waterproof feature 
6612 3 My 6D would not fits because it is too bulky. Smaller cameras would. It does protect your gear. 
6613 3 not bad 
6614 3 It was pretty easy to set up. Pictures look great. It has some cool transitions and an option to display multiple pics in a collage format. I was looking for a frame that could be hung on wall and display pictures taken as portraits (vertically), versus landscape (horizontally). 
6615 4 I love this thing. works like a charm- allows for new trigger options on my Fuji 
6616 4 great lens. great photos 
6617 3 It s a good case, but I thought it would be much bigger. 
6618 3 Like the small size and the strap is really nice compared to the on hand strap following the camera 
6619 4 It was just as described and quick service. 
6620 4 I m using Ravelli stands for many years. It s well built stands for all video works I do- holding lights and mics. I m abusing it very hardly and it lasts for me exactly to years, then I buy again and I m very happy with Ravelli stands. 
6621 4 Amazing prime lens! 
6622 4 Burned out the first day of use with my 14 ft LED strip. My fault. I should have got one with higher ampere rating. 
6623 0 It doesn t work. The battery never charges and the light of charge doesn t work. The app doesn t exist!! Sad you sell a not working product 
6624 4 I use this on my Nikon D5200 and it works good. 
6625 4 Good 
6626 4 Exactly what I was looking for at a good price. 
6627 4 Second time purchasing this same setup. The batteries run great just like the original gopro batteries. I have an older set that s already a year old and they re still running like new. 
6628 4 It s nice and small and compatible and easy to make videos 
6629 2 The lens is great, but the tripod fell apart on my first trip and would recommend a new product be included in this package. Great price for everything though, but would ve just bought the lens outright if I could go back. 
6630 3 Emailed them for new parts and they replaced the whole unit. Very easy to work with! 
6631 2 Easy to setup and works great. Picture quality is not as great as I would ve hoped for. 
6632 0 My camera doesn t have a snug place to place it. I am using it because I couldn t wait for another but once I have enough money I will purchase a better one. 
6633 4 Awesome durability, just like genuine. 
6634 4 Great item. Work as described. 
6635 4 Love this case holds all my go pro acc for any trip and sleek and small case as big as a binder 
6636 4 These batteries are good and reasonably priced 
6637 4 I should have gotten one sooner! 
6638 0 Doesn t have enough storage and broke after only a few uses. 
6639 2 Looks bulky but enough room to store camera, charger and extra battery. 
6640 4 Very versatile. Very handy for traveling. Lots of features in a concise light camera. Great lens. 
6641 4 Fast shipping, nice product! 
6642 3 Easy to carry your camera. Anti slip (grip) is working well. 
6643 4 fits, no problems

6649 3 great low/mid level camera , bought as a gift, they love it 
6650 3 Thanks 
6651 4 As advertised, works great 
6652 3 Seems simple to operate -clear picture. Really haven t used it much yet but always like the quality of Samsung 
6653 4 Great image quality with awesome zoom. Lots of features, maybe too many! Would recommend for someone wanting a DSLR (without all the bulk, lenses, cost, etc.) but more than a point-and-shoot. 
6654 4 Not to hard to install 
6655 4 Colourful and functional at the right price 
6656 4 This is an excellent alternative to more expensive action-cameras out there. Good video quality and very easy to use. Waterproof cover appear effective enough for light underwater use, still need to test it. 
6657 4 Worked really well on our trip and paddleboarding! 
6658 3 Point and shoot cameras are a must have for surveying and inspections when on the road and this has lasted a long time. 
6659 4 This is a perfect walk around lens for my Olympus OM-D 5 Mark ii. Can get a little iffy in low light but during the day it is absolutely amazing! 
6660 4 LOVE this camera and super cool --- you can use ALL of the go pro accessories with this as well! 
6661 1 works ok but not very loud i bought it to use inside as a &#34;help&#34; alarm but the chime is not loud enough to be heard will have to get something else 
6662 4 It charges faster than camera base. 
6663 4 I lo ve it 
6664 3 Awesome little camera really helpful and fun. 
6665 4 Great security camera. I love the tilt and pan and really like the talk and listen feature. 
6666 4 A++++++ 
6667 4 Really good adhesive. Feels super secure. 
6668 4 Perfect case for our little Canon powershot effective protection great value. 
6669 4 The best bag I ever had... 2 in 1... 
6670 4 I am the one that loses these lens caps on my camera so I cannot tell you how thrilled I am to have one that stays on! Not only is it so convenient but I won t lose it anymore! Awesome product that arrived in 2 days as guaranteed! 
6671 4 This was a purchase for myself and I have found it as advertised and a good purchase. The seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with. 
6672 4 Great camera easy to work 
6673 4 Worked wonderfully as usual! 
6674 1 waterproof case is good but the suction does not stick 
6675 4 only complaint is when the touch screen waterproof cover is on it will not unlock. Other then that its great 
6676 4 My 15 yo son used it on vacation this summer. The pieces survived horse back riding in the mountains, paddle boarding and kayaking in the river! 
6677 0 Dead on arrival. Not worth the print to advertise it. A peice of junk! 
6678 4 We had an old camera and needed the battery charger and this was perfect for my camera to gift this to my mom 
6679 4 Well made and easy to use product, well worth the money. 
6680 4 Great 50 mm lens! 
6681 4 This is a great lens, works great for details or portraits 
6682 4 On time and exactly what I expected. Excellent job and a magic fiber cloth came with it. 
6683 4 Amazing price. Excellent for Gopro. 
6684 2 Cable a little longer than expected. Otherwise, product is great. 
6685 4 Thanks 
6686 4 Very good quality and very cheap for a rig AND follow focus! It s a perfect size and very easy to use and versatile. It s relatively lightweight but I would suggest ordering a counterbalance as well in addition to it. Would recommend this to any videographer. 
6687 3 looks great on a utility belt, but didn t feel like batman. it receives many filters of varying sizes. decent construction and easy to get stuff in and out of. mounts securely. good thingy. 
6688 4 Works perfect and I don t even notice it doesn t have a nikon logo -why pay more? 
6689 3 Very good quality 
6690 4 great price and reliable. 
6691 4 Does its job! 
6692 4 Nice addition to my macro photography gear. 
6693 4 On a budget? Great! This works perfectly on my canon 6D and the panning is smooth. Height is great for a 6ft good. 
6694 4 Shipping was fast I received it earlier than expected and I m very happy with the camera and accessories! 
6695 0 Outrageously expensive for a camera for which you cannot buy good film - all film for this camera has been discontinued or is expired. 
6696 4 These do a great job clean my glasses and laptop 
6697 4 great price 
6698 4 A great great deal. I saved a lot of money on all these accessories. It came very quickly in time for my vacation. 
6699 4 5 stars for the cost and the fact that it works under water. Needs more mounting options, made it work on my pontoon boat ok, but not on speed boat. 
6700 3 Product arrived as expected 
6701 4 Perfect 
6702 3 Just used it on vacation. Works great. 
6703 0 Did not buy this item 
6704 1 Didn t expect that &#34;Anti-glare&#34; means frosted, I don t like that. And the little one for shoulder screen doesn t fit, it s a bit smaller than the screen. 
6705 3 Good system Beautiful night vision I say BUY 
6706 0 3 days past the 30 days return policy and stopped taking a charge! I would think that an expensive item like this would last more than 30 days guess not! Maybe thats why they only offer 30 days?!?!?!?! 
6707 2 I took this camera to the water park for some reason when it went off it was hard to get it back on I had to take it out of the case and take the battery other than that it took great video 
6708 2 could not get it to work 
6709 0 Item did not specify what it could (or could not ) fit. This does not fit a Nikon D60 so I had to return. 
6710 4 awesome! 
6711 3 Attached it to a 300mm Nikon and works well for my intended purpose (astro-photography, long distance canyonland shots. 
6712 4 It was everything it said it was. easy to install. no problems. 
6713 4 Your 55-200mm needs this! Doesnt fit reversed on my55-200mm dx vr. 
6714 4 Wasn t a perfect fit for my camera, and by that, I mean it was a little loose on the mount, but other than that, it is a really sturdy lens. Very soft picture at f3.5. The camera I am using is a Sony a57 
6715 4 Great Customer Service, Henry , Solved all my connection issues! Foscam excellent camera all features HD and all are included in this Camera. 
6716 4 Product as described, arrived in time 
6717 0 Junk - the screws don t fit through the slots as they show in the photos. Completely useless as shipped. 
6718 4 like it a lot 
6719 2 Sometimes, it s better to save. 
6720 4 Excellent charger. No issues so far. 
6721 4 I use this along with the Joto Universal Waterproof sack for my Samsung Note. Both work great on kayak trips. The bright color is easily visible in case I drop it in the river while shooting photos. I suggest always testing these things in your sink/tub first. 
6722 4 loveit 
6723 3 work great and very reasonably priced 
6724 4 So cute and awesome, loved it! 
6725 4 great case for the price and is made with quality material. 
6726 4 Everything you need to start out with your Instax obsession! This is definitely worth every penny. 
6727 3 Good 
6728 4 Wow!! This really worked and now I can see everything closely and clearly. Great low price!!!! 
6729 0 Sucks 
6730 3 Perfect for table top 3D scanner application with a small projector and camera. 
6731 4 Very incredible flash, in depth for the Nikon d 5500, decent quality piece of equipment for the price 
6732 4 SO awesome! Very nice. My only complaint is that my black pear receiver cuts off some of the information. Not sure if its the mini iOSD or my receiver. Still pleased though! 
6733 4 All of the Datacolor gear we ve tried works GREAT! 
6734 1 The charger seems to work but one of the batteries will not hold a charge any more. This happened after 2 months. I d spend your money on the samsung battery as a spare and not worry about a charger. You can charge the batteries using an external pack anyway. 
6735 3 Up graded my gear and camera and this bag holds it all and then some. Awesome bag. 
6736 4 Everything fine, useful as expected & good delivery service... 
6737 4 Wonderful camera, so happy 
6738 1 It s difficult to turn the camera off or on, or to change the camera card, without taking the camera down from its mounting position, unlike front-loading cameras. i would not buy another one. 
6739 2 Had to return mike because it was faulty, was unable to connect to it. I was going to use it as a baby monitor. I was too afraid to get another one. 
6740 4 Don t waste your money on Nikon or Canon speedlights. Go with these. They get the job done and match and go beyond quality of c and n. 
6741 4 Fits the Canon Sx170 camera perfectly. I would highly recommend this case. Good quality and camera protection. 
6742 4 This is absolutely the cutest little camera! It was exactly what I wanted: old school pictures in a modern little package! I absolutely love it! Everyone that has seen me with it wants one too! 
6743 4 Good 
6744 0 can not loop record and destroy 3 of my SD card 
6745 0 Just received my camera, turned it on and found I was looking through a very grainy viewfinder. Thought maybe I failed to remove a protective sheet, but nope. Been searching the web for answers with no luck. Disappointed! 
6746 4 Perfect fit, easy to use controls. Just be careful not to lose the focus gear! 
6747 4 Kenneth with foscam s support team remote connected into my computer and made the setup effortless. The camera s quality seems pretty good. 
6748 4 right angle viewer works on canon reflex camera..dont have to bend your head so much. 
6749 0 Broke first day! 
6750 4 great product. 
6751 2 Can I just set the cams up without DVR or an computer? Can I just drill them to the walls and turn them on? 
6752 4 great product so surprised that the batteries were charged when I received them. 
6753 4 Awesome 
6754 4 I love it but was at first concerned with the free floating aperture lever. Just seemed a bit chincy that it would bang around like that. Overall I m impressed. 
6755 4 😀 
6756 4 Great product for the price 
6757 3 Great Product for the Price 
6758 4 GOOD sturdy material in useful szes. 
6759 4 Sweet 
6760 4 Works great, easy set-up and great price. plan to buy another in the near future. Highly recommend. 
6761 4 Really like this product nice pictures under water my granddaughter loves to play with it And the playback looks good.would puy again 
6762 1 Tiny bag must be like 4x3x2 
6763 4 The batteries work better then the one the camera came with. 
6764 4 This is just what I needed. It was packed real good, here when you said. Thank You,. Have a nice day. 
6765 4 Perfect way to carry your camera equipment without the camera bag. 
6766 2 Its a good deal but the quality could be better, but then you get what you paid for! 
6767 3 Canon expensive. 
6768 4 awesome little camera. takes great pictures. i use it with the 30mm pancake lens, it makes the camera very portable. 
6769 4 I haven t used this yet, but have tried it with my binoculars and it fits fine. 
6770 4 Works great more distance and clearer 
6771 1 Cool little device but not for me. 
6772 4 A+ 
6773 3 Adequate cable length 
6774 4 great product for the price...light weight and easy to use 
6775 4 Very good. 
6776 4 This cable is five feet long so I can drape over back of desk and leave plugged into the back of PC. Will carry smaller two foot original cable in camera carry bag. 
6777 4 easy to use & diverse tools to use with gopro! 
6778 4 Repeat customer for this brand. The quality and price are great and so far no issues. 
6779 4 Really nice bag for my camera and photo supplies 
6780 1 If you can spend money and buy something better go for 
6781 3 The accessories are great, but the case could be larger or designed better. The case will comfortably hold your camera, a couple batteries, and few small accessories. You can jam everything in there but I wouldn t recommend it. 
6782 4 D-Link case C6724030 Technician ID AR004276 I was provided excellent help from this great customer service expert guided me though install and setup. Able to see the camera in desktop, tablet and IPhone. 
6783 4 Fulfilled my expectations 
6784 4 good 
6785 4 Excellent filter, nice and thin, fit well. 
6786 3 camera works well, but the video output requires proprietary editing software to publish 
6787 4 Excellent, robust and easy to use. Once stretched with clips there were no visible signs of crease in the first photo shoot we did after unpacking the sheet. It comes with a nice cloth case with pull-string tie. I am very happy with this background sheet. 
6788 4 Looks a little different from the one that came with my T3i, but it works just as well. 
6789 1 This case is too small for my camera, so I don t use it. The return shipping fee is almost the same as the price of the case, so I didn t bother to return it. It does look well-made, however. 
6790 4 bought to protect my lens from scratches. does the job. 
6791 0 it does not work for Samsung cameras - not for NX. The NX screen flips up and the hinges are on the upper side. Impossible to mount on those cameras 
6792 3 For the price, this is an awesome little tripod but it can easily tip over with larger cameras so be careful of that! I ve had a few incidents of my camera flopping over but thankfully wasn t damaged 
6793 4 I purchased this so I could recharge more batteries faster. Works great and a much better price than from Canon. 
6794 4 Can t go wrong with Tiffen 
6795 4 This flash is working very well with my Sony a6000. It s a huge step up from the built in flash. The package came with quite a few extras. However, I have really only used the flash so far. Great for the price. 
6796 2 Ordered same day but did not make the delivery on time... Now I m out of film for my vacation. Nothing against the product. Love my Fujifilm..lesson learned from ordering last minute.....BUT IT SAID SAME DAY!! 
6797 4 It is a Pelican case what is there not to like about it! 
6798 3 The price was definitely right for this. It helps while taking photographs in bright sunlight, allowing me to have a bit longer exposure and capture vivid landscapes better than previously. The glass is fairly good quality, I will probably buy a stronger one (0.9, etc) in the future! 
6799 4 My first nice camera and I m very happy with it. I can definitely see the difference in the pics from using a cell phone camera. 
6800 3 It is what it is 
6801 4 Took it to the beach in FL. Sand, salt water ... no problem. Next year it s underwater pictures in Belize ! 
6802 4 GREAT 
6803 4 Great purchase, especially for the price. I wasn t sure what to expect, but works perfect for watching our pets and home while away. 
6804 2 I have issues with the zoom sticking. I have had it in the repair shop three times. I am not sure if anything will fix it. 
6805 4 Pelican = great stuff 
6806 2 Camera takes great pictures. Good weight. Camera needs better gripping to hold the camera. I think the flash should be located in the middle of the camera not at the end. If holding the top of the camera and the flash pops up, my finger is in the way. 
6807 4 Great product. 
6808 4 Great item, with this adaptor I can now use all my GoPro mounts with my new JVC Adixxion Camera 
6809 4 Fits my camera perfectly. good quality! 
6810 4 Works great! 
6811 4 As Promised and on time! 
6812 0 Only connects to their smartphone app, so very limited functionality 
6813 4 great 
6814 4 Product was exactly as described and at a great price and very fast delivery !!! Will be back to this sellers page !!! 
6815 4 Small and works perfect. Very happy with this product. 
6816 1 these are rough, they do the job protecting the stuff but dont think you can use them as lens cleaners too like a real goggle bag does. if they made a 5 pack of smith goggle bags or oakley goggle bags that is what most people are looking for !!!! 
6817 0 Really upset that I only got 6 prints out of each pack when it claimed to have 10 prints per pack! 
6818 4 Love it! 
6819 3 Bought it for our vacation at he beach. Loved it, takes great pics, loved having screens on both sides. Was able to get shots while playing around in the water without worrying about ruining the camera. 
6820 1 My hope was to use this as a baby monitor however the picture and sound won t stay up on any of my apple devices so it is not a good solution for a baby monitor. 
6821 4 At first I thought these were oem go pro batteries, but once I received them I realized they were not. Still a great deal and comparable battery for less than half the price of oem! 
6822 3 Strap a little thin but it works well 
6823 4 Great lasts forever 
6824 4 ETA September 24 I received items August 22. Way earlier then expected! great item! 
6825 4 After setting up two out of three cameras, I was having trouble setting up my final camera. I contacted Randy (AR)004232) and he was able to help me through the set up process. I was very impressed with his knowledge and his ability to help me get the camera connected 
6826 4 AWESOME, works as intended. need to struggle a little to understand how it works though 
6827 4 according to expectations, very good article 
6828 4 Love this stand for my D40 Nikon 
6829 2 Item did not come in original Nikon box, as described. All other items are included as described 
6830 4 Easy to install and get up and running. Package was delivered the evening before I left on vacation. I quickly had it set up and viewable from my android phone and tablet for easy viewing from hundreds of miles away. Added security and peace of mind. 
6831 3 Good 
6832 0 I received a used filter with finger prints on it and multiple chips on the glass, they were needle size tips chips but none the less, I was under the impression that I was getting a new filter. Very disappointed, going to stick to buy my filter from B&H Photo 
6833 4 super nice, I used for my gopro 
6834 4 I m an experienced photographer. These are perfect for most situations - particularly street photography. 
6835 4 What s there to say? It s the product from the manufacturer and does everything it is supposed to. 
6836 2 Was much larger and clumsy to work with than anticipated. Seems to be well built, good quality. I ended up buying a selfie which my teen daughter has now taken ownership of. 
6837 4 i really love it thank you 
6838 3 It fits. Its plastic. It was $2 used. I will not spend $30 on a piece of plastic because it says Canon on it. This does the same thing, just without the expensive logo. 
6839 4 work nicely with the Mini Sony CamAction and the Shoei Helmet. I mount it on the lower left side of the helmet. 
6840 2 didn t fit but the people worked with me and got me the right one.. 
6841 4 It works fine 
6842 4 Great high res camera for an excellent price 
6843 4 Easy to set up. Easy to change settings. Great little camera. 
6844 4 works just as good as the OEM ones for a little cheaper. no problems encounter 
6845 4 A must have if taking your GoPro in water. Works!! 
6846 2 The best 
6847 4 Simply Awesome. Hope they will come up with a auto retractor 
6848 4 Great product. 
6849 4 What can I say? This OEM Canon battery is the gold standard. It is more expensive than aftermarket options but when you need guaranteed performance, this is the battery you want in your camera. It holds a charge when used or stored, and the camera software recognizes it. 
6850 4 Charger works great, charged both our OEM battery and the Kastar battery. And the Kastar battery appears to last as long as or close to as long as our original batter does, so that s great! Thank you Kastar! 
6851 4 Just buy it camera is amazing makes every pic look like a professional photo. 
6852 4 Works great for my camera 
6853 4 Great price! 
6854 3 Works exactly as it is described. Other reviewers stated it really has an intense rubber smell...they are correct and that is why I only gave it four stars. I will be cutting the rubber off. 
6855 4 Terrific for the price. 
6856 4 Works as expected 
6857 4 ok 
6858 4 I am so glad I purchased this, as a graphic designer and photographer I desperately wanted my monitor calibrated. It was easy to use and I was able to calibrate my monitors of two screens. Very happy with this purchase. 
6859 4 great deal and smooth transaction 
6860 4 Perfect 
6861 4 Everything in this works great and I love it! The video quality is also very good and I enjoy my kit a lot. Good price. 
6862 4 Good 
6863 4 Perfect for my needs 
6864 4 Fits my Canon 70D perfect. Nice and durable bag. Would recommend. 
6865 4 Works well and no glitches so far. 
6866 4 I love this camera. I bought this camera because my iPhone doesn t take good video in low light. The camera is amazing. I highly recommend it and it s worth every penny. The 1&#34; sensor makes this camera shine and stand out from all the rest. 
6867 4 Good cables 
6868 1 Not as pictured Missing bag Missing screw Missing filter 
6869 4 GW Security technical support was excellent. I had a small problem and GW responded in couple of days and rectified the issue. Thanks GW the camera is great. 
6870 4 Love this camera! ! 
6871 4 Nice 
6872 4 Works like a charm! Was finally able to clean my laptop screen with out it being left with streaks! 
6873 4 this case is great. the quad fits perfectly with enough space for plenty of batteries and accessories. the only thing is the space for the extra props fits 1 set of 4, maybe 6. 
6874 4 Just what I was looking for. Adjustable intensity of light and a rechargeable battery 
6875 0 Nowhere in the description (or product packaging) does it say that it is ONLY usable with the &#34;Swann&#34; brand receiver. Bought this as an add on to a different brand wireless system, it will not connect. 
6876 4 Great product. Used it on 9 dives our past trip! it is lightweight and very comfortable to wear. 
6877 4 works great, used in the ocean in california 
6878 3 Its like receiving a bag of goodies. The Case is good and accessories are decent, but for the suction cup holder I will stick with the GO Pro Brand. 
6879 4 works as advertised and doesnt leave a ring around your eye. 
6880 4 Great tripod. Versatile and super sturdy, even with a 500mm lens on my Sony a6000. 
6881 4 excellent product, works well and at a great price! Would recommend this product for any photographer in need of a neutral density set. 
6882 0 Do not buy this product, after days trying different things to make it work it will not detect the cameras, its not worth the headache, it does not work, buy something else. 
6883 3 I work at HD & use them to find product numbers on high storage items. Even with my glasses I can t read the high numbers. 
6884 4 I really like this lens hood. It stays out of the way, but works very well and can be reversed easily. It s a great buy! 
6885 0 Lasted a few hours with its first charge, which is fine. But with subswquent charges it only held its charge for about 30 minutes or less before dying. Sucky. 
6886 0 I was not able to use. Even though it was a replacement for Bf808u, the wall unit nor car charger was correct. 
6887 4 excellent filter! 
6888 4 Nicely made and neatly stitched. This is a handy way to hold two batteries. I am using mine for Panasonic batteries for the G3 camera. 
6889 4 I love the camera. It s so much better than any one I have ever had. Great deal. Thanks. 
6890 4 just what i wanted; good visibility and not too heavy to use without stand; 
6891 4 I took this camera to London, Paris, Istanbul, and Doha. It performed wonderfully. It does all of the basics well, and has some nice added features (like a pop up flash.) This is the best camera I ve ever owned in this price range. 
6892 4 does the job! 
6893 4 The camera lens case worked out and fit perfectly. Quality looked good and put together well. The purple band and purple fur interior helps to differentiate between cases. Very satisfied 
6894 0 Broke within minutes. Seller said the faulty part would be replaced, months later, nothing 
6895 0 You can t wear it, inside is the hat there s a hard plastic shell to keep the wiring from you head so the hat doesn t stay on your head. This was a waste of money for me not a good purchase. 
6896 4 I have had this camera for a few years and used it extensively in cold weather shots in Alaska. I like the viewfinder for people pictures or taking shots in too much direct sunlight. The movies are pretty amazing for something you can tuck in the shirt pocket. 
6897 3 OK for me! 
6898 4 Love it! Got one for my husband and my mother. Like the calendar feature that still plays the slide show in the smaller frame. Would definitely recommend - and size is just right for desk - anything bigger would take up too much space. 
6899 4 Recieved, everything ok. Excellent product. 
6900 3 Works as expected, this is the kind of charger Nikon should have included 
6901 4 Excellent quality for the price! Easy to use, durable and good quality. 
6902 4 So much nicer than my 3rd party grips. 
6903 4 Fits Olympus 17mm f/1.8. Works well as replacement for outer edge pinch cap which are difficult to remove or replace especially with a lens hood in place or on smaller diameter lenses. 
6904 2 So I guess I thought this would focus up close with this lens but it is literally just a mirror attached to a clear lens. Kinda not what I thought. Its a little dissapointing 
6905 4 Worked fine and at a MUCH lower price than the Cannon 
6906 4 Great for out budding &#34;scientist&#34;. Decent optics at the lower powers. 
6907 0 I ordered a purple camera and received a white one. I am very disappointed. If it weren t for the fact that returning items was such a hassle, I would return it. If it were possible to give zero stars, I would. 
6908 4 Nice plate to keep on camera without taking much room. 
6909 0 Low quality printing. I d go with another company/ design. 
6910 0 Didn t last long. Broke quickly. Dangit! 
6911 4 Use this every time I pull out my telescope 
6912 4 Great bag! Holds all my equipment and that s a lot!! So many pockets that I sometimes forget where things are. 
6913 4 Upgraded from the old style controller without the gimbal tilt wheel. This is the same controller as the factory controller that was shipped with my first DJI Phantom 2 Vision Plus, however this controller also has the rechargeable battery. For the price, it was well worth the added features. 
6914 4 Utilize this every job I ve had. Excellent quality and great price 
6915 4 Great Product, works as advertised with no issues with broken parts or dead batteries as some have reported. 
6916 4 Fits my new long lens perfectly and is well built. 
6917 4 The battery has worked excellently, and it was delivered very promptly. Having used it in our GoPro for several months, I can say that it has worked exactly how we wanted it to. I highly recommend getting it from SNOW_WAKE_SURF! 
6918 4 Built like a tank. Exceeded my expectations. 
6919 2 Very tight for my Galaxy 6 with the Otter Box case. 
6920 4 Easy to use. Recently used on a trip to Russia from U.S. 
6921 0 These are crap they fall apart wasted my money once again. I am a real paranormal Investigator I no what is crap 
6922 3 The tripod is so cheap I would never trust my camera on it. Other then that everything is great. I love the side hand grip, and have recommended it to anyone who will listen! Great product. 
6923 4 Great condition and cost effective way to give yourself secure piece of mind when away from home. 
6924 0 Although the camera said it was connected over wifi, once I disconnected the wifi cable it would not connect. I repeated for hours, restarting and rebooting every device. 
6925 3 Great for the price but not real good cameras at night 
6926 4 Great item! easily accessible and works great! 
6927 1 You pay for what you get. It has decent quality and video. Mine had a black dot right in the middle of the sun when it was in veiw. Don t let it take shock at all it ll screw it up bad. Mine no longer works properly. 
6928 4 Love how it s softens my flash. Used it for outdoor & indoor shoot. 
6929 1 This camera does not focus good at all, the color seems to be off some, Not true color. and the night vision was super grainy even with some light.. I have several cheaper Zosi cameras and they are much better quality then this one. 
6930 4 Saved my drone thanks so much 👏🏾👍🏽 
6931 3 Nice camera, weird user interface, takes some time to get used to, for the price its a nice camera 
6932 4 Easy to attach. Seems sturdy enough in construction. Given as a gift to a friend who is planning on using it for his hunt coming up. I m looking forward to the pictures. Company was prompt in delivery. Nice box with added accessories.thank you 
6933 4 I have always used the Hoya filters and love the slim frame design. 
6934 3 Comfort s quite disappointing. 
6935 4 Awesome lens. Delivered promptly and the item was as described. Thanks so much!!! 
6936 4 Works perfect, great price at Amazon. 
6937 3 Bought this mostly for the air ball. 
6938 0 They dont do anything, except the fisheye, but it s not even that great. 
6939 4 I have a Sony Cyber-shot. fit my camera exactly. 
6940 4 Not a DSLR but this is a great camera for family reunions just to save the memories. 
6941 4 Product was exactly as described and at a great price and very fast delivery !!! Will be back to this sellers page !!! 
6942 4 very happy now I can play with my camera, I recommend 
6943 2 The item is not worth the price paid. 
6944 4 I absolutely LOVE this lens. It is used all the time and looks phenomenal. I would immediately recommend this to anyone that asked! 
6945 2 The measures are good, and you can move it easy, the materials are well for the price. But the head make noise when you paning or tilt. And the legs loose the high easy. 
6946 4 excellent price, product as advertised, held charges well, highly recommend 
6947 3 It does the job 
6948 4 very good lens 
6949 4 This arrived as promised, with two functional batteries. Great item. 
6950 2 its good 
6951 4 compact, works great and is light. 
6952 4 excellent 
6953 0 Not very impressed with this tape. Looks great on the roll but doesn t stick to anything. I am not sure what this is for... tape that doesn t stick... 
6954 0 Won t stay on! 
6955 3 ... years ago, when I purchased this lens it was the only 300mm option for the GF1 I was using. That aside, I have used it to get some nice, exciting shots of birds that I otherwise would not have. I m very glad I purchased it. 
6956 4 Wonderful units! A must have. 
6957 4 Ok 
6958 4 Good bargain on these batteries. They are hard to find in stores and when I do find them I pay $5 for each one!! 
6959 4 Gotta love that pick n pluck foam ! I ll be ordering for my other cases. 
6960 4 Just started using the camera. Will take time to benefit from all the features. Happy so far. 
6961 3 great 
6962 4 Good light for the money, 
6963 3 A good battery and charger I purchased for the Panasonic ZS15 .Very good in all this great compact camera 
6964 4 Couldn t be happier! What a vendor! 
6965 2 I rate 3 star because the tightness adjust screw can t keep on my set. once its set on tight, and loose after few times rotate monopod. 
6966 1 Don t waste your money. Just buy more battery packs 
6967 2 I love the camera, but very dissatisfied with the battery life of each charge. My previous cannon had a different battery pack a lasted almost twice as long. 
6968 0 It works like few weeks now after few days It was not working. I am not sure its battery or remote control by it self. 
6969 2 I was able to fit an 808 hq30 camera. I have not tested it underwater yet. 
6970 4 good item. a little tight, so I didn t use it yet. 
6971 4 What a bargain~ 
6972 4 It give you the essential s to help anyone take better pictures. In as much if you purchased each item separately it would be pricey worth the price 
6973 4 There are no better cases than Pelican. Hands down. 
6974 4 Works great just as good as my Gitzo 6x but for 2/3 the price 
6975 3 Good for messenger bags; not good for typical backpacks. It s wider than expected, but of reasonable quality. 
6976 4 Install this great add on to system. Great picture 
6977 4 sets itself up easily. sound works on an ipad with the app. for it. 
6978 4 one of a few places where can purchase a great purchase 
6979 4 I really like my Nikon Coolpix camera. Easy to use and light weight. Works great. Love that it s pink! 
6980 4 Bought this camera for my daughter prior to our trip to Maui this summer and it took some fantastic pictures of our underwater snorkeling trip. 
6981 4 Works great 
6982 1 I had to return this item. The built is good, it s also bright but the green spike is a little too much. 
6983 4 The batteries work just like the original batteries I got with the camera, so far I have about 10 recharges and no complains. 
6984 4 Great camera. 
6985 4 Excellent product 
6986 4 Perfect!!! 
6987 4 A good buy, Happy costumer. 
6988 4 Satisfied 
6989 4 look no further! There are no exceptions for this product! 
6990 4 Great cameras for the $. We can see everything. Clarity is awesome too. No blurry spots. 
6991 4 easy to install 
6992 4 Held up in some intense class 3 whitewater on an upside down kayak... Got some cool footage! 
6993 4 Exact fit. 
6994 4 Good 
6995 4 Best, top of the line camera. Love the quiet shutter, its heavier than most, but takes remarkable images!!! I ll never own another camera. 
6996 0 Useless. Faulty design. Returned it. 
6997 4 I ve not used any of them yet. Ordered them for a party. They are cute though. 
6998 4 I bought this as a gift for a family member and they love it. States it is much better than the regular neck strap which gets tiring after a few hours 
6999 4 Nice, portable. I use it with my iPhone 
7000 4 good 
7001 4 Awesome lens. Bright and sharp photos. Loving it so far. 
7002 3 Good 
7003 3 Works very well and consistent after you learn to use it. 
7004 4 Cool!@ 
7005 4 my only grip of the 7000 series is the small body size compared to my D200. This really made a big differece. 
7006 4 5 stars because you can t beat the value for price. It comes with a memory card and I filmed a time lapse first chance I got and loved the results. Using the wifi mode a huge plus. 
7007 4 Good product; well designed. My Phantom 2 Vision seems to fly much better with these props than with other brands. 
7008 4 Awesome product. Works well with waterproof cover in the ocean, on my motorcycle, sports events 
7009 4 I have to say this is super easy installation camera that I highly recommend to any mothers who need to watch their babies. Although it is VGA resolution , it provides me good image quality that I expected. 
7010 3 Battery was well priced and delivered on time. However the camcorder it was going to be installed into no longer works. Never used this product. Thanks anyway Amazon 
7011 4 Easy on and off for storing in the bag and protects the edges of the lens nicely. 
7012 0 It doesn t work! I opened it and the screen won t turn on 
7013 4 Everything was as expected. Product and timely receipt were perfect. 
7014 4 The AmazonBasics Tripod is sturdy and secure. A good choice if looking for a tripod with a GREAT price. Love the hook to hang additional lens on!!! 
7015 4 Takes great close up pics. 
7016 4 Excelente 
7017 4 Worked grest 
7018 4 Extremely practic. Nice 
7019 4 Great Product!!! fast Shipping!! 
7020 3 Very happy with the camera. Its a must to turn it off or the battery will drain. 
7021 4 Product was as advertised. 
7022 3 I didn t really want to add a surveillance device to my security system, but opted for one camera along with motion detectors and sirens. The resolution of this camera is very good but it would warrant five stars if it had a zoom feature and smoother action. 
7023 4 Excellent service! Product as described! 
7024 1 Looked like it was gonna work great. Then an oring broke before first use. Total garbage. 
7025 4 I love this product!!!! 
7026 3 Works as expected... It s definitely an affordable option when considering an action camera. Only down side so far is that the screen is a little flimsy. 
7027 4 Perfect mount for my Olympus Camera 
7028 4 Easy to use; Effective and used for a successful installation. Good price 
7029 4 Well made and fits my nex nicely. 
7030 3 as described 
7031 4 Great battery life. Works great, fits great. 
7032 4 Nice!!! 
7033 4 They are batteries. They fit in my mouse. What else can you say about batteries? 
7034 3 My camera fell off in mid air and smashed to the ground. 
7035 2 Seems to drain quite quickly compared to batteries with similar MAH 
7036 4 Product is exactly as advertised. 
7037 4 Good 
7038 4 Love em. Perfect for pranking however when outdoors and windy they audio can be out of sync with the video to see them in use check out my YouTube channel @ psycokid4ever88 and watch my pranks 
7039 1 Good but i think this have remot for com 
7040 4 Eighty bucks well spent, love this thing, don t know why it took me so long to get away from stupid neck straps. With the Arcatech swift clamp it was a bit pricy, but well worth it. And you won t look like a tourist when using it lol. 
7041 4 Holds 2 Paul C Buff Einstein lights, extension cords, light stands, umbrellas, triggers, and various other items. Now all I have to do is grab one bag and all my gear is in there. 
7042 2 really works for me, especially on the streets of europe. wished it was less expensive though. the rain cover at the base really works. the padding which comes in contact with your back though will suffocate & make your back sweaty 
7043 4 This is small enough that I can take it anywhere in my camera bag. I love how adjustable the legs are. This was not an expensive tripod, but it s actually pretty sturdy and really comes in handy! 
7044 4 Exactly what I needed! 
7045 2 Difficult to operate. The toggle area is very small and hard to manipulate. Wouldn t buy again. 
7046 4 I love it take nice clear picture and you can zoom in and all so fits in your pocket. its great!!! 
7047 4 Super! 
7048 3 Works great, however sometimes the onboard controls seem to take priority to the camera controls. When this happens it is quickly resolved by switching the on/off switch on the battery grip on/off. Definitely not a deal breaker for me, but would be nice if this didn t happen. 
7049 4 Thank you! 
7050 4 waterproof, dustproof and shockproof?the best camera in the history of human race. quite pricey but the quality of this device is really great. 
7051 1 was not all there len cap missing got 3 lens and the case hat all no len cover cap bad......[[ASIN:B003QQYFLA Bower VFK46C 5-Piece 46mm Digital Filter Kit]] 
7052 0 I wouldn t recommend. It definitely doesn t work for what I want. Limited focus. You truly get what you pay for. 
7053 4 Works great, got this for Canon G16 so I don t have to wear it around my neck, I can just slip it in my pocket. 
7054 4 I ve been using this camera for 5 weeks and am totally pleased. The seller shipped it fast and sold it at a good price, just as advertised. Most of my pictures are of wildlife, especially birds, and I highly recommend it among cameras in its class. 
7055 2 Very Good 
7056 4 This is just what I needed for my camera! 
7057 4 Thanks so mush I like it 
7058 4 Nice quality product. Excellent price! Delivered on time. 
7059 4 great 
7060 3 Worked just fine. Interesting video shot from unique perspective. Do you have enough ideas for video to make it worthwhile. 
7061 4 Works! 
7062 4 So far so good. I needed camera with zoom plus ability to make pictures while shooting video. It kinda on a slow side to start, has bunch of futures for young people, manual on short side but you can find it on computer. 
7063 4 The Canon EOS REbel T5i camera is an excellent addition to the field of photography...easy to use with professional results. 
7064 4 My six-year-old grandson seemed to like it! But, he did not provide a detailed report. 
7065 2 3 1/2 some pieces are hard to fit 
7066 0 I could not get it to work 10 days after receive it! 
7067 3 Very nice! 
7068 4 Been using this product so far so good. 
7069 4 This tripod is great!! Its very affordable and easy to set up!! I love the fact that I can use it to film with my iPhone 6!! 
7070 0 IT WAS THE WRONG CHARGER 
7071 3 I like it 
7072 4 works perfectly. 
7073 3 Does what it say. 
7074 2 hard to find additional quick release plate mounts :( all the plate mounts that do fit come from overseas and takes mount or more to arrive 
7075 0 Quality is cheap 
7076 4 Was very happy with this! 
7077 3 Easy to set up and operate. I operate from both the browser website and the Android app. Have set up in two different houses. Seems like good Wi-Fi range. Comes with nice, flat patch cable to hardwire into router for setup. 
7078 4 Fast shipping works well 
7079 4 Much sturdier than I expected. Holds flashes, umbrellas, video lights. Appreciate the ability to change angles of whatever is being held. Plan on ordering a few more. 
7080 3 Fast shipping. Vid is grainy at times but for the price it is very a very good cam. 
7081 3 Wonderful product for the price. I attached it to a 18mm lens and got some dramatic shots like the one attached to this review. Mind though, that they are a little heavy and bulky, so your zoom lens will look like a tele and weight as much. 
7082 4 Awesome package deal , everything was as described will do business again 
7083 4 It gets the job done, especially if you are on a budget. 
7084 3 love the zoom feature for a compact camera. 
7085 1 Doesn t hold a charge for longer than three weeks. 
7086 4 Very cool product! I have it on my camera, and it is nice to know that I will have plenty of juice for all of my shoots. 
7087 1 Bought 2 and both are coming apart at the seam. Good when they work, though... 
7088 3 Works as advertised 
7089 4 Awesome product, awesome pictures. 
7090 4 The best! 
7091 2 works good but under articulation you can crack the joints rendering it useless 
7092 4 It works good... 
7093 4 Works perfectly and love that it comes with extra batteries! 
7094 4 All good! 
7095 3 Works great, looks great. Battery life is decent. Can t see anything in the dark 
7096 4 Exactly what I was looking for 
7097 2 I have the older style: single position bulb for 60X and slide out 8X. The 8x is useless, but the 30X has very sharp magnification and the focus wheel is very helpful. An annoying aspect is that it has a backward reversed image. 
7098 4 rain proof it is working for my ip camera. 
7099 2 It does it job, rubber caps are ok, back and side doors quality feels low but you definitely get what you pay for. 
7100 2 Acceptable quality for the cost, but have reasonable expectations on visual quality. 
7101 4 Loved this and worked exactly like I needed it to. Simple and easy. 
7102 0 I received this camera on time; but when I looked at the package, it said to develop it by April 2010. It is at least 5 years out of date. I am returning it. 
7103 4 Loving it! If you re looking into buying one of these, you probably shouldn t be looking at Amazon review. Very complex. 
7104 4 working as advertized 
7105 4 Nice new camera. Very useful for taking pictures all around. Arrived on time. Thank you. 
7106 4 You can count on Lowepro to deliver quality products and I love this bag. It carries all my camera gear with ease and is not too bulky or heavy. I purchased the bag in the green color and have received compliments and &#34;where did you get that?&#34; questions. 
7107 4 Love it!!! 
7108 4 Recommended! 
7109 4 great 
7110 4 Very happy with this product - it s inexpensive and works great! 
7111 4 Excellent seller and product. A must have for anyone who shoots photos with a DSLR camera. 
7112 3 Came with the printer, paper works fine and prints fine. I wish there was a local source so I could get replacements quicker when I need them 
7113 3 works well and very affordable 
7114 4 Amazing! Does exactly what you need. Built like a tank and very sturdy. Must have for any serious photographer. 
7115 4 Very nice case. I cut out the foam to fit around my drone. Keeps it nice and secure 
7116 0 It did not work. I changed battery and it was still dead! Very cheap feel too. I cannot find any reliable looking remote control for the Nikon N1 VR3. 
7117 1 Th sound don´t fuction. 
7118 4 Perfect size for Panasonic Lumix. 
7119 4 Works as expected. Pretty long lasting, but mine is brand new, so we ll see how it goes. 
7120 4 Excellent accessory for the Go Pro. Allows hands free use. You won t worry about dropping during entry/exits on your dives. Go Pro cameras has now become the number one object divers find on the bottom, replacing knives and weights! 
7121 4 Great little camera for me. Easy to use and takes good pictures. 
7122 4 SUPER PRODUCTO 
7123 4 Worked as designed. Solid build. 
7124 4 I was really happy with these stickers. They came promptly and they were just as expected. I like all of the designs. 
7125 4 Love it! Works great and fast shipping! 
7126 4 This is the best bag for cables. 
7127 4 It s a wonderful camera with almost everything one need to learn the art of photography. I strongly recommend it. 
7128 4 Excellent Quality. Stylish mat black structure. This product exceeds my needs for my photography skill level. It is not the lightest one on the market, but works for me. 
7129 3 I love this as it is very light weight to carry, but with you camera on it, it is kind of unsafe...make sure you have your camera strap around your next just in case it tips over. 
7130 3 Handy and easy 
7131 2 I guess as long as you get a smatree pole you should be alright. Was hoping there was a kind of &#34;standard size&#34; pole. There isn t. It didn t fit my pole 
7132 3 Careful they dont sent you a 16.1 MP and pass it off as the 20.1 MP....after this happened I complained and got 10$ refunded and kept the camera. The camera is very nice for the $. Point and shoot. 
7133 4 best of the best 
7134 4 Do yourself a favor, if your looking for batteries and accessories for GoPro, buy original GoPro 
7135 4 I have been happy with the product for the last year. 
7136 4 Great product - Easy to use and protects camera from the elements. 
7137 4 It s amazing. Very easy to us. I can tell you, buy it! Thanks Neewer and Amazon! 
7138 4 Excellent 
7139 4 easy to use, sharp, clear vision through the lens 
7140 4 Takes very good pictures, easy to use, great zoom!!!! 
7141 0 Generic lens failure reported on google search. Returned. 
7142 3 Very good. 
7143 0 I am very unhappy with this product as we have been unable to connect it to the internet and numerous calls to the company s tech support have only resulted in frustration. It is a huge waste of money since it can t be set up. 
7144 4 Exactly what we needed 
7145 4 everything was ok. the camera is amazing and the kit is good too 
7146 3 This does NOT come with the mount, you will need to buy a mount that can fit your flash and also mounts to a bowens mount 
7147 4 Beautiful bag, enough room for my camera body and a couple of lenses. The padded insert comes out so I can use it for a handbag. 
7148 4 Great protector of your main lens and adds to clarity of photo. 
7149 4 Fits everything that I use for my GoPro Hero perfectly. Have had no problems with the case, very durable and compact. 
7150 4 Nice filter. Thin, light weight.haven t had it out on a shoot yet. Super fast shipping, well packaged. Thank you. 
7151 4 Fit for purpose. 
7152 4 And it works, well. 
7153 4 For the price you can t complain! They are nicely built and give you clear image even there magnification is so high! You need stable hands or tripod otherwise things look shaky because of 20x. Recommended for night viewing and wild life. 
7154 4 Good 
7155 4 It s great thanks 
7156 4 Looking forward to using this. The toting bag is nice. Quick to set up, light weight. 
7157 4 Arrived on time and a better value then purchasing locally. 
7158 4 Great Product! I will buy it again. 
7159 4 NO COMMENT 
7160 4 Just as described--and just what I needed--with perfect shipping! Thanks so much! 
7161 4 a nice improvement. 
7162 4 Really easy to use and has a great range. We actually have family pictures from our recent vacation with ALL of us in the photos! 
7163 4 Almost too bright. I had to pull it back farther from the window to make it look like our TV looks normally. Nice, random lights like the TV. 
7164 4 seems pretty durable and the hotshoe fits very sung... maybe even a little to snug but at least I know it won t fall out 
7165 4 Came in handy with my water camera. Best purchase!! 
7166 4 Love this lense. I currently use it with the a x1 I was able to photograph the moon with it and it came out very good. 
7167 3 great, just rec d and have not used. But have never had problem with other tapes before 
7168 4 Excellent! 
7169 4 Love the Polaroid Zip ... and the paper you have to get prints out dry. 
7170 3 Great product 
7171 4 This is a really fantastic camera! Go to DxOMark dot com and read more about it: they say the D810 is not really much of an improvement as far as picture quality and sharpness goes. The photos are fantastic. Read all the other reviews. 
7172 4 Perfect fit. I love it. 
7173 4 worked great 
7174 4 So far so good. Surprised they came fully charged and ready to go. 
7175 4 it go s 150 feet or 50 meter and more 
7176 3 The unit is sturdy--I am still playing around with different configurations 
7177 0 over priced 
7178 0 The binoculars had a very strong noxious odor from the rubberized coating. 
7179 2 No holes in side. I knew this might be the case based on other review, but for $15 I can drill some holes in it. Still cheaper then name brand gopro skeleton housing. 
7180 2 Photos show beautifully. Music does not work and instruction manual does not explain how to correct it. 
7181 4 Great price and quality of product. Thank you 
7182 1 The product doesn t like brand new as the inner filter box was quite dirty and there is a dent on filter can t be cleaned off. I am in oversea so can t return it, not a good experience this time 
7183 4 Great filter set with compact carrying pouch. 
7184 4 Works well. My teenage daughter is going to town. Easily pairs up with iPhone 5C, and appears to be well made. 
7185 4 Excellent transaction - no issues 
7186 0 It was broken when I opened the box! 
7187 4 Great bag, Roomie and would trust that it will withstand a fall. Was impressed by the color, durability of the pockets and it s organized design. Would support this company as their customer service is helpful :) 
7188 3 I think it was a little too expensive, but it does work well. 
7189 4 It works great 
7190 4 excellent camera, great photos and very durable. Arrived much earlier than expected - great all around! 
7191 3 Takes good photo s and video is decent,battery life is not good drains to fast must carry extra batteries. 
7192 4 Yes I decided to keep the Meike Battery Grip can you email me A reasonable price for Battery s for the Battery Grip for Canon 70 D thank you for your business 
7193 0 this is my second buy and came with several problems Not save the changes in configuration every time you turn off the car and start again reset the value to factory reset. so it s a good item but can t be sure if came or not with problems 
7194 3 Just what was needed. Thank you. 
7195 4 I was extremely pleased with the quality of photos and video from this camera, both above and below the water. I would definitely recommend it. 
7196 3 Prompt delivery and it works like promised. Thanks 
7197 4 The camera works beautifully. The night vision, and the fact we can check the app from anywhere is really cool! 
7198 4 O.O So many buttons. I ll figure it out though. It seems to be a great deal so far! 
7199 3 Works well. No instructions. 
7200 3 I have EXTREMELY small wrists, so it can still wiggle around a bit even tightened down on me. However, it s still super useful for many situations and being adjustable, I ve been able to let others use it when filming with my gopro. Glad I purchased. 
7201 4 Great camera!!! I have had several cameras and this is my favorite by far! 
7202 3 Had some glitches with the ejector for the film but it is overall a really good camera for the price. 
7203 4 Good product. 
7204 4 Does a wonderful job removing the &#34;dust&#34; particles - easy to carry and ready at all times. Every photographer should have one packed. Visit the truetoad site for reviews... 
7205 2 the tool doesn t fit 
7206 4 great 
7207 0 camera was a gift 
7208 3 The binoculars worked great. Took my granddaughters to a One Direction concert and our seats were in a higher section but with the Olympus we could see every eye color, smile and dance that the band performed. 
7209 4 Quick delivery. Everything was as portrayed. 
7210 4 Fits well. 
7211 4 Lovin these clips, waiting for the AA to be released 
7212 4 worked great for my camera, bought it a couple years ago and its still working great! 
7213 4 This is a great hand held telescope 
7214 4 Inlived ur product but i expected to have instax mini film included 
7215 4 good item 
7216 3 it s normal 
7217 3 Great. Very easy setup 
7218 4 It is good. It is a battery. What can I say? It charged up, it works. 
7219 4 All products came as advertised and work really well. No issues at all. The selfie stick does have a bit of a balancing issue since you cant lock it into a certain position but as long as you are not swinging it around like crazy it will stay upright. 
7220 4 The set is everything Inwas expecting. Shipping was quick! 
7221 2 Pretty good lights. Except that I don t like that the bulbs stick out past the &#34;cone&#34;. The lights have dropped to the floor and it breaks the bulb. That s annoying. 
7222 4 Loved this bag, looks nice feels well made and there are many bucket in it. 
7223 2 It was nicely made but soon came off the camera I had put it on. It was an experiment that failed. 
7224 4 I have been using the battery ever since I bought it and it works great. No issues at all and I would buy another one if I needed it 
7225 4 good to have on hand and works well for my needs. Thanks!! 
7226 4 good~~ 
7227 4 Awesome camera deal!! Camera is everything and more than I expected great buy in my opinion. 
7228 4 Excellent on all counts!! 
7229 4 I was very much satisfied with this product and received exactly what I ordered! 
7230 4 Met my expectations and all the extra stuff was great. 
7231 4 it is really good. Do not hesitate to buy it. I am totally satisfied with my purchase 
7232 4 Excellent bundle package. 
7233 4 Cant live without this case. 
7234 4 Package arrived on time and in good condition. Soft box was was easy to put together and held up well. Does a nice job with a speedlight 
7235 0 Too small for the A6000 when a lens is attached thereto. 
7236 4 Love the size of this camera. The video is not the greatest but for what you are spending it is nice. The water proof case is a nice addition. I took it on a rafting trip, no leaks. Nice combination. Very pleased with this set up thus far. 
7237 4 Great 
7238 4 Excellent product and seller. 
7239 4 It quickly charges my GoPro batteries without having to use the camera. The car charger is perfect for road trips. 
7240 0 Didn t fit my X100LE , way to tight , damaged the hotshoe upon removal ... I would give it 0 stars if I could 
7241 4 Excellent deal. Product just as described. 
7242 4 Nice item works great 
7243 4 The service reps stick with you to figure out how to fix. And they are very knowledgeable. Awesome! 
7244 4 Great item, my camera fits and I can carry an extra battery. 
7245 4 Excellent quality! 
7246 4 Excellent product, using with a Logitech c920 webcam. Sturdy construction, had the ability to lock at the perfect angle. 
7247 4 Small, simple, well made, and looks great! An indicator light for each battery shows when it s sufficiently charged, which is about all the info I need. 
7248 4 Just what I wanted and work great 
7249 4 Works great and I love the camera 
7250 4 Good 
7251 2 Cheap, but functional. The threaded ring came too easily out of the rubber piece. Collapses well, but I don t expect it to last too long without the rubber cracking. 
7252 4 Excellent buy. Good quality for the price. Bought two. One for my wife and one for myself. Beats sharing and having to constantly refocus. 
7253 4 great 
7254 4 Optically perfect but heavy. 
7255 4 Very nice case arrived in great condition. 
7256 4 I use this brush for scanning photos. It helps minimize dust between each scan. Does what it s suppose to. 
7257 4 Super, super! 
7258 4 Great stand! 
7259 0 Although claimed it does not work with D750????? 
7260 3 great for the price 
7261 3 Good Case 
7262 4 Really happy with the teleconverter and the results I am getting. The conversion of my nice nikon 1.8 50 mm into a 100 mm walk around lens AWESOME!!! 
7263 2 As advertised. 
7264 1 This Tripod is very wobbly. I put my camera on it and the legs bend extremely easy. I cannot recommend this product. it is cheaply made with cheap materials. I dont trust my camera with this Tripod 
7265 3 Arrived in great shape. Although it s a very basic lens it was exactly what was needed for the project. 
7266 0 returned... was not in shape stated. cat hair all over it...nothing worked properly. 
7267 4 The battery was of very good quality. Price was also excellent. 
7268 4 works as advertized 
7269 4 Hubby is sooooo happy with it. He;s still learning lots and enjoying it all. 
7270 4 Works well. I had bought one of these years ago for $50, and this one is just the same. When I ride by the house it looks occupied. 
7271 4 Great price for the kit. The flash itself is a work horse.. Doesn t over heat like bigger ones if you need to be able to shoot rapidly. 
7272 2 The set up is super difficult. If you can get past that, it is a good camera. I still haven t figured out how to record…I can only watch live 
7273 4 A great gift for an 80th birthday...She can now have her family with her always in the pictures of their lives which were downloaded for her! Easy to use! AMAZON DELIVERY WAS AMAZING...ON TIME AS PROMISED! 
7274 4 Great value for the price! Its a good combination of lenses/filters. The threads fit perfectly with the camera lens. Quality of the material used is also very good. 100% happy with the purchase! 
7275 4 GREAT service and prompt delivery. Unfortunately, the glasses were too big for my head but a friend took them and absolutely loves them! 
7276 1 Set up is pain I had D link cameras too and it didn t require port forwarding, and all other critical set up activities. It was just plug n play. Returning product and getting Dlink again. 
7277 4 Works fantastic with my 70d. Feels solid, button feedback is crisp and clicks not rubbery. There s a distinct off, half way and full press on the shutter. And the batteries fit perfectly and work perfectly. 
7278 4 Love this camera 
7279 4 Liked the selfie stick it was better than what i thought .. 
7280 4 GREAT 
7281 1 Seems to be poor quality - I don t really trust it. 
7282 4 Awesome speaker, tough as can b And rather loud to, great for my PA system and air horn 
7283 4 This purchase went exactly as planned. Order, receipt, and function were all what I expected. Good job!! 
7284 4 Great product and exactly what I wanted! Works amazingly well! I was amazed at how well it helps remove reflections and also darkens the leaves of trees by cutting down their shine. Very happy with this filter! 
7285 4 Perfect. Just like the waterproof case, except with cutouts for plug ins. Works great, especially when driving long distances. Allows charging cable for the GoPro 
7286 4 VERY HANDY AND PRACTICAL,ALSO VERY CONVINIENT. I RECOMENDED. 
7287 4 perfect fit 
7288 4 A great wrist strap! 
7289 4 excelente 
7290 4 I also have a Go Pro 3 Black and found that the menu system sucked, the battery died way way to fast. The drift while larger has outstanding battery life and is very very easy to use. The remote is also way better than the go pro. 
7291 4 I like it very much 
7292 4 Great camera. Pictures are amazing and very easy to use 
7293 4 Works great. 
7294 4 Great Product for the price! 
7295 4 take some good pic night and day. 
7296 2 Worked ok 
7297 4 Purchased this watch for my 13 year old son and he loves it. Great price and much to my surprise great quality. This watch has held up to a 13 year old boy s abuse and keeps on going. Looks good too! 
7298 4 Great camera, with terrific picture. The new Nest app is easy to use and set up. 
7299 3 Excellent device! I would give it 5 stars but it is a pain to have to remove 4 screws just to change the batteries. 
7300 4 Was what I was looking for. 
7301 4 My teacher recommended the 13x19 portfolio, but I find it s just too big. So I had to buy a new one that s smaller but this one still was great quality. 
7302 0 The strap for the arm got broken 
7303 2 Missing pieces. No batteries, no lens cover. Did not know the item was refurbished. Very disappointed. 
7304 4 This is a great deal. The pictures are beatiful 
7305 4 Perfect, guaranteed, durable product. Amazingly fast shipping and superb customer service. 100% recommend. 
7306 4 Worked OK. 
7307 1 LED lighsts only works with with battery packs and not batteries. The lights were smaller than expected. 
7308 4 LOVE this camera. Definitely a much-used addition to my camera &#34;arsenal.&#34; 
7309 4 This is exactly what I needed and was much more affordable priced than from Canon! 
7310 4 I have used this film ever since I got my instamax mini and I have never had any problems. Every role I ve used has produced quality pictures. I haven t had the problem of getting a role that just keeps printing out white pictures. 
7311 3 had to play with it a bit to get it to work the way I expected to but the video is great and I use it now with no issue. 
7312 4 I took this camera on a road trip, and let me tell you, It produced great videos of my trip across the United States. 
7313 4 Shipped right on time! Amazing product. Bought this set for my trip All the components are great quality. 
7314 3 Bought some flashes that didn t fit my hot shoe, this works perfectly. 
7315 3 This was the same type of a battery I had once before. Worked as expectedly. 
7316 3 Good 
7317 4 Greatest purchase! I use the pole for taking photos while sailing and you can get some really awesome shots! The pole allows you to get take pictures from angles that are impossible otherwise. So glad I bought this! Very cool item! Well made, very sturdy and secure. 
7318 4 Great stands!! I love them!! 
7319 3 very good product 
7320 4 Great filter, love the performance and it just feels high quality. Great buy! 
7321 2 Worked as advertised. Did get water droplets on the filter during the dive that were not visible till watching the video. Then again, the gopro was mask mounted, so got lots of bubbles. Dove to 90 feet, visibility was great, colors were accurate at depth. 
7322 4 All metal parts...high quality and it has lasted several years. Just bought another one because I was so pleased with the previous one. Don t waste your money on the cheaper ball head camera mounts. This one is the best. 
7323 0 no power cord! 
7324 4 Great Product 
7325 4 Very good 
7326 4 Good unit, decent recording ability, for $20, it s hard to lose. 
7327 4 Fits - timely delivery 
7328 1 Probably works great for small action recorders, but will not work with a dslr as they are just too heavy for the timer to be able to keep its balance while spinning. 
7329 4 everything works as advertised, very pleased, just ordered a second one. 
7330 4 It was my sister present! So great!!! 
7331 4 packed great, as advertised. 
7332 2 They work well once you get the right angle, but I think they could use a bit more eye relief than the twist-up eye caps offer. I sometimes find it difficult to acquire a view unless I play with the angle. 
7333 4 Very nice 
7334 4 works nicely and protects my screen well. does not affect my recording or images, clear right through. Thanks! 
7335 4 8&#62; Thank You $$$ 8&#62; :D ^^ 
7336 1 built like crap 
7337 1 Your device will slip out of the Phantom 3 tablet holder using this shield. Not a good fit. 
7338 4 Very simple but built well. No complaints and very pleased. 
7339 4 Easy to install & works well 
7340 0 Sucks, doesn t charge all 3 the same. POS!!!! 
7341 4 great 
7342 4 Awesome! 
7343 4 my family was heart broken at the loss we suffered my daughter wears this every day thank you 
7344 4 I use them to clean my glasses, they work great. Fast shipping. 
7345 4 Works just fine. 
7346 4 Works just as described! This is very moveable mount that works well. I d definitely recommend......note I haven t used this mount for more than 2 weeks but so far, so good. 
7347 4 I bought this to go with a large kit that included a camera, some lenses and filters but didn t include this item. This item worked well, was shipped quickly and was a great price, thanks a bunch, will buy again! 
7348 4 Great clarity and quality for the price. The app was updated, very disappointed. Its slow, sometimes it will just spool with no picture and i never had a problem with the the motion alert with the older app, now with the Vimtag it crashes! 
7349 4 Great value! 
7350 4 Works well when I need to use it on a frame. 
7351 4 Great package for the price. 
7352 0 It sucks 
7353 4 Wasabi batteries have been excellent. I ve used them in two other cameras and a camcorder. They communicate with the camera, have more capacity than the oem battery and I ve never had one die. 
7354 3 Remote works great and very helpful in my learning how to use my camera 
7355 4 Great product. Thanks for good business. 
7356 4 LOVE LOVE LOVE IT... CAME SUPER QUICK.....GREAT QUALITY BEST PRICE 
7357 4 Bought this for my grandson and does many great video now, he loves it , hes 16.... 
7358 4 Works well for the most part ... Wireless is a huge plus ... Takes a little tweaking but is pretty straight forward ... I added a 3rd camera and most likely will buy 2 more for the outside ... 
7359 4 Gives a good picture quality, housing seems rugged enough for the price. happy with this unit. 
7360 4 Worked well during my wife s European trip. Simple and functional. 
7361 4 Pelican, as always, a great product. Have several in use for the last 10 years and still working great. 
7362 4 Really like it. It holds a lot and the sections inside can be moved around to suit your needs. The adjustable straps are nice so whoever is carrying it can fit it to them. Don t miss my clunky camera bag one bit! 
7363 4 works great, i should have bought more, and probably will buy more in the future! 
7364 3 good mic for the low price 
7365 3 everithing OK 
7366 4 This package is legit. Buy it. 
7367 1 The float stick works well but after using it on vacation it already has water in it that won t come out. The extension stick is crappy, it s hard to extend. 
7368 4 No issues with it, highly recommend and a high quality product. 
7369 4 You need it, that s it. Best bang for the buck. 
7370 4 It s very nice!!!! i like all. 
7371 4 Great item and great seller 
7372 1 It is too bulky- when it is closed it s also too large still. 
7373 4 It seem very well made but I haven t use it at a live gig yet so I will report back if I have any problems. It has lot of hoops to hang accessories. So far I could not find any negatives. 
7374 4 Great units. Hi speed sync is fun. 
7375 0 DOES NOT FIT CHARGER ARE YOU SURE IT FITS Nikon D70S Is the S model different from d70 Batteries edges more square. I am going to return battery 
7376 4 I feel like I stole this item for what I paid. It works perfectly! 
7377 4 I am very pleased with my experience in making this purchase. Everything was as promised and was delivered very quickly. I would recommend this company based on my interaction. 
7378 4 It s a great camera bag! 
7379 4 Works! 
7380 4 Good saller 
7381 4 I have so many of these packs. They may not last as long as the Sony batteries, but my A7s it pretty power hungry so it s hard to tell. For the price, it s nice to have extra batteries in my kit. 
7382 4 The adapters worked as expected. Very inexpensive as well. 
7383 4 I Liked the camera and bundle so much, this was the second one I got for a family member! 
7384 4 I don t have to worry about losing the lense cap every again! 
7385 4 Great add on for my Cannon camera. No more running back to the camera for group shots. Works like a charm. 
7386 3 Very good product to my GoPro. 
7387 3 a little bit on the heavy side but sturdy enough to do the job and lighter than a tripod 
7388 0 These batteries physically fit the camera, but unfortunately did not work. 
7389 4 It is a great product. I felt a little hard to rotate the zoom, at the lens. 
7390 4 Got gere on time and works great with the camera 
7391 4 great camera delivered as promised 
7392 4 Simple to use. Clear picture. Fast shipping. 
7393 0 works initially but as time goes on the bubble starts to appear & it doesnt stick anymore 
7394 4 Great buy, especially for those that need the power and an almost universal flash. Pack has been going strong since purchased in 2007. I would highly recommend. Use a cheap shroud or soft cap for alternate effects. 
7395 4 They are realy good. Easy to install, and work perfect. 
7396 4 Fits perfectly. Looks great. Easy to use and great quality 
7397 2 It does what is should, but it is not a huge angle widening. I used it on my 50mm lens and it turned it into maybe a 45mm? The biggest downside is that you lose a bit of focus control since now you have an extra lens to distort through. 
7398 1 Overpriced for a piece of plastic, but it works as advertised. (It looks big, bulky, and silly when attached to the flash unit) 
7399 4 Great value and nice variety of useful items. Recommended!! 
7400 1 Didn t work for me. 
7401 4 Sensor works well inexpensive way to secure a room 
7402 3 Works Great!! 
7403 4 excellent product quality 
7404 4 Better than expected, I ve had it awhile now and it s still performing. Battery life could be better - but that s on nearly all speedlights. 
7405 1 The last flash that I bought is not properly shut continue on after turning it off , and the other does not work correctly the locking when mounted on the camera. 
7406 4 Terry Morgan provides the best tech support. Fantastic cam for the $$!!! 
7407 3 Advice for new parents, your iphone will need to be on ALL the time if you want to keep a constant watch. Otherwise, it s got a really clear picture even in the darkest of situations. Super easy set up. 
7408 2 Good 
7409 3 so far its doing great 
7410 4 This was a gift to my husband for his birthday. It is everything we had expected! 
7411 4 Very Good 
7412 1 I purchased this product. It came with NO instructions whatsoever. Can someone provide me with English instructions? 
7413 4 Great package 
7414 2 cool camera, impossible software. I spent like 3 hours trying to get it setup on WiFi and could not figure it out, even with the special support files provided by hoo too. not recommended for quick install. 
7415 1 Likely sufficient is shooting photos from the sidelines or traveling by car but for the hiker, too heavy, too bulky and too cumbersome. 
7416 3 Works fine. 
7417 4 Great chest harness, well worth the money. 
7418 4 Excellent 
7419 4 Great again and again!! 
7420 0 I got this to record my daughter s graduation. The picture is horribly grainy. I would note commend this camcorder at all. 
7421 4 Great Quality - we recommend this item! 
7422 4 There big and the made the cameras float and the price was good. 
7423 3 So far so good, Camera is sharp enough for close range, IR works great at night. My only beef that kept it at 4 stars is it being a tad slow when you pan around. Other than that its great. 
7424 4 Great already have couple of others. 
7425 0 it worked until iOS 8.4. now I have a useless camera. 
7426 4 batteries came fully charged and lasted a good amount before i had to recharge 
7427 4 Being a larger than average photographer, I was having a hard time finding a long enough strap so my camera would hang comfortably. This is exactly what I needed! Delivery was super-quick! 
7428 4 This harness is so awesome I cant tell you how awesome. I am still finding way that this makes my whole photography life easier. Get you one! Even with one camera it sits fine on my shoulders. 
7429 4 good 
7430 4 Should have purchased these instad of the X1 brand. Works great 
7431 4 works great with amcrest system 
7432 4 Good product. 
7433 1 The camera was in a very good condition. Just I didn t get then what &#34;body only&#34; mean, and buying a lense now is another $150 and also an SD card. So I might as well buy a new camera in that price. Thank you again. 
7434 4 Worked perfectly, no problems. Very good buy. 
7435 3 I really like it, shipping wasnt bad either 
7436 3 Works great and I like it, but it was a little expensive. Also had to pay extra for the articulating mounting arm (which I also like and thought was overpriced). 
7437 0 extremely cheap product. 
7438 0 Its very weak plastic. Broke when i was puting it for first time. Doesnt deserve any star 
7439 4 🙈👆🏻😍 
7440 4 Fits perfectly on my cannon rebel 3ti 
7441 1 Very cheaply made. 
7442 0 I can t figure out how the use it 
7443 4 FUJIFILM s best instant camera as of this date. 
7444 4 There is no second for this case, it is so far out front of any similar case for your expensive camera and or 1911 .45 Remington semi automatic pistol and several magazines. Again, there is no second for the quality of this case. RG 
7445 3 Good optics and works well with my DSLR. 
7446 4 Amazing amount of gear and really functional as well. 
7447 2 I m a cheap butt, and this gizmo got me the shots that I wanted.... 
7448 4 es como se esperaba. 
7449 2 Good 
7450 4 its so cool, the USB interface makes viewing them so easy 
7451 4 Excellent companion to body case. Very high quality 
7452 3 I was expecting the entire picture not just the backdrop. Probably will return. 
7453 4 Everything was as promised. Thanks! 
7454 2 Remote doesn t work. HDMI-out doesn t work. No instructions on how to view/setup online(the &#34;instructions&#34; for DDNS are incredibly vague and not helpful at all). Other than that, pleasantly surprised at the quality of picture and that the HDD was included with the DVR unit for under $200. 
7455 4 Arrived on Time! Great, clean NEW condition with everything in box. 
7456 3 performed as advertized 
7457 4 Awesome purchase especially for the price. Fits my camera perfect with a few accessories as well. 
7458 4 Great Product!!! fast Shipping!! 
7459 4 easy installation. Just take me less than 10 min to get it done. adjustable aperture is another sweet design for home use. Take it as a pet cam for my puppies. 
7460 4 Very satisfied with the transaction. Camera has excellent features for the price and fits easily into my pocket. 
7461 4 camera will not hold charge and I don t think its the battery, this is fine. 
7462 1 Had a difficult time uploading the video. Still have problems so I don t use much. 
7463 4 Very good 
7464 3 Batteries are great! Don t work with cannon chargers but work with the one it came with 
7465 4 IT IS MADE BY HIKVISION, BUT IT IS OEM. GREAT PRICE! 
7466 4 great transaction. Product as described 
7467 4 This stand works with the Neewer Camera Photo/Video 18&#34;Outer 14&#34;Inner 600W 5500K Dimmable Ring Fluorescent Flash Light for video recording. 
7468 3 Its all I need 
7469 4 Amazing bargain for an image stabilizer. 
7470 4 Perfect just what we needed. 
7471 4 Excellent product 
7472 4 Great little noise maker. No one comes into the house without my knowledge!!!!! Km 
7473 4 Great product, as advertised. 
7474 0 It didn t fit! I tried to make it fit and it broke. Now I am $25 lighter in the wallet. 
7475 4 Super.... 
7476 3 Good deal, easy to use and well worth the money as a refurbished unit( can tell - it looks new). 
7477 4 One of the items I don t regret buying. I use it as a organizer case for my various electronic components in my backpack, not just for my camera when I travel. Very purposeful beyond its original intent. 
7478 4 Nice 
7479 4 Amazing and used it through out a trip with a lot of hiking. 
7480 4 Works like a charm, affordable. Sony should have included it with its camera products. 
7481 2 Not as powerful as I had hoped. 
7482 1 leaves little spots all over the sensor. 
7483 4 Cool Kit 
7484 0 useless I returned it 
7485 4 Thought I d take a chance on this and i wasn t disappointed...great item and well worth the money 
7486 4 Great grip! 
7487 1 while this may be a good camera, we had to return it because it s rather bulky. Should ve looked closer at the pictures. 
7488 3 Great long and skinny chealplace for covering a 1/4 20 screw into various 1/4 20 and one 3/4.. I wish it had more 3/4 but what can a guy do? Work for me but might not work in every mounting situation. Do some research before buying. 
7489 4 Good!! 
7490 2 Nothing fancy, gets the job done for light activity. 
7491 4 The Go Pro suction cup mount is a great tool. As long as the surface is smooth and clean, you should be able to mount it without issues. 
7492 4 Not bad optics for an inexpensive macro solution...the swingaway mount is nice and handy--I just leave it on the camera. Good purchase. 
7493 4 What can i say, it s small, its heavy duty, it holds your lens caps (that aren t attached) & it should be included in every camera strap you buy... but it s not. Way to go guys at Vonoto... you filled my need exactly. 
7494 4 Love being able to check on the dogs while I m at my office and see what s happening at home when we re not there. 
7495 4 Thank you 
7496 4 Works great. Kids have used it a lot. Seems very durable. Lots of fun! 
7497 3 very good 
7498 4 Great speedlight. Everyone needs one 
7499 0 Do Not buy, Cameras do not last indoors or outdoors. Have add trouble contacting sellers to try and replace cameras. One by one they each died. 
7500 4 This was simple to install and really easy to use. 
7501 3 Sometimes works, sometimes takes few more seconds, first I thought It was because the camera needed time to focus but realize later the remote sometimes doesn t send signal. Battery draws very fast. 
7502 4 good product for the price, does everything expected 
7503 4 I love it 
7504 4 Decent product for the price. 
7505 3 Great fit for GH4, does just what it says and what it is suppose to do. I am able to mount Leica R glass to the GH4, which provides some great unique looks to video and photos. Would recommend. 
7506 4 ok 
7507 4 Came super quick. Just as described. 
7508 3 nice 
7509 4 Great floats! Love the bright colors that easily stand out in the water! 
7510 3 Handy item for carrying and providing easy access to required filters. 
7511 4 After charging them in my new charger, they worked just fine in my camera. 
7512 4 perfect replacement for my broken door 
7513 4 Works Perfectly. It can even fit a small tablet like my nexus 7 
7514 4 Pricey but works 
7515 4 Exactly as expected. Perfect case for my camera. 
7516 4 Works 
7517 3 It does work good. 
7518 3 Actually pretty good quality. It was simple to put together, and surprisingly easy to transport. 
7519 4 Fantastic! Great price, perfect condition, works amazing. Very satisfied. 
7520 3 GREAT UNDERWATER CAMERA!!! 
7521 3 As long as you realize these are standard def products and they sometimes have issues recording, nobody can beat the price/quality. You wont be disappointed. 
7522 4 Good product. 
7523 2 Don t try to take dry pics after taking underwater pics, water droplets will remain on the camera making all the pics you take look warped. Its really quite annoying when trying to take selfies with my head above water. 
7524 4 I can t complain at all about this purchase, it works perfectly for my needs and never fails. 
7525 4 Awesome 
7526 4 Check out my video review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNJ-LqryG2s It s the perfect secondary camera to your primary vlogging camera. Audio is the best GoPro has to offer and video quality is up to date. If you want to see a comparison to the Silver look at the video above! 
7527 4 Works like a charm with my t5i.. I still have it 6 months later. The battery died but i just popped it out the bottom and replaced it. You dont have to keep buying it.. Just change the battery you guys. Lol 
7528 3 Looks good feels good, I have taken video through it but haven t used it under water yet. It didn t distort or interfere with the video or pictures at all. I would buy this product again and recommend it to friends. 
7529 4 Lightweight and useful. Get the job done. 
7530 4 Perfect replacement for the original piece. 
7531 3 Works well. Can t rotate upwards at all though. 
7532 3 works fine although battery was real low only 1 bar when I got it but it charged up fine. 
7533 4 Looks durable. Fits my 600EX-RT very well. 
7534 4 Exactly what I needed for my shotgun mic 
7535 4 easy to use, precise, its reading is constant, its a great deal. I love it. 
7536 3 I really like it. Its everything that i expected. If build quality is a big concern keep in mind that this is a 20 dollar shutter release. Don t expect any more than what your e paying for. 
7537 1 The price is good, but the batteries do not mark the used percentage correctly.. so they hapen to die at any time with no notice. they don t work for me. 
7538 2 I went into this knowing it wasn t a high-end technological marvel. I use it to view printed samples under pretty high magnification and it works OK. Not great, not worthless. Right smack dab in the middle for the price. 
7539 4 Works. Delivered fast. A+++ 
7540 0 After using the camera 8 Times( bought july 22nd) one button stop working. I just checked the return policy and just expired the 30 days window. What should i do? 
7541 4 Saved my day! Just the right fit and performance works as I would expect. 
7542 4 I needed AC power for video and stop motion projects. This thing did the trick for the price. Can t complain. 
7543 4 Works as expected. Nicely made with quality material. 
7544 4 I love my Polaroid 
7545 0 The grip was not equipped to attach to the camera. A 2nd one was ordered and it was also missing the connection between the grip and the camera body. 
7546 4 works well 
7547 4 Works as well as any other filter set - and reasonably priced. 
7548 3 The quality is ok, but only 2 axes is a bit of a pain. Not the fault of the seller but I should have paid more attention. Was a good price so I ll find some use for it. 
7549 1 Audio is worthless. 
7550 3 Long camera rod. limited adapters. Wish it was made of metal so I can use it as a weapon also for self defense 
7551 4 Great product great price 
7552 1 Get what you pay for...zippers pull apart and seams have torn after a few months of occasional use. Not professional at all. If you use in home studio and don t move...work fine. 
7553 3 Bought two, only issue was the first one was programmed in Japanese, both work well were not to difficult to install. Have not been able to get the reverse camera to put up the grid in reverse. The directions are rather skimpy. 
7554 4 These are so fun to play with and a great alternative to the expensive colored Film. These are cheap and way more options. 
7555 4 It worked out perfectly!! 
7556 4 Very mobile and charges my camera batteries very quickly. 
7557 4 Great camera!!!! 
7558 0 Was not the quality of camera I was expecting. No instruction manual to tell you about the camera settings or how to use them. Accessories not for the same camera. So disappointed......... 
7559 3 I have used this item several times and great for the money. Durable and sturdy. The only thing that I was not impressed or found challenging was putting it together, but after watching several Youtube views I finally got it. Easy to pack way and comes with convenient carrying case. 
7560 1 TTL not reliable 
7561 0 This item does not project a clear video at night. When it switches over to black and white, there is a glare in picture- reflecting the camera image and as soon as it switches back over to color, the camera video looks fine. 
7562 4 Couldn t be happier! What a vendor! 
7563 4 small and sharp the lens hood doesn t lock falls off all the time pic come out sharp 
7564 4 very good item delivered as expected. 
7565 4 All good.. Perfect match.. 
7566 4 Great Selfie Stick There are so many selfie sticks available how do I choose? The fact of the matter is that most of them are very similar. Aluminum color, removable phone holder, & built in Bluetooth.The selfie is for fun and functional. 
7567 4 Works as advertised! I was a bit concerned about getting a generic battery for my camera, but with the official Sony battery being WAY too expensive, this was the only way to go. It worked flawlessly and gave me no issues at all. 
7568 1 The unit itself is decent the cameras are great resolution, but amcrest DVR s offer more capabilities, and worse yet the Hard drive failed in less than a week, requiring a warranty repair. 
7569 4 Does everything I wanted it to do. 
7570 4 Just a little tight, buts works great! 
7571 0 very small size, puffy, not comportable 
7572 4 Excellent for protecting artwork purchased at conventions. The sleeves can be full of static when you open them, so some weights of paper will be harder to put in than others will. 
7573 4 Service was execellent item arrived a day earlier than expected I couldn t be more happy I would recommend to anyone 
7574 3 So far so good! 
7575 3 I am pleased with the product so far - it seems to have a good line of vision. Vincent was a great help to get my cameras set up on my wifi network 
7576 4 Cool 
7577 4 Great lens. People suggest this lens s boca effect is better than that of the 50mm f1.8 but I disagree! But it is a great lens to get those wider angle shots that you can t get with the 50mm. This and my 50mm make an awesome film making duo. 
7578 4 ok 
7579 1 I wanted to like this... I really really did. But it cannot hold the weight of a flash, receiver and umbrella. No matter how tight I made it. An entire shoot it was sideways. 
7580 0 Did not fit with the bundled flash unit. If seller is reading was disappointed with something that did not work. Less trouble to throw in the closet then return. 
7581 4 Great for the price, arrived quickly and fit my camera well. 
7582 4 easy to set up and excellent quality great customer service 
7583 0 it didnt fit 
7584 4 my wife loves her fujifilm instant camera. this is a bulk deal. 
7585 4 omg good 
7586 4 After using a different DVR system that just didn t quite match our needs, we came across this item and they are working perfectly. 
7587 4 Real like 
7588 4 Worked great 
7589 4 GREAT! Perfect for my needs. Highly recommend for home studio 
7590 4 The ball head is light enough not to put weight on a supporting arm, and strong enough to put a couple of lights or voice recorder on at no problem. It s nice to have several of them at my disposal. 
7591 4 High quality Fast delivery 
7592 3 my goddaughter loved her gift 
7593 4 Should have bought this sooner. I use the Manfrottos at work, bought this for personal use. I like it far more, though I wish the feet could be removed completely. 
7594 4 No more AA batteries and the weight that goes with them. 
7595 2 Works fine; fair quality. Better if had shutter activation button, available for same price in stores or online. 
7596 4 The product is great and easy to use, but the instructions are in broken english and don t really make sense. 
7597 4 These worked great for replacing existing switches that were damaged during window replacement.... Came with stick on double sided tape to make install on vinyl windows a snap... 
7598 0 Very disappointed. I own a60 d and side by side the t5i did not perform well. Indoor shots very dark and unfocused not sure if I got a bad copy of why. 
7599 2 cheaply made, does the job but you have to be careful with the case or it will break 
7600 4 Excellent toy 
7601 4 Highly rated for a reason! This camera does it all, and it had easy setup and easy operation. So pleased, we will be getting more! 
7602 2 good 
7603 1 Loved the length! but the sound quality is horrible, sometimes it sounded like i was under water! 
7604 4 Charged the batteries and they are working with no issues. Work in my Canon 70D just as advertised. 
7605 4 i m actually impressed by this. video is actually surprisingly good. pictures, not so hot. it has it s applications. 
7606 4 The picture quality is amazing. The camera was recommended by my fried that is a photographer and it has exceeded my expectations. Fantastic camera, great price and it comes with everything you need! 
7607 4 It was fun to be able to actually see the photos and pass them around for a laugh or too. to compare the dress up of the kids immediately was loads of fun. 
7608 4 He print a handbook for me, thanks a lt. 
7609 3 Good. 
7610 4 Exactly as described works wonderfully with our LG G4, no third party app needed. Very fast shipping.. 
7611 4 Good price. Go through these pretty fast with Arlo cameras. 
7612 4 This charger works great. With the wake feature I was able charge my old battery that wouldn t charge from my original Canon charger. The display is nice as it gives you a better idea as to the charge level and completion. 
7613 4 OEM, no quality problem 
7614 4 Works fine 
7615 3 Nicely made. Some pre-cut foam areas are oddly shaped and GoPro accessories won t fit. 
7616 0 plastic that you cannot even use. This appears to be a solid snap on piece like the water case, it is not. it is in fact a rubber mold, all one piece and was worthless. I trashed it. 
7617 4 nice package, everything included. 
7618 0 Not worth the money! 
7619 4 so far so good great for the cost. Batteries aren t the snuggest but it works and they stay put 
7620 4 Great replacement cords for the Zendure. Nice/fair price for three pack of replacement cords. Highly recommend! 
7621 4 Though not made by Nikon, this package is worth every dime spent. All items worked as described. Who could ask for anything more. 
7622 3 it works very good. 
7623 4 works perfectly. 
7624 4 I love it. It is worthwhile to buy it. 
7625 4 By far the best camera for a beginner and someone looking to start photography. As many of the other reviews have stated, the tripod is extremely flimsy but everything else in the package will exceed all of your expectations. This is definitely worth the price. You won t be disappointed. 
7626 4 Great product works great 
7627 1 Would not buy this again. The camera quality is not there but the app is even worse i gave up on it and now the camera sits in a box. 
7628 3 Picture could be a little clearer and instructions should be in larged. Not read the fine print. 
7629 4 Arrived as promised and was the proper battery worked just fine, already charged. 
7630 4 ok 
7631 4 Low price. Works great. 
7632 0 Some film didn t come out 
7633 3 Awesome camera 
7634 2 Kind of wimpy and cheap style 
7635 4 Perfect fitting adapter. Couldn t ask for any more from a $20 adapter. 
7636 4 We got this for my daughter s 13th birthday. She loves it! 
7637 4 Received as pictured. 
7638 4 great little bits to keep in the bits-n-pieces camera stuff 
7639 3 Ok but still not the standard fifty 
7640 1 Didn t get the 1/4 inch loops for the camera bodies???? The strap feels good but I was a tad disappointed to discover the item was not complete... I m assuming the camera connection screws were supposed to be in the kit? 
7641 3 Can t beat it for the price! 
7642 4 Perfect little album 
7643 0 Did not work 
7644 4 Great product. Lost one Samsung phone in the lake when we hit a wake, between a dry bag and the yellow floats, this won t happen again. 
7645 0 Doesn t work in lowlight. 
7646 4 Works much better than other products on the market. I m satisfied. 
7647 4 Good for price exactly what I expected no more or less 
7648 4 This is a great little attachment. I was leaving my lens cap off and misplacing it constantly, until I attached one of these. Simple and effective. 
7649 4 Great product and fast shipping 
7650 4 great product would recommend it 
7651 4 Used to keep an eye on my dog during the day... and be able to tell her to knock it off if she s doing something naughty! Great product, super easy to set up. Very pleased. 
7652 4 Tighten the screws on the legs.. Other than that great tripod 
7653 4 I couldn t resist the style or Amazon s great price on this adorable, functional new leather case for my new Sony camera! 
7654 4 Excellent product 
7655 3 If your GoPro is attached to a selfie stick, you will need to use both floaties. Good stuff! 
7656 0 imitation, fake, counterfeit 
7657 1 Material that touches my neck irritates it. Wish i hadn t wasted my money. 
7658 4 Great camera, fast shipping 
7659 4 What a handy guide to have in your bag. I ve read the books and now carry this reference guide with me. Good advice for mere pennies. 
7660 4 Great stand for shooting YouTube videos with my iPhone. It s totally flexible and works great! 
7661 4 Love these filters, they really do let your high-end lenses perform. Cheap filters can add a lot of crap to an otherwise great lens. 
7662 4 Was a very quick order actually received two days ahead of schedule, extras in box were a nice touch and unexpected. Was quite happy with lense itself... 
7663 4 it works fine, fast delivery. 
7664 3 I like it,would like it better if it came with an ac\dc power chord. 
7665 0 barley holds to the glass 
7666 4 Loved it! 
7667 1 Unable to figure it out. Still trying. 
7668 4 Pointless A/V out, it already had Mini HDMI. an A/V Input would be much more useful 
7669 3 Works as advertised. I look at the sun daily, if it s out. Only drawback was that the telescope fits very tightly in the case. 
7670 3 Great lens! A little distortion though, but has worked well for astrophotography for me on sony a6000 
7671 3 Don t crank the head all the way up or it will stick. Other than that, it s great. 
7672 4 Works great 
7673 4 working great 
7674 4 Fits magic mouse VERY snug. 
7675 0 Terrible resolución only works with one user lags all the time, kills phone battery. worst camera on the market. 
7676 4 Just what I needed 
7677 4 Item was as expected and promptly arrived on time 
7678 4 Was just what I wanted. 
7679 2 The charger works great, but rating the Smatree Batteries at 1200mah is disingenuous. Neither last as long as an original GoPro battery rated at much less. 
7680 4 excellent product. 
7681 2 works but screams cheap. my MOVO motorized head is infinitely better for not much more money and also can be controlled as to transit and duration. 
7682 4 Solid filter, smooth rotation. I can t find any faults. Love this company s attention to detail and customer service followup. If you re looking for a CPL on a budget, Breakthrough s X1 is a solid choice. 
7683 3 I think this kit has all the accessories I can use to keep my Pentax K-50 camera clean and in good condition. 
7684 4 A good replacement for the original supply. 
7685 4 it fits perfect on my advance mini shoe of a Vixia HF G20, 
7686 3 only one zipper, so they leak a little. i ordered them to hold down soccer PUG s, and they work great for that. 
7687 4 Fit perfectly and if you wash it first and hang it moist it will dry smooth. 
7688 4 Works well and is reasonably priced. Next time, I would buy the larger size because the 3&#34; X 5&#34; size is just a little bit too small to handle effectively. 
7689 4 Love it 
7690 0 would not charge 
7691 4 perfect! 
7692 4 For the price it s amazing. 
7693 4 It s a good switch for dimming. It requires a neutral but it seems to dim smaller numbers of LEDs better than Lutron s non-neutral offerings. Just make sure you have access to the RadioRA 2 software beforehand. 
7694 4 Good product 
7695 2 Its a good little fanny pack, my guess is you pay a lot for the name. Also, despite the photo it does not come with a water bottle holder. 
7696 0 The camera would not generate the IP address needed for set up. Tech support started out with &#34;is it plugged in&#34;, seriously. I spent several hours troubleshooting, waste of time. 
7697 4 Very good equipment 
7698 4 very cute camera, can be powered by usb cable via computer. Easy set up, two way audio is very clear, clear picture. very suitable for baby room. 
7699 4 Better than I expected. Very sturdy and well built for the price. Only con is the lower section needs to be a little deeper. 
7700 4 We now have 3 of these around the house. They work well & allow me to keep an eye on my kids while they re in their rooms! Love them! 
7701 4 Hold the camera and fits over my fat head. No complaints. 
7702 4 awesome 
7703 2 Great Value! 
7704 4 Works as advertised and screen is easy to see 
7705 4 Easy and fun to use! 
7706 4 loving it 
7707 4 Great case!!! 
7708 4 great case love it 
7709 4 nice item 
7710 4 A great design, I ve used it numerous times already, the way it attached to a belt loop is great, (an angle) great zippers, great design and materials for my Sony Camera. 
7711 2 Works great, but it s literally just a 60minute egg timer. You can easily make one yourself for just a few bucks and a little ingenuity. 
7712 4 Works great, extra batteries are more powerful than the original camera battery. Very good price. 
7713 4 Exelent 
7714 4 Love it 
7715 0 this is a piece of junk. Wifi camera won t start Web site is in chinese - no help there. Instructions are very confusing 
7716 4 Love them easy to put on and take off and gives some supper pictures !!!!! Thanks Deb 
7717 4 Bought to store cigars while camping. 
7718 4 Camera arrived as advertised. Very pleased with it. No issues. 
7719 4 Excelente 
7720 4 Price was right and it continues to work well 6 months later. 
7721 3 Connects my camera to the DVR on my surveillance system. They do the job. 
7722 2 Easy to set up, stable won t tip over. mine had no carry case if it did it would get another star. Works get for product pictures on a white back ground, not so goof for clothing site. Room will not warm up much. 
7723 3 Great idea but little pricey. Janeb 
7724 4 High quality. Excellent 
7725 1 Works great until they break at the foot of the 600ex-rt. 2 recent ones broke only after several months of use - the plastic used here apparently is not nearly as good as previous versions. 
7726 4 A++++++++ Highly Recommend 
7727 3 Turned out to be a little smaller than I was hoping for, but I still love it!! Really only fits my camera with a lens attached and then a second lens. 
7728 4 Great product and prompt shipment! Thanks!! 
7729 4 great price 
7730 4 This is excellent for those occasions when you have to work without an assistant. 
7731 4 Great little flashlight. And it really is waterproof. 
7732 0 Looks like a toy. Doesn t work as great as i thought it would. 
7733 4 If your an action person, excellent 
7734 4 Fits nicely, makes using the GoPro while riding a motorbike or even driving much safer 
7735 2 It has a nice feel, but with the weight distribution it was hard to keep from spinning. 
7736 4 These studio lights serve their purpose. What a great purchase. 
7737 4 Fantastic! Planning on purchasing the DCR-250 as well! 
7738 4 Fits my camera perfectly. 
7739 3 It has high-quality video capabilities but it is not as functional as the FujiKam HD. It is stationary and cannot be moved remotely using the available mobile app. 
7740 4 Nice thick cables, worked well. 
7741 4 Always buy extras so you have them to replace if you shoot a lot out doors. 
7742 2 Battery works well in Nikon camera. I have had them for a few months now and under moderate use the batteries do now not hold a charge as long as they did initially. 
7743 4 Thankyou 
7744 4 well I am trying the tummy slimming body women s shapewear it is made with quality material and is very interesting to wear feels great..great product..I received this product in exchange for an honest review.. 
7745 4 My daughter is a youtube wannabe star so I had to set her up right! she loves it 
7746 0 Does not come with the case as descibed. Will not work without it. 
7747 4 Works as advertised and expected of a Nikon product. 
7748 4 Great package of products! Everything you need to start taking great pictures. Very pleased. 
7749 4 Wow! This a the perfect case for the Phantom. It is well designed and tough! 
7750 3 Good quality --better made than most albums at this price. I will buy another one. 
7751 3 Does what I need as extra battery power 
7752 4 Charged batteries one time so far with no problems. 
7753 4 Love these little albums. Perfect for mini 8 camera. The color of the album matches my camera. Love that. 
7754 4 Got it fast, works great. I absolutely love this feature on the Nikon D3300. 
7755 2 The color is great but it requires a lot of editing to smooth out the background. This is my only seamless that shows up as wrinkled/dented in photos. 
7756 4 so cool - my daughter is having a blast using this and all her friends are looking into getting one as well 
7757 3 Great delivery time. Work great. 
7758 4 Product as promised 
7759 4 Great tripod! Inexpensive, but works well for iPhone 6+ and my Nikon D300. 
7760 4 Simple to set up, clear picture quality. 
7761 3 Not the best, but very usefull! 
7762 3 Surprisingly solid. 
7763 4 This is great. Wish I had gotten it BEFORE the screen got all scratched up in the first place. 
7764 4 The Clik holds my D700 with battery holder and 15-30, 2.8 lenses attached, 2 flashes, 2 other lenses and my 13&#34; macbook pro and all essentials. Great comfortable backpack. 
7765 4 dropped it and it still works! Takes great pictures, get a lot of good comments on them. recommended to my friends who ask what camera it is. 
7766 4 Very good product works great only thing I would do is bring back wave points 
7767 4 I travel with SLR & Hasselblad camera equipment. This shoulder pad will work on any strap. If you need relief from weight ..this strap is it. 
7768 0 Just don t do it...... Had to send my camera to Canon after this caused my camera to short. $400 to fix the camera. Just don t buy it..... If you buy it make sure you don t use it. 
7769 3 Have taken awesome pictures with it still don t think I have met full potential 
7770 4 Totally cute! 
7771 3 I do like this product. My only complaint is that the straps could be a little bit longer. It works as advertised, keeping the camera stable at your side. It is much, much better than your typical neck strap. 
7772 4 I have my car as and equipment in this case. I love the protective compartments in the case. 
7773 4 Very happy 
7774 4 Absolutely an amazing lens, even on my outdated Epl-5. 
7775 2 bad focus 
7776 4 Fits - timely delivery 
7777 4 Great case! 
7778 4 love the low profile and wide base, great for bench rest shooting for my spotting scope 
7779 3 Works good. 
7780 4 Works fine 
7781 0 This Camera is no where near 1080p full hd...very graining videos ....here is a sample video http://youtu.be/xlbcBhx98NI

7785 4 It is very useful. 
7786 4 Beautiful and beautifully crafted! Absolutely love this. Quick delivery as well. 
7787 4 Item arrived on time and works great! 
7788 4 It worked well straight out of the box. the packing was adequate to protect it and assure safe arrival. The arrival was timely as advertised. 
7789 0 not for a nex 3 
7790 4 Love it! 
7791 0 I guess I missed the part about this being a flimsy tripod, but then you get what you pay for I guess. 
7792 4 Very nice picture,easy to use and works better than three other brands bought. 
7793 0 This item broke within 10 minutes of me wearing it. I am very dissatisfied with this product. My camera is now sunk to the bottom of the ocean floor due to their faulty product. 
7794 3 this is a great case. i wish the leather looked a little more weathered. it s a little plastic like look but it s ok. hopefully it wears out a little to give it a cooler older look. 
7795 4 Everyone needs one of these.... unless you don t know how flight works. Then please, for the love of God, don t. 
7796 0 They didn t explain how to use them so they are pretty worthless. 
7797 4 Works as expected. Fits wrist comfortably; floats camera. Good quality. 
7798 3 Good size and light weight, the zipper tag did rip making the zipper only 3/4 to close the bag. 
7799 4 Good Quality! 
7800 4 Sturdy, well-built piece of gear. Able to shoot in landscape or portrait orientation with simple twist of the locking knob to rotate the swivel head. 
7801 4 it worked great 
7802 4 Awesome! 
7803 4 Just what I wanted. 
7804 4 Older camcorder and the power adapter got lost. Now I can down load all those 8mm videos.... 
7805 4 My daughter and her hubby love them. If they are happy, so am I !! 
7806 4 Great light protective cover 
7807 4 quick delivery. Would order again 
7808 4 love it...light! 
7809 4 Awesome camera!! 
7810 4 Bought and shipped from Chinese dealer for $100.00 US. The price was GREAT and it arrived new in the box. It works perfectly. I would avoid all non OEM adapters as they are all loose fitting. 
7811 3 Needs a carry case. Works great even though color temp should be 5500 instead of 5400. It s still a little green. Not a problem with white balance. 
7812 4 Great deal! 
7813 4 they did really geart ,we got al lot of photos from these cameras 
7814 4 Love being able to take anywhere and the selfi feature! 
7815 4 Great camera. Good transaction. 
7816 4 Fit perfectly wirh my sony a6000 camera. Thanks. 
7817 0 This product may work well, but I wanted and expected it to be white (looks very white on your web site). It is gray!! Now what? 
7818 4 Its not an expensive filter, works well for the price but when you want high quality in your pictures buy a high quality filter. 
7819 4 thin , easy to use 
7820 4 great camera. Takes great pics for the money 
7821 4 good 
7822 4 Very nice quality! Filled with gravel and despite the weight it is holding up well! I especially like the double zipper. I doesn t give me the impression it s going to open and spill the contents everywhere. The size also fits securely over my tripod legs. Highly recommend! 
7823 2 Everything went fine 
7824 4 Perfect size for a 7&#34; monitor and cords. 
7825 4 They are pretty much perfect. Durable, open wide enough, not too expensive. I m happy with my purchase. 
7826 4 Great product 
7827 4 Works great when changing telescope lenses at night. Well made. Highly recommended. 
7828 3 Filters worked great in 20-40 feet of water. I don t have experience with other filters but it was much better than no filter at all. We slipped the filter on after submerging to prevent bubbles. 
7829 3 Really good definition and practic. 
7830 4 great bag, it has a weather proof cover in the front zippered area 
7831 4 Awesome, floats and good quality fit 
7832 4 The battery can last around 3 hours after one charge.It works great on my 2m LED strip. The LED indicator on battery shows on or off of switch. It turns green while battery be full charged, Great 
7833 4 Works great!! I bought this with the ASUS S1 LED Projector, and they are a perfect combo!! 
7834 4 Works surprisingly well. I wiped significant grease and smudges off my sunglasses with no cleaning solution or water. 
7835 4 The originals at a reasonable price quickly delivered 
7836 2 it works 
7837 2 The zipper is hard and bendibg didnt think a higer tier pro bag will be that hard to close zipper my canon 6d fits inside even with a battery grip with a tiny bit of pressure and kit lens 24-105 attached gave it 3* only because of the bending zipper 
7838 0 This charger worked great for 3 months and then died. 
7839 4 Love love love! Can t stop taking pictures!! 
7840 4 The camera and accessories were the highlight of the party. The kids were able to take pictures home to keep rather than waiting for the emails. The different lenses and the covers for the pictures worked out well. 
7841 4 Have yet to try it snorkeling, but above water it is fine. 
7842 4 Lightweight and durable. 
7843 0 We got these for our Arlo security system. Even fully charged, they did not show as &#34;fully charged&#34; They were dead in a matter of hours. Definitely not worth the price. 
7844 0 Not very secure or stable 
7845 3 Small and effecient. Foot adhesive was a bit frail. One of the feet pulled off. 
7846 4 Great camera, great seller. 
7847 4 Pleasure doing business with! Everything as promised! 
7848 3 The only thing that I am a little disapointed in is that it is not fully waterproof. Thanks for your quick delivery Vic Sheahan 
7849 4 Just right 
7850 4 Works great. Very adjustable. 
7851 3 Much larger and bulkier than the Nikon version. 
7852 3 Good unit at the right price. Make certain the focal plane is absolutely vertical, and you will yield great results. 
7853 4 Exactly what I needed and at a very reasonable price. 
7854 0 Never work....... Waist of money. 
7855 1 At least half of these so far have had little to no charge but still way cheaper then the energizer or Duracell options. 
7856 2 Meh. The tripod broke almost right away, so don t buy it for that. The rest was OK. 
7857 4 Perfect 
7858 4 This product was smashing amazing. Arrived so quick and was well packaged. Great explaination of how to apply it. And I wasn t expecting to get protector for the view finder and the control panel. So was really impressed. 
7859 3 Good case 
7860 2 Buyer beware! It is O K for the price. Sometimes it does not work. 
7861 4 awesome product. I have tried some of the standalone versions, some cheaper some more expensive. This has been the best by far. 
7862 3 This is a very sturdy and useful mount. I use it frequently in the shoulder position. I m impressed at its stability. It s a very clever and flexible design and has encouraged more frequent usage of my Action Cam. 
7863 4 Great filter. 
7864 2 I am sure that it will be fine when I finally receive the Adapter/Charger which has been delayed twice already! 
7865 4 This bag has all I need, I am very happy with the size and all storage bags it has. In summary this bag is perfect to someone that loves to travel light but with everything necessary to take good photographies. 
7866 2 Not interactive window. Otherwise nice case 
7867 0 Does not support the weight of my standard digital slr camera. 
7868 4 Just as described works perfect I would recommend this product to family and friends 
7869 1 TriPod stand broke after a few uses 
7870 4 Work well to protect lenses. 
7871 4 Fantastic macro lens for close-up nature photography and slight telephoto (like a 60 mm on an old film slr.) Excellent price. It s a little bigger than a compact telephoto. Works well with my ds5500. I am very pleased with this lens. Bought from Beach camera- great, fast shipping. 
7872 4 Cheaper than old polaroid film and better imho 
7873 1 The lense does a great job. I paid for the 2x converter as well but didn t get it. So you won t get everything you pay for, beware. 
7874 4 As good as expected slowmo 60fps and 120fps amazing quality and with removable Battery plus 2 hour record fantasic for Martial arts if your an instructor. Price is another plus looking at another since I use the three camera setup. Back up good idea 
7875 4 JUST GOT IT TODAY...BETTER THAN I EXPECTED!!! THANK YOU 
7876 3 Works great, much better pic than the cheap one I had before, I need to get the second one installed out back real soon. 
7877 4 I use a pair of these to place multiple flash heads in 72 inch parabolic umbrellas for large group shots. It is well-built and sturdy. 
7878 3 Works great 
7879 4 Excellent case! It gives plenty of room for all the various items you need for a day of flying! 
7880 2 Almost completely satisfied but one of the lens did not fit my camera! 
7881 4 Excelente!! 
7882 4 Nice ..big ..great price 
7883 3 Everything was as stated and good quality for a great price. 
7884 4 Works great and has last up to my teenager thumping it around in the camera bag. 
7885 0 cannot get sound to work and pic quality is real bad, will never get another one. 
7886 4 Easy hookup and met my expectation: now i can finally spy on my neighbors. 
7887 4 Good quality, worked well. 
7888 4 Perfect camera 
7889 4 Room for my quick disconnect prop guards, 3 batteries, my tablet, controller and my props. Great quality! 
7890 3 Good 
7891 4 Exactly what I needed. Great price. Works as advertised. 
7892 0 It did not come with a selfie camera, so while it still works as an Instax, I give it one star for lying on its description. 
7893 4 I am electrical engineer with RF / wireless & US air force sensors training. it is hard to imagine a better value for home alarms than this fortress system...highly recommended :) 
7894 4 Great to have it. nice packaged. 
7895 4 great 
7896 4 I was looking for a good time laps camera release...WORKS GREAT 
7897 4 This little camera recorded the burglary of my home. Police officers viewing images captured the by Nest Cam recognized the robber! Now the crook is in jail with his 6th burglary charge. Can t brag enough about this camera. 
7898 4 GREAT 
7899 4 My kid loved it 
7900 0 Terrible quality 
7901 4 better than expected for the price 
7902 0 Say somthing and comes opposite 
7903 1 Battery doesn t last long. It died to quickly. 
7904 4 fits stands and umbrellas 
7905 4 The camera and kit were exactly what I expected and worked perfectly. 
7906 4 Amazing little camera!! Very interested in seeing the next release as well! Very cool device! The size is amazing and the quality is pretty good too. Battery life is not so great, but to be expected with the size of the device as well as reading other reviews. 
7907 4 Great item -reat Product - love the way it operates so smoothly. 
7908 4 Well worth cost. Batteries work great. 
7909 4 Works for me. 
7910 4 An excellent alternative to OEM 70-300mm lens — just as good as Nikon or Canon for less money. 
7911 4 It works great and the price is very good. 
7912 4 Excellent little battery and price point. 
7913 4 fast delivery. Good product. 
7914 4 this camera is really neat. the service folks were great. I highly recommend fujicam 8/10/2015 
7915 4 Fits just fine on my hero 4 black. I was a little scared at first that i would break it trying to get the case over the camera, but it seems to be pretty durable. Best thing is that you can charge the camera while it is in the case. 
7916 4 Does the job! It is pretty big, bigger than I expected. I didn t really pay too close attention when I ordered it or I would have gotten the medium just because it would be easier to store. 
7917 4 Perfect case to put all my lenses and bodies together for a remote shoot. 
7918 4 My fiancé loved using it at the beach! 
7919 4 I am very happy with the accessory kit I received for my Nikon Coolpix AW 120. I would recommend this to anyone. 
7920 4 Nice little package. Everything I wanted and expected. 
7921 0 Not even got the charge, and this is the second one i bough from Amazon the first one was broken at the time of delivery.

7925 4 Charged my Canon battery as soon as I received this charger, no problems at all in installing or charging. 
7926 4 Arrived 4 dias before! excelent! 
7927 4 Great and fast service 
7928 4 Nice Tripod, very stable and easy to use! 
7929 0 Sent it back. Instructions way too complicated for my technology capable husband. A gift for him. He spent one entire day trying to input a all the info. I should have listened to the reviews I read and bought something else. 
7930 4 Works well 
7931 0 Hard to setup. And battery life sucks. Will be returning it 
7932 4 Batteries fit well and last as long as the OEM battery at a great price. Love being able to charge 3 batteries at a time. 
7933 4 Great item, very strong base. Thank You 
7934 4 Product was exactly as described and at a great price and very fast delivery !!! Will be back to this sellers page !!!

7937 4 Shipping was fast and order was exactly what was described. No complaints on this order 
7938 0 Poor quality. You can get the same quality for $4 in Chinatown 
7939 3 love it!!! 
7940 4 I really like this camera, its light and easy to carry around with me and have a manual mode. 
7941 4 OK so far.. No problems to report. 
7942 1 Optic are kind of okay but your phone adopter is very poorly made it it is off the track very easy and flimsy!!! 
7943 4 Excelent product 
7944 2 Good! 
7945 4 Very fun glad I had it for my trip! 
7946 4 Excellent product. Thanks! 
7947 4 This camcorder looks absolutely gorgeous. Once you get used to the controls which are very simple, using it becomes second nature. The recording quality is great. Truly a great deal. 
7948 1 Snapped in riptide current. 
7949 4 Gracias! 
7950 4 Great! 
7951 4 The UV Filter was an excellent product and is working very well. 
7952 0 did not work well. 
7953 4 Very easy to apply - just follow the instructions. All but invisible when fitted and works exactly as described. 
7954 4 What s not to love? It s the Cadillac of quads, the one against which all others are measured. 
7955 4 Great camera with an impressive zoom. Haven t tried the wi-fi feature yet. Controls are logical and easy to use. 
7956 4 Very cute, makes great pictures 
7957 4 as advertised 
7958 3 I own Lion Security Specialist Inc.to compete i look for great values and this was one, thank you Amazon. 
7959 2 Had issues with the battery! would not take full charge. 
7960 4 My daughter is very pleased with the gift I got her. 
7961 3 Feels cheap but its works fine. 
7962 4 It was cheap and it works 
7963 4 Got it fast and works perfect. Nice to have an extra, I m sure I will order another as I tend to lose these 
7964 0 This was a European model so the power supply had a European plug Had to call and buy a 120v power supply...bummer 
7965 0 i can t believe this. the software is on amazon although foxhole has stopped supporting it. so why was it sold to me and why did i waste my time learning how to use a software that is no longer supported? This is a matter worthy of litigation 
7966 4 So far so good. What an awesome deal! Exactly as described. 
7967 4 Item is as described. Works great. 
7968 0 Junk. I was trying to save money but instead got a flash that fell apart, didn t work, and took up space in my bag. Spend the extra and get the one for your camera from the manufacture. 
7969 4 Fits screen perfectly and stays where you need it. I will getting more of these for sure. 
7970 4 very nice step up ring, my lenses and filters love it. 
7971 4 Great image quality, awesome zoom. Great versatility in choosing photography settings, as well as making movies with zoom or making highspeed video (slow motion). And all in one rather compact camera. 
7972 2 Good charger Worthless batteries 
7973 4 Batteries seem to work as advertised. No long term experience yet. Delivery was much sooner than expected. 
7974 4 EXCELLENT COMPLETELY MET MY EXPECTATION 
7975 4 perfect. this one is your absolute best bet. i ordered another brand before this one for less money and had to throw it out. this one is well worth the money, bulit well and works as it should. 
7976 4 I see you 
7977 4 I take this everywhere I go. I havent met someone who has had this one yet but i always get some looks for having the coolest pole. The grip is comfortable and the arm extends to a pretty decent length. Its sturdy even when extended. Highly recommend! 
7978 4 Excellent screen protection film kit which I bought from Amazon UK and applied to both of my Pentax 645D camera bodies. Very easy to apply, it is giving good protection to two cameras in constant daily use. Thoroughly recommended, a great product. 
7979 3 I like this tripod for what i need it for which is not every day use. Its definitely sturdy for my camera. Only complaint the quick release plate had a piece fall off of it the first day. But i am pretty happy with it 
7980 4 loved this fits everything you need for a shorter trips! 
7981 0 Defective 
7982 4 Love this camera. It is versatile and easy enough for the point and shoot crowd, but allows novices to advance to intermediates and it allows intermediates to move up a few levels. 
7983 4 Easy to use and clarity is awesome 
7984 2 Light and junky but gets the job done. 
7985 4 LOVE having a spare battery while vacationing! 
7986 4 Works perfectly with my Canon Rebel T5. Very economical and you can t beat the performance. 
7987 3 Not too bad for the price 
7988 4 VERY NICE THANKS GUYS !! 
7989 0 Watch for Warranty! Got 2 of this a couple of month ago and 1 got out of order, and Hikvision refused it s warranty coverage. Very bad![[ASIN:B00G7GMEOG Hikvision DS-2CD2032-I Outdoor HD 3MP IP Bullet Security Camera 4mm]] 
7990 0 Returned it due to difficulty setting up. 
7991 4 Has worked great. 
7992 3 We got these for the father-in-law who misplaced the charger for his camera. This package with two additional batteries was the perfect answer to prepare the father-in-law with everything he needed for a week long trip to the National Parks. 
7993 4 High quality and a reasonable price. Smooth rotating and good results (as good as the photographer). Why paying so many $ for other. Very satisfied. 
7994 4 Smooth transaction. Fast shipping. A+++. Thanks!!! 
7995 4 My 13 year old Granddaughter loves it ! 
7996 3 Just as described. 
7997 2 I ve yet to be able to get it to work correctly...but I m hopeful 
7998 4 I have been having entirely too much fun with this lens. 
7999 4 Can t go wrong for the price. 
8000 2 Worked fine until she took it and got it stolen. 
8001 4 Plenty stout and versatile for my full sized rebel Cannon digital camera. 
8002 4 Not only does it have physical zoom, it has a digital zoom. Even at maximum zoom the pictures are crisp and clear. Easy to use. Great pictures. What a camera is supposed to do. Have not tried the video. Still it does what I want. Anything else is pure bonus. 
8003 3 works fine but found the lost one two hours after i ordered this one 
8004 3 good value, it supports my heavy 20-60 x 80mm Vortex Viper spotting scope well. A product really has to knock my socks off to get a 5 star 
8005 4 As advertised. Great camera, arrived on time. 
8006 3 Works great Extra one in case I lose the first one 
8007 4 Excellent product, first I bought 1 camera after I installed by the way easy installation , the night vision is way better them those expensive ones. I decided to buy two more , clean colors ind zoom work great. 
8008 3 It s very nice, works well 
8009 4 Love camera and All the advantages 
8010 1 Two day prime was five days! And the new camera I bought may have been factory reconditioned. Charger and Battery don t work. have to return. Either bad luck or bad business... 
8011 3 Feels big and cheap, especially compared to the OEM charger, but it works. 
8012 4 잘 받았습니다 I received well! Actually i canceled many times(of dollar converting issues) but seller didn t care when i saw. anyway thanks x 1000000 times!!! have a nice day ~ (from korea) 
8013 4 good 
8014 3 Works good! got it set up in no time. 
8015 4 works as described good fitment 
8016 4 Excellent, fast and small. 
8017 4 Gorgeous packaging and a nice little velvet case. Works flawlessly, with a larger button that is easier to press than the stock one I lost. Great purchase! The slide-out easy battery replacement is a plus also. 
8018 3 it works. 
8019 3 as described. 
8020 3 Good Value for a case. the foam is easy to use and customize. quality is not premium, but it is quite good and good enough for most uses. 
8021 4 excellent product. 
8022 3 I happy with it. Just wish it had a rechargeable battery. 
8023 0 No happy with this product. No smooth swivel action. Very jerky and hard to turn. I never should have bought. 
8024 3 Great product that fits perfectly onto my stands that I use for video and photography. A little on the cheaper side but still gets the job done nonetheless. Holds my flashes just fine. 
8025 4 I love it! very nice and trendy. I received the item earlier than I expected. Thank you Amazon and MegaGear. 
8026 4 This is my 2nd Panasonic 7-14. I flooded my original lens by accident getting out of my kayak. The Panasonic GX7 camera the lens was attached to had no such issues and survived the dunking quite well. This sample and my original 7-14 lens were remarkably sharp and well corrected. 
8027 4 Yes, it works and the arduino knows about it. 
8028 3 Fantastic product. It feels like part of the camera. I should have picked the darker leather, but that s my fault. 
8029 4 love it. 
8030 2 Did not come with the two rubber inserts. 
8031 4 It is a very good starter set for this camera 
8032 4 I took it to Hawaii and went zip lining! They had a helmet with a GroPro clip! Its small but mighty 
8033 3 Great camera, has everything I need to get started. This is my first DSLR and I find it quite easy to use. 
8034 4 This is a great camera bag. Highly recommend. 
8035 4 Great product as described!!! Awesome seller! 
8036 4 I love flashpoint products, this one is no different. The diffuser cover is a bit fussy to get on, but it s really not an issue. 
8037 4 This innocent looking motion detector is fantastic. Picture quality is great. No one should notice their real purpose of video surveillance. 
8038 4 Great for macro. Used it to take closeup shots of eyes. 
8039 4 Awesome charger and batteries. I have the hero 4 black and these batteries work perfect and just as well as the one that came with the camera. The charger charges all 3 at once no problem. Or just 1 or 2 whatever your needs are. Highly reccomend! 
8040 4 Very easy setup and use. Good picture quality. Very happy with my purchase. 
8041 4 Nice 
8042 3 Great batteries to get for great price but those batteries drain little faster than original go pro hero battery. 4.5/5 
8043 0 ended up selling this on craigslist. kept locking up and overheating. made a great doorstop. 
8044 4 Love it! Some of the menu options are a bit hard to understand, and the included manual isn t very helpful, but luckily there are tons of tutorials about every feature online! 
8045 4 Love this works great! 
8046 4 I love Canons. Been using them for years. Love the rebel series. This was/is my first camcorder and got it for family funtions. Great quality!! So compact and ships to you fast! 
8047 1 I bought it for my daughter to play with. The pictures are blurry & grainy. 
8048 3 Perfect fit 
8049 4 Purchased a bunch of these. Really super! Love the new insert to give the &#34;v&#34; groove an option to be flat. Got to see it to understand. 
8050 3 Have not had to use it but glad I purchased it. 
8051 4 Very nice pouch s for my lens.Made very well and looks great too!Well worth the money to protect your valuable lens. 
8052 4 Great product 
8053 4 Great lens. Sharp and cheap! 
8054 4 Perfect size for X100T--but be careful to order the right one from the pull-down menu Installation was easy with no lint or bubbles, and it was even fun thanks to the humorous instructions. 
8055 0 I am sorry I cannot give a review as that item was ordered erroneously and returned. 
8056 4 I just love this camera, ease of use, takes great pictures and video. 
8057 0 very limited usefulness. i threw mine away immediately. 
8058 4 Works perfectly for my go pro and my Sony 4k actioncam Get one. You ll love it 
8059 4 Very good 
8060 4 Extremely clear and bright view. I use this for terrestrial viewing of the beach and mountains and it works amazingly well. I can also see the rings of Saturn with this! This model was a huge upgrade over the entry level Celestron 100mm spotting scope. 
8061 2 Lot s of light for the buck. Still not as user friendly as LED light panels. The green screen is thinner than what i expected and it doesn t all fit into the bag. Give your self lots of time to set up for interview and you should be good. 
8062 4 Quick delivery and great product! 
8063 3 Good camera 
8064 3 Great. Just wished the voice and speaker sound was better. 
8065 0 I had to return right away. Broken right out of the box and VERY flimsy. The neck screw to loosen or tighten the legs was broken as well as one of the legs would not lock into place for the bottom section. 
8066 1 Description said 30 LED would light up, as shown in the picture. The ones received only have one blinking red light. Disappointed in the description. 
8067 4 Nice! good Build quality. 
8068 4 Perfect... 
8069 4 Thanks 
8070 4 worked as advertised. the European adapter is a nice plus. 
8071 4 This tripod is a great value. It is of much higher quality than I was expecting for the price. I bought it to use with my spotting scope and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a low profile tripod to use on your shooting bench. 
8072 3 Fast shipping and exactly as described 
8073 4 Batteries were a perfect addition for my camera. Product as described and love that there is a travel charger included since we re doing a good amount of traveling around Hawaii taking pictures. 
8074 4 Met my needs. Great shipping. 
8075 4 awesome gift for my hubby he loves it 
8076 4 Works well for what it is. A perfect fit for my SoTech Mission Go Bag. 
8077 4 It does what it suppose to do. 
8078 3 Gave me plenty of back up 
8079 4 Works very well. My inital use was to create slides for a presentation. Very happy with this camera. 
8080 2 Good tripod for studio work, but too bulky to carry in the field. 
8081 4 They work just fine. The charger isn t as good as the Panasonic charger, but it works. 
8082 4 Works great and fits perfectly 
8083 3 Great strap for my Fuji XPro1. Really don t use the bag. 
8084 3 Worked great. Nothings perfect, but it works. The stem that goes into battery insert in the camera, seems a little fragile. Handle with care. Overall, good product. Glad I purchased it, lasted a lot longer since I use my 70D for video. 
8085 0 Bought this to replace a lower resolution camera. When I hooked it up, the image was black and white and continually rolled. Sending it back. 
8086 4 Good deal 
8087 4 Great product. Easy to use and setup. 
8088 2 Good 
8089 4 I bought this a while ago, it is still holding a good charge. I have noticed no difference in this vs the Nikon. 
8090 4 Great image quality. You lose one stop but it does a wonderful/clear job extending the range of the lens. 
8091 4 Great macro lens and rounds out a nice set of lens offerings for the e-Mount/A7 series of Sony camera bodies. 
8092 4 Gives you an excellent view with 2x magnification. 
8093 0 Doesn t fit the GoPro 4 
8094 3 I received the go pro lcd + for Father s Day I purchased this after some legwork on Amazon I am very happy with this product and feel confident that my gopro will remain safe and secure even though this is not an exact fit for it 
8095 4 Great little camera. It takes great pictures at night and in low light setting too. 
8096 4 As advertised, on time, works great. 
8097 1 Warning. My Wasabi charger died after approximately one year. The battery works ok. 
8098 4 Package arrived on time and the product is as described. It fits my Cannon 450D. 
8099 4 Works perfectly on my Canon FD 85mm f/1.2 and my Sony A7II. No movement, looks great, and works perfectly! I like to leave the adapters obn the lenses, so I will have to buy another one for my other FD lens. 
8100 4 This binocular has excellent vision. 
8101 4 Great quality batteries. Got these for my gopro hero 4 and they work great. Just as good quality as the gopro batteries at about half the price. Great buy 
8102 4 This is a fabulous product! 
8103 3 The camera is very good. Easy to operate and takes great pics. The added accessory is junk. 
8104 0 It does not fit my 4 Silver. 
8105 3 Just your normal battery charger. Nothing exciting. 
8106 4 Great lens, quality as expected. Great shipper! 
8107 0 I have purchased six Yongnuo flash units in the past and was completely satisfies that I got my monies worth. This is the first unit that I m dissatisfied with. 
8108 4 LOVE! This will probably be my new favorite lens on my D5300!! Excellent photo quality! 
8109 3 Almost all you need to work with an action camera 
8110 0 I have had this replaced three times in the past week. None of them work. Two of the batteries warped upon first use. CHEAPEST PRODUCT EVER DO NOT BUY 
8111 4 Perfect. 
8112 4 I will be in Nepal for 5 weeks trekking and I want enough battery life for my camera. I wish there was a USB charger. 
8113 4 i have used mine for the last ski season on my helmet, am very happy with it. but buy fast sdmc chip for it( high transfer rate) and it works great. Heck of a deal with all the accessories. Isn t a gopro but it also isn t $400 
8114 4 The picture quality is great and the supplied software is easy to use 
8115 3 Loved the camera, accessories where a waste: oversized bag and tripod the holder for the SDs , etc ... prefer accessories that match the product like smaller case, helmet or wrist mounts, etc 
8116 4 like very much 
8117 2 Software for remote viewing frequently stops streaming regardless of signal strength or connection method. Disappointing. 
8118 4 PERFECT and so affordable for such a quality item... THANKS, J 
8119 3 Good little ball head. Nothing amazing, but it works and it s a good deal. 
8120 0 This is not worth the money I spent on it and will be sending it back I and very disappointed with this 
8121 4 Really improved shooting and composing ease but it s just too bulky to fit with the tripod carrying bag. 
8122 4 For some vacation, I do need a affordable and waterproof camera This is everything I need to have a great time with a gopro. Awesome kit That was a funny time. 
8123 3 Good Batteries, better than other brands with higher amp hour. 
8124 4 Prints really clear 
8125 4 Affordable, works, what more can you say! 
8126 4 Solid estructure, very large. Easy to fold and light to carry 
8127 3 Great case for the price why waste your money on a name brand one. 
8128 0 Use it twice never damaged it but it started shutting off by itself I guess the product had it defects 
8129 3 Looks ok 
8130 0 The description should be changed. You cannot get film for this camera. It is useless ! Do not buy! If you want to look at it or collect them then but it. If you want to use it you are out of luck! 
8131 3 These work as stated but if you use large CFL bulbs for photography you need to take caution when screwing them in. The sockets are barely strong enough to support the weight of such larger bulbs. 
8132 3 Easy to install. Easy on and off. Good product 
8133 2 it makes good pictures 
8134 4 yes 
8135 1 The camera its self is great. Great picture and clarity. But the mounting bracket is cheap and doesn t hold the camera, it falls off all the time and even with the instructions it hard to navigate through the setting. 
8136 3 Compact, easy to use, has extra features, and takes great pictures. 
8137 4 It is exactly what I ordered and what I expected 
8138 2 Works as a recorder and video. Hard to tell if it s on or off and no way to tell &#34;what&#34; part of the item being video d is being recorded - for example if you want to record someones face, there s no way to tell if you are. 
8139 4 I love my camera, I m enjoying taking pictures and learning how to use it to get the best quality. 
8140 4 Good for people like to do some sport or some movie free to move 
8141 4 Great tools, it has everything that I need in cleaning my SLR. I m also impressed with the fast delivery. 
8142 4 ok 
8143 4 works as planed 
8144 4 https://youtu.be/2uKrjo2SMuA 
8145 4 Excellent kit, camera takes very clear pictures and works as intended. Great Value. 
8146 4 Great product!!!! 
8147 4 These photography reflectors are awesome!!! I totally recommend them! 
8148 3 It s a great camera pictures are great even when all the way zoomed in they are still pretty good.In low light it s also good all of my low light pictures turn out good. 
8149 4 quality product, arrived quickly. 
8150 3 Exactly what I needed, much longer than the original which is helpful. 
8151 4 Great. 
8152 4 Excellent flash to use. 
8153 4 Extreemly good quality for the price. Almost as good as my Nikons that were twice the price. I would buy them just to have them in the car. 
8154 4 love it worked wonderfully to take family pictures with in combination with the Altura Photo E-TTL Flash Kit for CANON DSLR 
8155 4 This replaced a crappy Walmart special. I m definitely happy with this. It is heavy, so don t plan on backpacking with it. That does make it nice and sturdy though. 
8156 0 Bought last year, was still in unopened package and installed last week. Waited because I was undergoing chemo. Replaced battery, doesn t work at all. After reading multiple other reviews where people received ones that never worked, I would give this item a -1 if I could. 
8157 4 A true 360ws strobe for this price is really a great deal. I tested it and got F22 at 10 , 100ISO...that s a GN of 220 measured in feet.... !!!! I have used it a few times and so far it s held up very well. 
8158 4 This kit is really great!! It makes my pics much focused and wider. The fisheye lens is awesome for panoramic photos. 
8159 1 hoping for aluminum ! 
8160 4 Outstanding quality and function with nice rubber grip and very useful water tight space to store things such as thumbscrews or other GoPro parts. Overall it is a very nice, high quality bobber and worth the small additional cost to gain a better design and useful compartment. 
8161 3 ok 
8162 4 Great product. 
8163 4 I purchased these to use while snorkeling & kayaking. They fit perfectly on disposable waterproof cameras, were comfortable on my wrists and kept the camera afloat when it bounced out of the kayak. 
8164 4 perfect as described 
8165 4 Worked great on a BIG Lab!! 
8166 4 I bought this camera as a beginner camera for me. I love and and am still learning. 
8167 3 Not hard to use at all, simple entry level light meter. This was a great purchase for a photography student like myself, and it fits nicely into the camera bag which is always appreciated. 
8168 4 Martin Powell THIS TECH WAS GREAT UNDERSTOOD HIM. HELP ME OUT ALL THE WAY. I APPRECIATE IT. IRWIN 
8169 4 Received on time as promised and I feel this cap will last longer (not get lost) because of the strap attached to the cap 
8170 4 Really great design. Changes the look of the Sony A7. Usually gets lots of compliments 
8171 4 Works great. Fast delivery 
8172 4 Great buy, versatile, small, but not too, and I use it in the classroom and it is great 
8173 1 The battery and the travel charger are NOT FOR THIS CAMERA! The charger clearly says for a NIKON and the battery is the WRONG SIZE! Do not waste teh extra $20 thinking you are getting a good deal, You are better off buying the extra battery and travel charger elsewhere. 
8174 3 A perfect match and fit. I am very happy with the purchase 
8175 3 I am happy with this purchase, !!! 
8176 3 Great case for the money. Refill foam is available, which is great if you change your usage. Solid hard case. 
8177 3 Works great 
8178 1 Haven t been able to use it as it is missing the top bracket 
8179 4 Pricey, but works as designed and does a great job. 
8180 4 Extremely affordable and you can fit two light for night time shooting. 
8181 4 as advertised, no issues with quality or performance 
8182 4 This is invaluable for setting up a variable focus camera, while you re up on a ladder. It s self-contained and straps to your wrist, and even provides power to the camera so you can view exactly what the camera sees, before you finalize placement. 
8183 1 I am not real enthusiastic about the picture quality. The picture will jump for days on in and then finally stop. Get what you pay for I guess 
8184 4 Great filter for the price! 
8185 4 For the money it can t be beat, purchased as a spare to my Canon 430 speedlite, limited in someways but a great backup and came in quick, just before my vacation. 
8186 4 Really great lights if you are starting out with portrait photography. Great price and they work great. 
8187 4 product is great but delivery by USPS leave a lot to be desired 
8188 4 Correct part and on time delivery 
8189 4 As advertised. Well worth buying refurbished. 
8190 4 Well made. Reasonably priced 
8191 4 This is a great sports cam for the price! Have used it while riding ATV s and in the pool! Takes great pictures and the video is great! Highly recommend this camera! 
8192 4 Great value! Everything works amazingly well for the price. 
8193 4 Very close to OEM batteries, holding a good charge for a reasonable time. 
8194 3 asdf 
8195 4 Works as expected 
8196 3 Worked very well for gift to elderly parents. All they have to do is sit back and watch the photos. Only lacking star as user interface is clunky. And no notification provided to new account that can add photos by email 
8197 4 Works great with my camera! 
8198 4 Love this.. Also purchased the Canopy 2 year protection plan. I just need to know how to get replacement parts. The 4 things on each corner..? Already lost 2 in trees. 
8199 4 Amazing! 
8200 4 Love it 
8201 3 Works good. It could use a better manual. 
8202 4 I am very satisfied with my foscam f19831p. Calls to the support line for setup help has been easy and kenneth is nice and very knowledgeable which made setup very easy. 
8203 4 EXCELLENT...much better than another selfie stick (more expensive) that i purchased last...I lost that one. The Volsey is sturdy, lighter, has rechargable battery and easier to use. Thumbs up!! 
8204 4 Such a wonderful equipment bag. Love the size -- fits under the economy class seat of a 737 (at least it did for me). Great for European travel where they always weigh your carry-on... they don t ask much about this one. 
8205 4 Wife loves this camera. It can make anybody look like a pro. 
8206 4 Just what I needed to protect my new lens! Thanks! 
8207 4 gift 
8208 4 Excellent item, very quick to post, Thanks 
8209 2 It s ok 
8210 4 Just like the original one. Right fit and right feel. 
8211 1 I ordered 1 pair these I think came from California. ..and the were garbage. Very poorly made and didn t last long at all ....the part that came from China was very well made and had a locking ring and screw .... 
8212 0 Cheaply built, sound quality was extremely poor, and I could barely hear the sound. Would not recommend. 
8213 4 Great kit. 
8214 4 Great deal!!!! 
8215 0 Sorry, but this was a piece of junk. It s cheap plastic like a table cloth from the dollar store. It came crushed and wrinkled and I was never able to get the wrinkles out in order to use it. 
8216 4 Excellent quality. Use it to keep my b&w 120 film. 
8217 4 Great!! Product I love this camara, I show the camara to one of my friends and like it and he got one to... 
8218 3 Works best for skin response. Works fine but instructions are hard to understand. .and even locate oniine.. 
8219 2 It s so nice to have this and it works pretty good. My only complaint is that the range isn t very far so it defeats the purpose of using it. 
8220 0 Camera uses unusual means of releasing the shutter. There is a ring outboard of the zoom ring, that must be pressed just right to release the shutter. My technicians had great difficulty getting the shutter to release on several occasions. 
8221 2 Far too overpriced 
8222 4 Haven t had this much fun since i bought my first motorcycle. Love this thing, easy to fly, almost addictive. 
8223 4 Super 
8224 4 Excellent value. 
8225 4 I used this camera and the quality is really good. I would definitely recommend this 
8226 4 Really love this bag. The sections in it are so helpful! 
8227 2 Got this as a present for a friend! She said the pictures may come out dark in too much sunlight 
8228 3 Great Product 
8229 4 Got this for a customer who misplaced their older-style / 1st generation USB cable to download photos from camera. Works as advertised. 
8230 4 Great series of reflectors. I love the shear scrim. Caveat: Almost impossible to fold up. Really! 
8231 4 Small form factor but great performance. Always missed out on a flash for fuji for covering small functions. 
8232 3 Great gift I gave my dad. The only thing is the tripod is a bit smaller than expected. Like that every fits in the case! 
8233 4 Great lights for close up filming and they work really well in low light outdoor areas. However you must make sure your camcorder matches with this brand of lights because it comes with a shoe mount you need to screw into specific sony model cameras. 
8234 4 I use my camera every weekend and did not notice that this shield was even on. Easy application and does not distort the screen. 
8235 4 had to write a review.... camera is fantastic! really easy to set up... great job 
8236 3 Good, thanks so much 
8237 4 have not realy used yet but what I did try worked fine 
8238 0 I just got the chance to try it right now. it is cheap material product, it s broke right away. 
8239 4 Solid Construction, threads very easily on several different lenses, from L series to non L glass. Perfect amount of drag on the rotation of the filter. eliminates guesswork. Color Cast?? NONE I could find. Solid piece of gear. Has replaced my Tiffen CPLs for good! 
8240 3 Batteries delivered very quickly and as described. Work well in my Nikon D5200 camera. Price was great for two. 
8241 4 very nice to replace all the adapters into one unit. 
8242 0 This is not working after a week! 
8243 4 Very nice and tidy, fits well for sony nex 
8244 4 Used for over 5000 pictures in two weeks. Worked great on my RX100iii. 
8245 4 Used to complete my camera system 
8246 4 worked great until transmitter went bad 
8247 4 Fit perfect and git fast 
8248 3 Received cables in a timely manner ( thank you ) replaced it with my 4 camera splitter and have no problems still. 
8249 4 Good and fast delivery and the productWorks and looks good 
8250 4 Was delivered when they said it would be lots of extras for a great price 
8251 2 *** Star 
8252 4 Works great. No problem with filters either... even a polarizer. 
8253 4 It s very good 
8254 4 This item is really great, and a good value! 
8255 3 love the space perfect size. Tight to work with, getting in and out. stiff zipper. hope it will soften with use. 
8256 4 Excellent Tripod! ! Would always buy it again. Next time I would get the taller tripod So sturdy. It does anything. Love it! 
8257 4 Good for the price. Quality are beyond expectation. 
8258 2 no tan bueno 
8259 3 It does exactly what is suppose to, not to mention it s pretty sleek. 
8260 4 Everything was just fine!! Charged batteries & tested perfect In my S50 Cannon camera!! 
8261 1 One camera was missing the antenna 
8262 4 Works well, no humming, good for multiple long exposures 
8263 4 Gave this a bday gift and daughter loves it. A bit pricey having to constantly purchase film but it s to be expected. Nice shade of blue and works exactly as it should. 
8264 4 Working fine. 
8265 3 Accidentally threw out the original charger for my camera so I had to buy this one. It works well so far. 
8266 3 While it is cheaper that the Nikon version, and has an internal battery which is nice, it is bulky. 
8267 0 I m a big Rokinon fan as I own the 85mm and the 135mm. This is probably the worse glass I ve ever owned. 
8268 1 It s a Micro USB charger. Nothing more. 
8269 3 Worked well! 
8270 4 Amazing! So many possibilities. 
8271 3 2nd one I bought. I think the bag that it comes in has gotten a little better quality 
8272 4 really its exellent and the photo very sharp thanks alot for 
8273 4 Yep, they re batteries. Work as advertised, and last longer than the one that came with the Fuji X100T. 
8274 1 Great concept, but it wouldn t velcro around my hands any way i tried. I may have had a defective one but i had to return it. Seemed like the velcro was in the wrong place. 
8275 3 These are adequate. Not as thin as the better pieces, but does the job. Good value. 
8276 4 It s great! up to now I have used it 3 times, with no issue. easy to connect and install. 
8277 0 The harness broke tge first time we put it on. Cheap! 
8278 4 great starter kit 
8279 4 Awesome kit for my Nikon D3100! Arrived quickly and already having fun with this kit and my new lense! Allows everyday people to take more professional shots with any camera! Very happy with this purchase! 
8280 2 Poor optical quality. Lot of purple fringing and image softness. Heavy and prone to lot of image shake due to high magnification.Returned and would not buy again. 
8281 0 junk 
8282 4 Item came in well protected and completely new. It was adequate for me to keep my dive mask and offer really good protection to my mask 
8283 0 They have great instructional videos n the product is easy to manipulate however, due to flimsy materials used it does not function as advertised. Expected stronger parts...seems like a $25 product instead. 
8284 4 Awesome Unit. Not phantom so only use with your powered mics before going into camera. 
8285 0 It is not what I expected but my granddaughter is having fun using them 
8286 4 Its totally working for me. Charging my D90 Battery like a charm. 
8287 1 Klugy, but it works. 
8288 4 Good stuff at a reasonable price. 
8289 4 The flip up eye piece is what makes this camera worth having. An absolute must for outdoor sunny days, and while zooming in on far away objects. 
8290 4 Perfect 
8291 0 Received broken. Very cheap quality. Is more a toy. 
8292 4 This was everything I expected and more. Absolutely love it.. 
8293 4 Good camera and even though it was refurbished it is in great condition. 
8294 1 Almost all the photos I took came out blurry, and I did follow the directions and made sure I was within 3 feet of the subject, etc. Disappointed. 
8295 4 This camera is better than my friend s GoPro! After I showed him my camera, he got one as well. 
8296 3 This camera has a nice clear picture. 
8297 3 You can never have too many mounts for your Go Pro. 
8298 4 lots of room fits canon t3 , 75-250, 35-55 lens, extra batteries, cone, point and shot, flash, lots more room 
8299 4 Nice 
8300 4 Works well 
8301 3 I have used this camera for the last 3 weeks in a Swimming Pool and at the Sea and It works great!! 
8302 4 Speedy delivery is always a plus and can I use the same UV filter on the zoom (300mm), part of my camera also? I am very happy with this one, easy for this lady who loves taking her action pix. Thank you 
8303 4 I love this! 
8304 4 Unfortunately there was something wrong with the camcorder upon arrival. We got in touch with Vivitar and they replaced it with a newer model. Great customer support! 
8305 4 Great stuff. 
8306 2 Use it only a few times.Hands should be steady to get clear pictures. 
8307 4 Best $$ I ever spent. This is really a good product. I was in Bermuda recently and I was able to take a lot of beautiful pictures under the sea!! I love it. I used it for my Canon Powershot S95. 
8308 2 Does the job but you have to tighten really hard so it does not come out and wiggle loose.. Good grip and cheap for the cost. Shipping came in whenever it wanted. It said 3-4 weeks but it came in 1.5 weeks without warning. Just showed up... haha China, man... 
8309 4 Love this lens and is on my camera most of the time. I particularly like the constant bigger f number in this lens. 
8310 2 Works but did not impress me too much...makes hardly a change in the picture 
8311 4 This thing is so sweet! Very agile, quick, and reaponsive. This puppy is so fun to fly! A great quad to learn the basics with. 
8312 4 I like it! 
8313 4 great value, works as advertised 
8314 4 So handy! 
8315 3 Helps extend recording time on the device without too much added mass. The small batteries in the GoPro Hero 4 are a joke so you really need to get this if you are planning to record for any length of time. 
8316 1 Good bundle. 
8317 2 Good Camera 
8318 4 Great buy 
8319 4 great 
8320 4 Works excellent. Fits perfectly on an HO flat car to make videos on model railroad as if riding on train. 
8321 4 Thanks everything was good!!! 
8322 4 We are very pleased and may buy another of the same. 
8323 3 Last a little longer than the stock battery. 
8324 4 it s very nice 
8325 4 An amazingly versatile lens. Easy to use in just about any situation. I ve only just scratched the surface of its capabilities and not come close to its limits. Except when I m going super-wide (and then I love my 10-24), this sits on the camera (70D) 
8326 3 Where can I get info on how to program this device? 
8327 4 Fits perfect, light and strong material. 
8328 4 Camera fits great in it and with the padding it stays safe! 
8329 4 Its a lenshood - not much function :-). It has a quality feel. 
8330 4 Perfect kit for maintaining lenses. Magic fiber is really nice for cleaning all glass 
8331 4 very good camera, installed and work better than the others, have purchsed more. 
8332 4 Product has met my expectations and great quality for such an affordable price! Package came in great condition and received it in 2 days. Very satisfied with their services. 
8333 4 Excellent 
8334 4 Charger works with my Canon T1i battery. Came in a small box and looks like the charger pictured. Haven t tried to use it in the car, but that should be a nice option. 
8335 4 Great camera. Easy to install, good quality and small enough to hide when needed. Great product! 
8336 3 Pretty good camera! 
8337 1 Did not work on my Canon Flash. 
8338 4 Best value for the money. 
8339 4 After doing a boatload of research on rear view cameras I decided to purchase the rear view safety camera. It has lived up to its reputation. Installation was a snap and I couldn t be happier with the performance. 
8340 0 The neck broke on the second use... Very cheap plastic. 
8341 4 Very sharp, very good quality. Great build quality. I would say much better than the Canon alternative. 
8342 4 Make sure to get the extra batteries as just having one in there is a waste. It adds bulk but feels good in the hand when flipping for a portrait shot. Its worth paying a little bit more for the official Canon grip instead of the other branded ones. 
8343 4 Works great! no issues with battery life after 3 weeks 
8344 4 Just love the product, worked out great. A+++ 
8345 1 This product is not as it appears in the ad. It is an ordinary, round mirror; so don t imagine an oval that fits our small, rear view mirrors. Fooled me with the picture. If you want a little, round mirror, shop locally. 
8346 4 Carl was VERY helpful in assisting me in activating my FOSCAM camera. Thank you. 
8347 4 Worked perfect, good quality 
8348 4 works 
8349 4 I love this bag. Well made. 
8350 4 Arrived in ecellent condition. 
8351 4 Great price.....fits well. 
8352 2 I didn t go through all of it s features. My Samsung phone takes less grainy photos. The zoom was the only advantage, and wasn t worth the extra expense. If I want zoom, I ll buy a film camera. 
8353 2 Works great with my Flash unit and is very adaptable to my needs: However, After only two uses the tension in the umbrella caused two of the prongs to bend. Though the everything works, the umbrella is slightly off and is no longer symmetric. 
8354 4 Excellent tripod and holder. 
8355 4 Great price. 
8356 4 I love bringing this camera when I go to Disney! The pictures come out so good! I recommend taking outdoor shots when the sky is clear for a more &#34;enhanced&#34; shot. 
8357 3 The t5i is a great camera. Nice features and no issues with it yet. I bought the bundle primarily for the extra lens and included SD card. The case, tripod, wide angle lens, and filters are passable but not great. The value of this set is worth the price. 
8358 4 The sling shoulder neck strap makes it much easier to pull the camera into position. It realigns the pressure points away from the neck spine and reduces pressure on the muscles of the neck. This is especially helpful for photographers with arthritic spinal changes associated with aging. 
8359 4 Great device. Easy to install and even easier to use. Just set it and forget it. Very good quality pics. 
8360 4 I love this camera!!! Exactly what I wanted! The night vision is so clear and I love being able to move the camera by touching the screen of the device I m using. 
8361 4 Good item. Sturdy. Worth every money you paid for. 
8362 4 Very light and powerful. Worked well in Alaska 
8363 0 Charger didn t last a week and batteries won t keep a charGe 
8364 1 wouldn t recommend due to vignetting showing up on videos. 
8365 4 Very good video! 
8366 4 These are beautiful original DJI Props. these are not the cheap knockoffs from other listings. you get what you pay for .Make sure if you are flying you are using OEM parts to guarantee you don t crash your quad from inferior parts. 
8367 4 Fits perfectly. Perfection in workmanship and material. All greatness! 
8368 4 Great camera and user friendly....takes great pictures 
8369 4 perfect gift for birthday give along with new insant camera. 
8370 4 Great deal for me-use for astronomy and birding. Field of view is a little narrow but that s to be expected compared to the Fuji 10x50 s and Pentax 7x50 s I use also. Good colors and it s made in Japan too. 
8371 4 Camera works great, arrived on time and as advertised, the lens on this camera is so much better than my last digital camera. 
8372 4 Awesome product,quick delivery, and great support 
8373 4 It work perfectly. I Hava bought other kid of before but definitely this one for much is the best. I love it. 
8374 4 I totally love these lights. Nice and bright and the ability to manipulate between incandescent and daylight gives a creator loads of options for setting up a shot. 
8375 0 I have to return them because it was impossible for me to contact customer services. Even though it was easy to install it, there were steps I needed to be guided through, and I couldn t get the help to go through it. 
8376 3 It works well for the money. The charge was a little less than I had hoped for. 
8377 4 Love it thank youuuu 
8378 4 I ve had no problems with the batteries or the charger. This should be standard for any GoPro user. Highly recommend. 
8379 4 Works perfectly to replace sensors zapped by lightning. Easy to install. 
8380 3 Fairly good for the price! Sometimes it takes a little bit to take the pictures but then once it finally connects works good! Perfect for a beginner. 
8381 4 Good products 
8382 0 I did not receive a Kodak battery. I received a Halcyon battery, which would not recharge. Since I ve misplaced the receipt, I can t return it. I have purchased a Radio Shack battery instead of trying to order one again. 
8383 4 Mounts and works very well 
8384 4 Excellent photo quality. Excellent build and feel. Excellent WiFi features. I bought this primarily to take pictures of Coins and it definitely took some outstanding pictures. WiFi Direct Transfer to PC was a breeze. Saved me a fortune of time. 
8385 3 Product works as advertised. 
8386 4 everything was ok. Thank you! 
8387 4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0ay8zAY_Jw This is how we used it and it worked great for us I love everything about it and it is so durable and easy to work with. 
8388 4 This camera is exceptional. It is very similar to my GoPro, for a fraction of the price. I would highly recommend this cost effective alternative, especially if you are investing in a GoPro like device for the first time. 
8389 1 The ad claims that the fp100c works in the SX70 camera but the plastic case is too large to fit in the camera. 
8390 3 Perfect product, great price. Not too big to take on outings and it is durable. Plenty of storage. Highly recommended! 
8391 4 Excelente cámara ..delivery rapido 
8392 2 good 
8393 4 Very comfortable for extended use. Quality is very good. 
8394 4 I like the handle best, because it does float. The handle allows you to properly aim and shoot shots in all conditions. 
8395 4 This little camera is amazing for the money! very easy to use and has awsome picture quality! 
8396 4 Solid build quality and protected all my gear after falling out of a car! 
8397 4 I love the product! 
8398 4 Great product. Works great 
8399 3 Works well for carrying our Sony HandyCam and accessories. Not a lot of extra room, but probably enough. Seems to be quality-made and should last. 
8400 0 in day time is perfect but in night cant see anything i not return because is really difficult take it off but i don t recommend to no body 
8401 3 Item arrived on time. I m happy with this product 
8402 4 Battery works great! Fraction of the cost from Manufacturer. 
8403 4 Hi,thanks for sending to me the thing that i ordered,i love it./. 
8404 4 Meets all expectations 
8405 1 I returned this item as it does what it says but there is noticeable signal loss and distortion. 
8406 4 Worked as a perfect replacement battery for my Cannon Vixia HF R10 digital camcorder. Have been using for about 6 months and the battery has kept a charge way better than the battery that came with the camera. I recommend. 
8407 4 I couldn t be happier with this telescope. it is my first ever telescope, and i have had many amazing nights on my back porch with this thing. 
8408 2 I ll prefer regular foam over this stuff next time. But, overall this is pretty decent foam far as quality. 
8409 3 Very good softbox, great price! 
8410 4 👍 
8411 3 Battery dead in 45 min. 
8412 4 Lowepro makes the best lens cases around. I have this case in several different sizes. Not only do they protect the lens like no other, but they also look and feel great too. 
8413 4 This little stand does the trick. I have used it several time to give presentations to the Rotary Club. 
8414 4 Really bright light and goes right on my tripod with ease 
8415 1 This selfie stick is really nice but it broke on me the third time I used it. The middle piece broke off and I could not salvage it and had to throw it away. It also took the longest time to sync with my iPhone. 
8416 4 I ordered this lens hood for use with my macro lens. Works great. Be sure to check the thread size of the lens you would like to use it with before ordering. I ordered the 49 mm thread size and it fits my lens perfectly. 
8417 4 Works perfectly, just what I needed 
8418 4 Works fantastic. Couldn t find locally and wanted it for vacation! Solution? Order thru Amazon and it ll be there when you get there!! &#60;3. #dottiedixon 
8419 4 Product was just as discribed 
8420 4 Great service and prompt delivery! Thanks a bunch!! A+ 
8421 4 Sturdy doors with secure latch. Just right for making access to space under RV dinette seats. The only improvement I suggest is to include a template with it for cutting the hole. 
8422 4 I just got a Canon G3-X with external EVF, and I needed a case that would fit it. This one works perfectly, plus there is room in the front packet for the charger and other accessories. Great case! 
8423 2 ITS OK 
8424 4 Magic fiber is amazing at cleaning glass. I keep some in my car, my husbands car, my camera bag, my desk office. It s so handy 
8425 4 Excellent product. I lost my original Sony charger along with the original battery. This is quite an excellent replacement. Feels like it charges much quicker than the original charger. The cigarette lighter charger comes in really handy. Overall, very satisfied. 
8426 4 Great value for a set of four. My SIL loves her little polaroid and this film is really cute. I would buy this for her again. 
8427 4 Amazing fit 
8428 4 Hoy glass is top notch. If you re a pro, and you re using high quality lenses, don t put a plastic filter over them and soften up your image. Just bite the bullet, spend the extra money, and get a filter you can be proud of. 
8429 4 Works as intended. Love the colors, hard to miss! 
8430 3 decent 
8431 4 EXCELENTE 
8432 4 Makes charging quick and easy. 
8433 4 High quality product in individual plastic envelopes. Excellent performance. Couldn t be happier. 
8434 4 This copter is so light when it crashes nothing happens. It is loads of fun and easy to fly 
8435 4 Love it! Works great at a great price. 
8436 3 Need to firmly tight...even after tight...it gets loose...so need to find the right position to place this arm and supporting device... 
8437 3 Very handy and everything I expected. 
8438 4 Excellent 
8439 0 parts where missing 
8440 4 I love it but its not water proof 
8441 3 I have a small camera that I travel with and it fits in this case very snugly. It seems to be enough protection while in my luggage, from clanging into other hard surfaces. 
8442 4 Just as advertised. Everything was brand new in its original packaging and it all works properly. 
8443 4 Nice 
8444 3 I ve learned a lot about my camera. 
8445 4 As expected 
8446 4 awesome item 
8447 4 The photos are very clear and sharp - excellent lens. 
8448 3 as described... work well 
8449 3 Very nice camera, but needed a memory card. This was a separate purchase and delayed camera use. 
8450 4 Arrived on time and everything was in great condition. The lens and flash just didn t work for me. 
8451 4 Just an FYI: I checked each item in the package to see what each would cost separately. I only searched on Amazon. The total came to $1297 - without the bag; the description here is too vague to match it. 
8452 4 Nice 
8453 4 really GOOD DVR FOR THIS MONEY 
8454 4 Love love love this!!! Nice price, great product, easy to use. 
8455 3 I love the camera but it is missing a very important attachment piece. I can t use any attachments because one screw is missing. 
8456 2 As long as you re on a flat surface it works perfectly. I wouldn t recommend usage on carpet or any rough terrain. 
8457 4 Great deal..look very professional. 
8458 4 great deal, not sure why so many others are selling the same kit for $50 more, oh well 
8459 4 Only thing is I thought it would be assorted but they are all one design. 
8460 4 Love love love!!! 
8461 4 B 
8462 3 Good price, I think the quality of the picture are fair. I was very happy with the results. 
8463 4 Nice 
8464 4 Bought this for my new Canon camera. Hold a charge well. 
8465 4 Absolutely love this and for the price and all I will have to do is remember to take batteries! 
8466 4 Operates as described and expected. Excellent zoom. 
8467 4 Seller was very good to work with. I was very pleased with my purchase. 
8468 3 I like it 
8469 3 Comfortable sturdy strap but hard to get used to how my camera hangs. 
8470 4 Did what I bought it for 
8471 4 This seems to work as good as the original that came with the Nikon 1. It is quite compact and came quickly when we forgot our original charger on a trip. 
8472 4 They worked great and even lasted longer then the go pro battery! 
8473 4 Just what I needed and a great price 
8474 4 Bought this to use with my Nikon D5500 DSLR. Works perfect! 
8475 4 Well made, comfortable on the wrist. Detachable clip makes this even handier. Love the design too. I ve also been using Optech s larger model wrist strap on my Mirrorless Fuji X-T1 on three trips, and their products are very well made and the most comfortable straps around. 
8476 4 Well made and works perfectly. 
8477 1 Works ok. But will not connect to wifi 
8478 4 great product 
8479 1 Has a defect. A line straight across. I ll keep it only because I got it on a great deal. 
8480 3 Great camera but far too complicated for a 73 year old man such as me. 
8481 4 VERY GOOD 
8482 4 Item delivered on time, was as described and a very nice product, packed good would rate A+ all the way ! 
8483 4 Great addition to adjust white balance which everyone should know how to do. Folds nicely to fit in any bag. 
8484 4 Love it, takes great pics. 
8485 4 Nice mount fits the camera perfectly. 
8486 4 great. 
8487 4 Great camera case! I love the color (brown leather). It is so fashionable. 
8488 4 I lost my original lens cap somewhere in Yosemite! This is exactly like my original and I received it quickly. 
8489 4 good 
8490 0 Don t waste your money on this battery grip for the Sony a6000. It is a piece of junk. 
8491 4 I have not found a better charger for the price n 
8492 3 The adapter ring does not come with the filter retaining ring so another adapter ring has to be used to hold the filter on the camera lens. It holds the filter on the camera lens as per it s purpose. 
8493 1 It s just a not good product. It s cheap to the touch. 
8494 4 Perfect accessory for any lense 
8495 4 I love this lens. Fast shipment. Thanks 
8496 4 Great 
8497 4 I ve tried this out alot and i really like it. the quality is really nice , both the 720p and 1080p. Learning how to use it is incredibly easy and painless. I got this is as a promotion for a review. 
8498 2 I like the item but when I received it and tried putting it together, the stick will not screw into the part that holds the phone. I cannot use this item. 
8499 0 What a joke! No way to save your videos to a PC. The only option is to use THEIR cloud storage for $99/year MORE! No thanks as they SHOULD allow US to save OUR videos! JOKE RIP OFF PRODUCT!!! 
8500 4 Reasonably priced, items as described, arrived when promised. Seller recommended. 
8501 0 The instructions are terrible. We still can t figure how to make it work!! 
8502 4 This is just awesome! I will definitely recommend it! Very satisfied :-) 
8503 4 Used this mount to record a few videos while I was driving and it did a really good job. It s solid and worked great on the dashboard and the windshield. If you re looking to make mobile videos, don t look past this mount. 
8504 4 My mother in law requested this for her birthday to store her new Nikon camera and all of its accouterments. It holds everything and is a reasonable size. Plus, the backpack style is much easier to tote around than the shoulder strap version of old. 
8505 4 Everything works well. There are a few places some of the plastic fittings aren t perfectly smooth, but you re paying $25 for a ton of parts. 
8506 4 Works perfect 
8507 4 I am loving this camera!! I got this to upgrade from my T2i and I am very impressed. Pictures are really clear and great. The camera is bigger but I m getting used to it. I am very happy I went with this one. :) 
8508 4 Products are the same quality as the originals. However, these come at a very affordable price that everyone can afford. Wouldn t hesitate to buy again if i get another gopro. 
8509 3 pretty good camera 
8510 0 This was advertised a product with the Canon camera I purchased so I wrongly thought it would fit the camera and it doesn t. Much too small for the camera I bought so it is useless to me 
8511 4 Very cool for it to geotag the pictures taken. I love it! 
8512 3 The hood is OK. But when removing from camera it comes off together with the protective lens. 
8513 4 I really love my Rode VideoMic I shot a whole documentary using this microphone. I am thinking about upgrading to the pro anyone want to buy my gently used Mic?! Lol all jokes aside, this is a wonderful microphone and makes a big difference when you use it 
8514 4 Even though the original battery seems to last forever (next to no moving parts on the camera), it is always good to have a backup battery. This one is indistinguishable from the original battery, and works great. 
8515 3 I used the narrative to clip to capture moments with my family all over Japan and came back with many deeply satisfyingly memories that I couldn t have preserved any other way. 
8516 4 Best cheap LEDs 
8517 4 Excellent product - very pleased with it. 
8518 4 Love this camera backpack. Recommend it to everyone I meet. Perfect for traveling. 
8519 4 I use the MeFoto with my Canon 5D Mark III. Love it! (Fits nicely in my Packsack ) 
8520 4 Quite remarkable for the price. 
8521 4 very good day or night, also good price. this is my fourth dash cam .this one i like the best. but the question is, how long will it last? 
8522 4 It is excellent, 
8523 4 Life saver for me. Eliminated worries about my elderly mother getting out of bed at night with me knowing. 
8524 4 Perfect screen protection. Fits well and recommend you use it right out of the gate to protect the screen. 
8525 4 Meets my needs at the lowest price available. 
8526 4 From what I can tell, it is a real Fuji battery and powers the camera for the same length of time. We got this as a spare for when we are in the field for an extended period. Works fine. 
8527 4 excellent 
8528 4 Just as advertised 
8529 4 Lightweight, compact. Takes great pictures. 
8530 3 Battery 
8531 4 Does the job and great value for the price!! would recommend... 
8532 3 Very nice! just was what i needed. it is made well and works to keep all the parts in one place. thank you! 
8533 1 Doesn t seem very secure even as tight as possible. Getting a bit of shake from the joint on the clam shell to the arm. 
8534 3 The only problem was the host of extra charges that added over 15% to the first cost of $74.99 so that the total first cost to me was really $87.23. 
8535 0 The worse tripod I have seen. Too short, not strong, looks like kids tripod. I returned it. 
8536 3 The only complaint is that the lens hood is very loose. The lens is wide and sharp. 
8537 4 This case provides good protection for the camera. 
8538 4 works great 
8539 4 This camera meets & exceeds my expectations of a point & shoot camera. 
8540 4 Easy to use.. Just plug it into the wall.. Didnt ruin my battery. 
8541 4 Everything was good. 
8542 1 The camera worked ok but upon playback the colors were washed out, no matter what settings I had it on. Returned 
8543 0 I agree. Not plug and play. And even after figuring out the setup I never could get my NVR to recognize it. 
8544 4 the Falcon works fine I m very satisfied with this product 
8545 4 GOOD PRODUCT ! 
8546 4 muy bueno exelente 
8547 4 No heavy, easy to wear, nice. It great For the drome. 
8548 4 These work perfect for my small LED lights and Strobes. I have 6 of them and use them all the time :) 
8549 4 Nice. Handy size, neutral color, good texture for most any fine or delicate work. I m using it for guitar maintenance, but I may get another one for greasy/oily stuff, cars, bikes, guns; this is a handy product at a reasonable price. Beats using a yoga mat... 
8550 4 Definitely exceeds my expectations, this Nikon D5500 is a great camera, I am very happy, easy to handle specially for novice like me. 
8551 4 Happy with the product, does what I intended it to do! Love that you can string the cap to camera for easy impromptu photos! 
8552 4 Good 
8553 4 Simple to operate, easy to transport, the price was great. A good second camera to my SLR 
8554 4 Bought this for my Lumix DMC-GM5 camera and glad I did...grip is firm and secure and makes holding the camera that much more comfortable. My wife liked it so much she took it for her GM5...so now I have had to order a second one for myself!!! 
8555 4 very happy ...fast delivery...ready to use.. 
8556 4 Easy point and shoot, quality product. Gone are the days when I photographed with all Nikon film equipment. Easy to slip in your pocket and with a 32 gig memory stick you can take a years worth of pics. 
8557 4 Looks great on my mantle with 3 5x7 pictures from my granddaughter s wedding. I previously bought a similar frame that was too big for my space which was returned. This one shows off the pictures and is compact and beautifully made. 
8558 4 I have several Fotodiox adapters and they all fit perfectly, and so far they all allow focus to infinity. This one actually will focus past infinity. That isn t a big problem but you do have to actually focus at infinity. 
8559 2 Fits well, Looks good, Camera resolution NOT crisp. Prying out the old led bar and installing it in the camera unit was a little challenging. It gets the job done, and I like the position of the camera. If the image was more crisp it would be 4 stars easy. 
8560 4 Works great, easy to install 
8561 0 Did not work seems like not charged even after plugging in. 
8562 4 I purchased this and it works just fine. Found that I hardly use it though. 
8563 4 Great buy 
8564 0 Piece of junk! Battery lasts 10 minutes! Useless piece of equipment! Do not waste your money! 
8565 1 This lens had a bubble Cant make a difference in photography, but looks defective. 
8566 4 good , fast shipping , that s great :) 
8567 4 They are for spares. 
8568 4 I loved this product bc it griped on my iPhone and did not fall.Aslo the selfie stick can adjust to your phone size. I have not seen no flaws yet.my rating is a five star. 
8569 2 If you re looking for a cheap tripod- well. here it is. Construction is a little flimsy, all plastic. It s alright but I d suggest just to have light loads on this one. 
8570 4 good film 
8571 1 very poor quality lens filter coloring on the glass was uneven when they arrived and the threads did not match up to the lens very well at all. 
8572 4 Good for a back-up. Not as well made as am original. But does work. 
8573 4 Excellent value, responsive and easy to fly. First drone I ve owned and will buy the XW8 FPV next. It s also great fun to do with you family. 
8574 0 Doesn t work. The gimbal catches 
8575 4 Love the quality of the pics and the range you get with this lens is amazing 
8576 4 Amazing. It has all I was looking for in a product like this. Very recommendable. 
8577 4 received as advertised but have not yet received my stand 
8578 3 AMAZING for the price. I mean it, you won t find a better reflector out there for this price 
8579 3 These work fine and the car charger is very convenient. However, they last about half as long as the original camera battery. It s not a big deal if you always have a spare fully charged battery, but carrying multiple batteries around on vacation gets tiresome. 
8580 4 Good quality, very relaible 
8581 4 Had a back room area in our office that frequently had staff during auto-arm times. This let the staff know the alarm was auto-arming. Easy to install. small form factor. very pleased. 
8582 4 It s a lens cap. Does what lens caps do! 
8583 3 It s a battery 
8584 4 We are using this camera everyday on our trip to Europe and it is easy to use and the pictures are wonderful. 
8585 4 Great product! Fast shipping!! 
8586 0 Stand was broken when I got it, completely useless 
8587 0 The mini usb port have 10 pins and doesn t work with most of the cameras. 
8588 4 Needed a cheap waterproof camera for vacation and this sufficed more than well enough. 
8589 3 excellent product, arrived on time, works great. i would purchase from this merchant again.very happy with this product, would recommend it to friends. 
8590 4 Great little lens. Used it a lot and it is made very well. 
8591 4 great camera for the price 
8592 4 Great seller, fast shipping, good product, thank you. 
8593 4 Works like a Nikon coolpix should 😏 
8594 4 With this I seldom need a lens cap. Works great. 
8595 3 Fine product fair price 
8596 4 Everything I expected! 
8597 4 Works great to replace original lens cap. 
8598 4 Came on time and intact. Very fast and power quadcopter. Will buy again. 
8599 1 I can t write about the function of the product except that I was not able to use it for my purpose. 
8600 4 Works Great! 
8601 4 Great easy to use 
8602 4 Makes a PEN into a pocket camera. 
8603 3 Fits pretty good. No hanging edges of the ends of the screen so the cover won t pill off easily. 
8604 0 Disappointed worked but didn t switch from day to night for reading plates had to climb post each morning and evening to change setting. Ended up buying different camera will find a use for this one somewhere else or resale 
8605 4 This was exactly what I needed and was afraid I would never find. Thanks!!! 
8606 3 Very nice ! 
8607 3 good quality and both the car and home chargers are handy. 
8608 0 The worst I have ever bought. 
8609 4 Nice worth the money would buy it again 
8610 4 Very Pleased with this item 
8611 4 Just what I needed the Nikon D5500 does not provide the Hot Shoe which is sad since you pay so much for the camera. 
8612 4 Works great with my Canon600EX 
8613 4 The pen is great, it takes clear pictures and great 720p videos. Over all a great pen. 
8614 1 I could never get the cameras to work while i was away from home. Hired professionals to connect the cameras -no luck. Planning on returning all items. 
8615 4 Has its tiny flaws, but does the job. 
8616 1 too bulky 
8617 4 Great quality - thank you! 
8618 4 gave as part of gift bag for someone with new Go Pro and they loved it! 
8619 4 Quick charging, great price, a little inconvenient that charger plugs directly into power point with no lead/cable, but great that you can also charge in the car. 
8620 4 Works as you would expect it to for a reasonable price 
8621 2 Great pictures but the video don t work good. 
8622 4 It is a good camera, nice pictures 
8623 4 great quality 
8624 4 It s a GoPro BacPac that as indicated gives you the extra time needed. Easily attaches the camera and extends the life almost twice of the battery. Fits perfectly into the extended housing and easily charged. I purchased two and glad that I did! 
8625 3 Charged up nice. No problems! 
8626 4 It is extremely convenient for me to be able to see the comings and goings of employees,lots of functions I`m interested in just like timely recording,motion detection alarm,night vision,PTZ curise etc. 
8627 0 we are trouble with Nest on the phone have to use pass word every time I want to see it It is not user friendly for use. would like to talk to someone about it. please help. 
8628 4 working as intended 
8629 3 Really helps with underwater color. Stayed on the camera without a problem. Cotton safety string that catches lens in case the lens falls off the camera is flimsy and broke quickly. Will need to replace with nylon fishing line. 
8630 4 How do you love a charger? The merchandise is working fine. What I needed. 
8631 1 I had to return twice because two of the three lenses did not fit the camera. 
8632 4 Great to have spare; works great. 
8633 4 very good 
8634 4 good product 
8635 0 Camera is decent but the software is flat terrible....Sucks to setup and is also awful at motion detection.....It alerts for flies and bees but doesn t do anything with the person doing jumping jacks in my driveway. FAIL 
8636 4 I use this with a Vivitar 85mm 1.4 lens on my Sony A7ii. Works perfectly. I m getting another one for my 35mm manual focus lens just so I don t have to switch one out all the time. 
8637 4 Sick!! Works good 
8638 4 Fit perfectly. 
8639 4 We were able to see our home beautifully while on safari in South Africa - amazing! 
8640 4 Very bright! Love that you can change the warmth and the dial down the brightness. Takes a ton of batteries (AA), but to be expected. At full brightness, mine lasted about 2 hours. Great for fill light in photography. 
8641 3 Good quality 
8642 4 Sturdy and compact, everything I wished for. 
8643 4 Bought two for kayaking to keep cell phone in, they work great had for about a year now. 
8644 4 Works great. 
8645 4 Thanks 
8646 4 Arrived on time and is a good value. 
8647 3 It s a good starter to get you used to your GoPro and a lot of the accessories. Would definitely be considering upgrading after you have gotten use to them. 
8648 4 I love this camera. This package deal was a great starter kit. 
8649 4 Very visible on water and helps floating the camera its attached to. 
8650 4 Just what I wanted 
8651 4 Who need s a Gopro 
8652 4 Very good camera, it works great and very easy to learn to use. Takes very good pictures and it takes them fast. 
8653 3 Fits!!! 
8654 3 works well and secure all though sits a little low but works ok. Thanks! 
8655 3 It installs and operates quickly and without issues. The jumper to set the sensitivity is explained well. One thing I noticed, it does not seem to act as a repeater for the Z-wave signal. Is there a way to force it into repeater mode? 
8656 0 Missing item. I don t have the stand. 
8657 4 Very good overall experience. Easy purchase, fast delivery. Would recommend. 
8658 4 great extra battery 
8659 4 Not as strong as the GoPro branded mount. This is more like a mount for GPS or car-smartphone holder, but for mounting a action camera to a smooth surface that isn t subject to winds this works great. I would not use it outside, however. 
8660 4 It was just what I was looking for. Plenty of space for batteries and other accessories. 
8661 4 I love it ... It does what i need 
8662 4 charges well 
8663 0 Horrible device, mine came broken, it doesn t record my voice it only records a faint hardly noticeable noise and I haven t gotten a refund because I haven t gotten around to it 
8664 3 Works just liked it s supposed to. 
8665 4 The charger worked perfectly for my Canon 40D. I was impressed by the fact that the charger included an adaptor for the car. 
8666 1 Went out of control and crashed! 
8667 2 Not as heavy duty as I d hoped. I think it s a nice tripod. 
8668 4 This is positive feedback for Beach Audio. Great, great customer service. This company cares about their customers and with so many complaining about dealing with poor customer service I want Beach Audio to get their kudos. A++++++ And we love our cameras too. 
8669 4 Pretty decent accessories and most of them are useful. KILLER price and now I have a case to store the camera in also. 
8670 4 I didn t have to wait too long for it and it worked perfectly. Thank you. Now if I can get my order for cat med for fleas!!!! 
8671 0 Camera only lasted for just over a month of use. Can t return it now because order is over 30 days old. I guess you get what you pay for. 
8672 4 its cool 
8673 4 Very impressed with this camera! Custom white balance is a welcome change, underwater macro is superb, and the new microscope mode is insane. Still need to try out the time lapse/stitching settings, but have seen some first had results and am excited. 
8674 3 To use as a wrist strap, opening larger than we thought. 
8675 0 junk. to much set up and pain in the ass to put together. i want my money back 
8676 4 I like this lens for how cheap it is. You get a lot of bang for your buck. It s my go to lens for board sports. 
8677 4 Lifesaver for the camera if landing on rough terrain. Snaps on and secured with 4 (included) zipties. 
8678 4 It works OK. 
8679 3 Good 
8680 4 Good product for the price, works just as good as a go pro for a fraction of the price. 
8681 4 It was shipped quickly. Put batteries in it and put the cassette in it and it worked perfectly. 
8682 0 The software sucks. The fingerprint reader is terrible. Highly NOT RECOMMENDED. 
8683 4 Good quality picture, alot of fun 
8684 4 good 
8685 4 Great adapter for my vintage Pentax lens. Just screw it on and forget it. Works with Metabones Speedbooster also. 
8686 4 Great product, easy set up. 
8687 4 AAAAAAA++++++ 
8688 3 This has been a great little speedlight. My only complaint is that the batteries drain VERY quickly. It uses 4 AAs at a time. I have gotten in the habit of carrying spares with me, but batteries are not cheap. Overall, it s a good product. 
8689 3 I did not buy it. 
8690 4 Awesome Product. I have an LG G4 and it fits perfectly. Easy to Set up and get it going to shoot some nice video with the phone! 
8691 3 I have taken photos in complete dark with my Nikon D5500. Photos are very good and i have observed that intensity of flash is not varying with depending upon the darkness 
8692 4 Fast service. Nice product 
8693 4 Great little lens for the price.. A little distortion on the edges. I shoot real estate and it works for me. 
8694 3 a little flamzy .but works loks like some parts may begin to give up soon 
8695 4 After shooting 1000 s of photos, I now know when to use it. When I do, pictures turn out great. 
8696 4 excellent build quality, lots of light. really great buy for the money. I bought three and a boom stand so I could do a full 3 point lighting set up. great for photography and videography. 
8697 2 i give three stars because the clip on the LCD screen side arrived broken. clip arrived broken. 
8698 4 Very easy to follow instructions, fits perfectly! 
8699 3 Love my gadgets thank you 
8700 4 fantastic lens at a great price 
8701 4 Works great. Love this battery charger. 
8702 4 Awesome pack that hasn t let me down. I may end up replacing it with a bigger Lowepro but for now it s been really great. 
8703 4 I am new to recording videos using a GOPRO and was looking for a good Kit to get me started on the right foot and I m glad I landed hear. This kit gave me lots of versatility to record a variety of videos. 
8704 4 Smart purchase. Biggest bang for the buck. 
8705 4 works well can adjust apperture 
8706 4 Is beautiful bag. 
8707 4 Works well and very durable. Must of crashed it at least 100 times and haven t broken anything yet. Longer battery life would be nice, but for the price you can t beat it. 
8708 3 Love this lens. Good build quality. The pictures I take come out very good. Buy a lens filter for it. 
8709 4 This is a good choice for zonal or hyper-focal pictures especially macro. 
8710 4 Arrived on time and as described. Works perfectly with my Go Pro Silver 
8711 4 all the features of its big brother in a compact size! excellent quality pics and video! 
8712 4 Just what I needed to mount camera on handlebar. good quality and camera feels secure. 
8713 3 I took it on vacation. It is very light. It is very strong. It is very stable. 
8714 0 The sharpness, rather better say non-sharpness after using this ND filters is terrible. I tested on high shutter speed, tripod mounted. The images is not usable. Buy expensive good quality filters or don t buy at all. 
8715 4 Love it! Kids love the picture printing. Eady to use! 
8716 3 It works as it should 
8717 4 Luxurious cover 
8718 4 it is awesome..I use it often 
8719 4 6 months later and still going strong! 
8720 3 Pretty good for the price. Takes a little time to get the cover on the camera. I wish there was some kind of instruction guide though. I could be doing this entirely wrong. 
8721 4 So far I have traveled to Israel, NYC (4 times), California, all over Florida and New England. Jets, Taxis, enormous walking, etc. This bag takes it all while still looking brand new. I just can not find any faults with this back. Sturdy, elegant and comfortable. 
8722 0 cheap crap- but I paid cheap--- you really need to get a TALLER tripod 
8723 4 Wonderful bag! Does not look like a camera bag and there is room for everything. 
8724 2 Cheap quality build and color is off 
8725 3 love everything especially the bag and head mount, however the gopole is really flimsy and i ended up buying a real gopole. but you cant beat it for the price! 
8726 3 Nice little bench top tripod - reasonably stable with camera and close up lens attached. 
8727 4 Great camera...night view is beautiful..is like daytime...recommended anytime.. 
8728 0 Work the first time coming out of the box. The next day? It stopped working. 
8729 0 please watch out. Mine was totally defect. I could not use them for my vacation. Returned them. 
8730 4 I m using this for my XIRO Xplorer quadcopter. Plenty of space for everything and more, plus plenty rugged for its price point. 
8731 4 perfect 
8732 1 The pole smells like metal and rusted after only one use. 
8733 0 flimsy 
8734 3 Great 
8735 3 The filter doesn t fit into my P Series holder, but works if I hold it up in front of the camera. Love the cool effects. 
8736 4 Delivered on time and it was exactly what I expected. 
8737 0 pain to use 
8738 3 For the price, it can t be beat. Since I already owned three of them when I ordered this one, that should speak for itself. 
8739 4 A & A makes very high quality products, and this nicely designed and well made strap is no exception. Flexible, strong and very comfortable. Highly recommend. 
8740 4 My cat chewed the cord into on my other charger, so I like the fact there is no cord, and it works just great. 
8741 3 Works great 
8742 2 :Lens was as advertised but it was supposed to come with three filters and there weren t any. I had to buy filter to protect lens. 
8743 4 Great price and quality. Good resolution with lots of features. Close up resolution could be a bit better. 
8744 4 Perfect fit for Sony RX100! 
8745 3 Works well! This case had enough room for me to store my camera as well as the charging cord. 
8746 4 sharp lens with great price. The lens gives great balance to my D800 with battery handle. 
8747 0 Poor video view and it don t have a HDMI on it 
8748 3 Battery seems to have trouble linking up to the Leica charger. I finally got it to charge and looks as though it charged fully. 
8749 4 Great camera, timely delivery 
8750 0 Sucks no other word to describe this item. A good looking watch I ll give it that but everything else sucks 
8751 4 Excelent 
8752 4 did good. did what i needed. 
8753 4 Great case for my camera. Fits my Canon very well and its a good quality. 
8754 4 I love this camera. Now I want to get the next lens up for the ability to zoom. Images are crisp, color is beautiful. This is a step up from my last camera and will be going to East Africa with me. 
8755 4 good 
8756 0 These reviews are clearly not written by real users of the product. Just read them and you ll see. 
8757 4 This lens is AWESOME. Pictures are amazing. Great purchase. 
8758 4 Excellent photo backpack. Very well priced. 
8759 0 Everything was fine. 
8760 2 Found out it is spring operated instead of battery.I don t know how long timing spring will last. Also took almost2 months for its arrival.it also rotates west to east,wrong way for tracking the heavenly bodies. 
8761 3 Works as advertised 
8762 3 Works great 
8763 4 I use this on my Manfrotto Mono-pod. I use it to hold my light. Strong and durable,and flexible for sure. I use it at all my parties and now I can t live without it. 
8764 1 The string that attaches to the camera is so thin and weak that a strong gust of wind will threaten to snap it. I lost my camera on a particularly rough dive this past winter when the string let go. 
8765 3 Okay for the price ... It had oil or something weird on it when I got it: It s pretty sturdy, though I d suggest finding something better if you have money to spend. 
8766 4 Exactly what I was expecting. For a domestic use it is hihgly recommended. 
8767 4 Perfect Fit for my tripod. 
8768 4 Excellent, as described in the publication I received, the delivery was fast without mishap, satisfied 100% 
8769 4 Great product , Nice and lightweight for hiking ! 
8770 4 excellent 
8771 4 Love this case, fits my SX280 like a glove and keeps it safe and ready. The soft inside keeps the screen from getting scratched too. 
8772 4 I bought it as a backup battery, I have no idea of the quality, but the price is worth the gamble. 
8773 4 Perfect 
8774 4 I bought this to go with my Concept2 SkiErg. Works like a charm. 
8775 4 It works just fine. 
8776 3 pros. easy setup, provided e-mail uploads. multi cloud service connectable dropbox. picasa. etc. motion sensor on/off cons. TN pannel. can t hanging - no wall mount hole. 
8777 4 AFAITH® Professional SLR Camera Tripod Monopod... was a gift for my daughter and she loved it 
8778 4 Great price Amazing quality 
8779 4 fair price 
8780 3 It s good, but hard to keep fixed in the right position. 
8781 3 As expected 
8782 4 Works like a charm on nikon d3300, timelaps, or shot photos without touching cam, like on/off button. Took me a moment to understand it all but not long, was my first of this kind 
8783 1 Completely made of plastic. Feels like a knockoff. Returned it immediately 
8784 4 Sturdy, comfortable. Works with Canon 5D and 1Ds and Sony A77 and a99. 
8785 4 Excellent product. Seems to be a durable and well constructed. Bluetooth did not work with my phone HTC 1S. Would not activate camera button. After installing Camera 360 app (awesome app) worked great. Glad I purchased this item. 
8786 4 So far the charger works well and the batteris seem to have a decent life 
8787 4 An absolute bargain. I use with my Olympus OMD EM5MII. Now I don t have to live in fear of losing one. 
8788 0 On 2nd battery, as first wouldn t charge. Still having problems and getting &#34;check battery pack&#34; message. This is after actually reading the directions that state that the battery needs to be fully cycled several times. 
8789 4 Panasonic is a top tier Li battery producer. I got these on 8/26/2015, with expiration date of January 2024. That s 8 years which is perfectly fine with me. 1/2 the current price of EverReady at retail. 
8790 4 Excellent product 
8791 4 Works wonders. My gear has never been more clean. 
8792 4 I love this camera!!!! It takes great pictures and the battery life is great!!!! 
8793 4 Used it at the beach, kept my cube clean and dry. 
8794 4 Great set of accessories for an awesome price. 
8795 3 works great just be careful taking ur phone out as my first one broke like this but other then that works as its supposed to will recoomend to others 
8796 4 ok 
8797 4 It s all ok! 
8798 2 Auto focus broke after 2 months of use. Cost me 20$ to ship back to get repaired. Luckily it s a 6 year warranty. We will see how it is when I get it back, and if it holds up. Other than that it s a decent lens. 
8799 4 love them, they are definitely a detouring device 
8800 4 Love it! 
8801 3 Received by USPS and it is decoded as it charges using Olympus Charger BCN1. Non decoded battery do not charge on this device. 
8802 4 Nice syma 
8803 4 The accessories are quality accessories! They all work quite well, they are a little harder to screw in because they aren t made my go pro, but you can t go wrong because of the low price. 
8804 4 So far these are great and a fraction of the gopro cost! I am using these for a SJCAM M10 camera. Works just fine. Seems to be high quality too. 
8805 2 First one was blurry and unusable. Had it returned. The 2nd one works just fine. Picture quality is not super, but it does the job. 
8806 2 its small its kinda cool it works. its a small very cheap toy. really. 
8807 4 I purchased this to replace a lost lens cap for my Canon 58 mm lens. It fit the lens perfectly and came with a very nice microfiber lens cleaner which I really appreciated. Arrived quickly and safely packaged. Would definitely recommend. 
8808 2 what exactly is high resolution about these pieces of glass? I threw out the cheapo case and two of the lens... I only needed a protective lens. 
8809 4 A great compact high resolution camera loaded with features. Small enough to slip into your pocket 
8810 4 Look great and can t wait to try it out. 
8811 4 Great value for what you pay for. The vest on its own is 40.00, at the store. Yeah, it s not the best quality, but it s also not bad. 
8812 4 Excellent photos in low light and great videos. A winner 
8813 4 Solid product. 
8814 4 I am pleased as usual with sony products,that is why i am a repeater customer.keep on that track and quality level and like arnold says,I WILL BE BACK.107-4228565-2601021 
8815 3 work wonderfully they are able to charge in the official Nikon charger that came with my camera D3200 and provide the same photo time 
8816 4 What a pain in the ass to get on but worth it. Snug tight fit. The adhesive strip for the collar doesn t seem to want to stay on. Maybe it was my fault since I didn t clean it thoroughly, I donno 
8817 4 Perfect fit for my camera. Easy to install. 
8818 4 It works fine 
8819 0 When I used it the water went there waterproof Case do t buy This 
8820 4 Great item. All of the family love this. Easy to use and made well. 
8821 4 just as described 
8822 3 I bought this to monitor my Whole House Humidification system in attic after a bad experience with a leak. It was a little difficult to set up but support was superior to others and works fine. 
8823 4 I like amozon. 
8824 3 Im happy with this monopod, perhaps looking back I might have spent the money on a really sturdy dedicated video tripod..... As getting perfectly still shots is still a little tricky with this. The S6 head is great! 
8825 4 good price and product. 
8826 3 works as expected 
8827 4 👍👍👍👍 
8828 3 Good product! 
8829 4 This is a great tool to use selfies on a party I went to we took 4 pictures until we got the right one...when I bought this I took a selfie of my self in 1 picture and it was perfect 
8830 0 did not focus waste of time and money 
8831 4 We needed this! 
8832 3 Works great. Cant beat the price. It was exactly what I was looking for. 
8833 4 Its been a week and i feel the camera is Awesome. We used it as novelty item for our party and all our guests loved it.. Buy one for urself and I m sure your guests will be impressed.. 
8834 0 Fits my blackmagic pocket cam but does not focus. I have a 50mm 1.8 stm canon lens on manual and it will not focus??? 
8835 4 I like this camera, I can watch my dog when I am away. The night vision is good. It rotates and tilts well enough and was up and running very fast. I will buy another one for my front door. 
8836 4 Aweomse price for a fun toy 
8837 4 Greatest little camera. Takes wonderful pictures, love the zoom, and it fits in my purse so nicely. Wonderful for traveling when nice pictures are in the plan. 
8838 0 The description states FI9826W but I received the FI9821W refurbished which is much cheaper and does not have the zoom function I expected to receive. 
8839 0 They don t stay charged long... Very disappointed.... 
8840 3 It is a little loose on the gopro, but holds it secure enough. The camera can still slide a small amount in it, but it hasn t fallen out of it yet. It would be nice if there were a way to tighten it more. 
8841 4 Works just as described by seller. Shipped promptly and was ably to enjoy & use for the trips I had planned! Perfect addition to my GoPro collection. 
8842 4 It works as designed and seems like it will last a long time, for the money. 
8843 3 It works well with my Pentax K-50 DSLR camera; now I will not be worry if the camera battery becomes discharged. 
8844 2 The WiFi receiver isn t so great. I can connect a phone, iPod, notebook to WiFi in the same place where this camera struggles to get a connection. 
8845 0 Did not fit my camera at all and when I asked to return it, they just asked me why and didn t allow me t Very disappointe 
8846 4 Worked great, no problems at all. 
8847 4 It hold s my Iphone 6plus really good, love it. 
8848 4 GOT THIS FOR MY GIRLFRIEND BECAUSE SHE SHOOTS YOUTUBE VIDEOS AND IT LOOKS AMAZING !! QUALITY OF LIGHTING IS SOO MUCH BETTER AND THIS LIGHT IS SUPER EASY TO OPERATE ! 
8849 4 GREAT PRODUCT. RECOMENDT IT. 
8850 2 even with warming filter it is still very cold. mounts are very fragile and loose. barndoors do help and the stands are decent. you only get three filters.for the price they work but don t expect them to hold up to a lot of abuse. 
8851 2 Cheaply made but gets the job done. Works well with an iPhone 6 
8852 4 very nice,better than i thought, 
8853 4 this was a steal of a deal. I was not sure if to trust the seller, but the lens was brand new, no faults and still taking good images. 
8854 3 Work as expected. Really fun to use. 
8855 2 I learned the hard way that this camera is not good at action shots. 
8856 2 Couldn t use them. my camera died. 
8857 0 save your money!!! Please dont buy it! 
8858 4 Well made and reasonably priced, very satisfied. 
8859 1 didn t work with my technology 
8860 4 Good deal 
8861 4 Great filter, works just as expected! 
8862 3 The product works well as claimed. 
8863 4 great item, very good for my a6000 
8864 4 really great camera, still reasonable weight. 
8865 3 The product is very good. Have had it for about a year now and has worked well. Had to abandon the Comcast router for another to keep the cameras from dropping out constantly. Picture quality could be better, the HD cameras might be the way to go. Hope this helps. 
8866 2 It s ok. The quality is not great but I didnt pay as much as other cameras. The battery did run out a bit quickly, had to switch batteries twice in our 5 day vacation. 
8867 4 Works great! Excellent customer service and setup too! 
8868 0 latching mechanism popped off and was lost the first time i used it! 
8869 3 As expected 
8870 4 Batteries can in good time. They work perfectly, and were a steal at the price. I will definitely order from this person again. 
8871 4 good price 
8872 4 nice 
8873 4 Excellent product, happy with the purchase. 
8874 4 Excelente 
8875 0 This was the size recommended but did not fit my lens 
8876 4 Came just as advertised. All moving parts work smoothly. Nice and light if you have to carry it any distance. This might be a small hindrance on a windy day but altogether happy with my purchase. 
8877 4 Awesome camera, so much fun! 
8878 3 Very good 
8879 4 Great drone , fast shipping 
8880 4 Very pleased 
8881 4 Does the job 
8882 4 excellent service, product works as described. 
8883 3 Good price compared to battery stores 
8884 4 Works great. 
8885 4 Heavy duty case. Used to secure my GoPro and accessories. 
8886 2 Just ok 
8887 4 Nice! 
8888 4 Love this camera. Easy to use. 
8889 2 worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks. 
8890 4 Lost the charger for my camera. Perfect replacement and cheaper than ordering original! 
8891 3 just ok 
8892 4 Good quality. 
8893 1 Lost my GoPro while whitewater rafting, as I relied on just this head strap to secure the camera to my helmet. Should have had an additional chin strap and &#34;floaty&#34; back door for some redundancy. 
8894 4 This set-up is exactly what I was looking for and at a great price. It works great with my D5300 and the off camera remote is an awesome bonus. 
8895 3 Nice kit and well built except for the &#34;selfy stick&#34;. 
8896 4 the camera harness is exceptional! I can hike, hands free and have my camera at the instant ready. Many thanks. 
8897 4 No problems, fits perfectly as described. Check your lens first to make sure you know what you are ordering. 
8898 4 Great product. 
8899 3 The camera is surpsingly small and excelent recording with good sound quality 
8900 4 Good product for a good price 
8901 4 Rainbow colors add really cool artistic touch to photos! Would definitely recommend this! 
8902 4 i love the style, color and size of this Digi Bab....will come in handy for small items when i go biking or kayaking 
8903 4 A lot of bang for the buck. Easy setup with the available app. Great day and night picture. 
8904 4 Everything was as promised. Thanks! 
8905 1 Poor quality all the way around vision is blurry and the audio pretty much don t work unless you re right on it!! But you get what you pay 4.:-! :-\ 
8906 4 I received my go pro filter in a timely manner. It fit great and it was everything I expected. 
8907 4 Great Product.... made of real good material well thought out. 
8908 3 Good camera easy to Operate The remote is not that great interfere with the TV if you have Samsung and accessories are not that strong I already had two broke Camera video quality is great 
8909 4 To sum up my experience. This is an awesome easy to use and very versatile webcam that just works. I love the movement and sound detection. 
8910 4 one word, perfect! 
8911 4 Came as described 
8912 3 Would have been better if you could see the picture you want to take through the camera, The case blocks your viewing ability. 
8913 4 OK it all! 
8914 4 Great charger 
8915 3 Love the easy of start up & using this camera having never had one prior. wish we would have got an upgraded model to view video directly on camera. works great; used biking, hiking, rappelling & in ocean. 
8916 4 I still have my old camera. Love the fact that I found this. 
8917 0 CAMERA WASN T AVAILABLE AFTER ORDERING AND CAN T GET A REFUND FROM SQUARE TRADE!!!! 
8918 4 Works Like A Charm! No Complaints Its Fits Just like the factory unit 
8919 4 Great add-on a must for any lens to keep the lens cover close! 
8920 4 Love these, 3 settings: normal, small pet, large pet. Easy to install & connect. 
8921 4 these come in very handy when I do a quick change of lens 
8922 0 Horrible camera. 
8923 3 Pretty much what you d expect. Works fine, not elegant construction, ask me in a year how sturdy it is. 
8924 2 Good image quality, battery life is short so I bought rechargeable batteries 
8925 1 Zippers no good both have broken off. now I need a new bag 
8926 1 Does not appear to work unless plugged directly into router. I have asked how to get it to connect on its own without the ethernet cable but received no response. 
8927 4 Gave it as a gift and she loves it. Sturdy construction and very roomy. 
8928 0 wrong cord 
8929 4 Great product and a great price with fast delivery. 
8930 4 Very good quality, especially the velvet on the back of the strap that keeps it from slipping off the shoulder and adds comfort when hung around the neck. Colors are very vibrant. 
8931 4 Nice beginners kit. We use it for green screen videos. Works great. 
8932 4 Convenient and protects well. I m glad I got it, especially since the camera does not have a lens cover. 
8933 4 Perfect companion to camera. 
8934 4 Great product with long range capability. 
8935 4 Great for keeping my lenses clean 
8936 4 Used in many of my bags and protects all the equipment. 
8937 4 Works exactly as advertised 
8938 4 Very high quality camera bag with a ton of space for extra lenses or multiple cameras. Exceeded expectations! 
8939 4 What can I say. this table tripod is so sturdy it can hold my Canon 70D with a Canon 70-200 2.8 IS II with the tripod attached to the lens. This tripod is always in my camera bag and very helpful when in the field. 
8940 4 excellent camera, meets all functionalities, all good quality fittings The price and quality of the camera is great. 100% recommended this item In love with my camera 
8941 4 Very good camera 
8942 3 Excellent product and accessories. 
8943 2 VERY short range!! 
8944 4 like advertised! I was able to fit in far more number of accessories than i expected. The medium case makes a lot of sense size wise unless you are working for a production media house. :) 
8945 4 Works great on my a6000 and a7ii. No batteries to go dead. 
8946 4 This bundle is wonderful. It has everything one could ever need for learning how to use a DSLR. I am still learning so much and this kit covers all of it. Absolute best starter kit one could ask for. 
8947 4 It s all ok! 
8948 4 I do love this camera, so does my wife, very easy to master and such high quality images. Expensive for a small camera but definitely worth it. 
8949 4 Works well and comes in handy. 
8950 4 Love it & great for beginner. Travel friendly. 
8951 4 Very nice bokek lens. 
8952 4 Great product. Arrived In 2 days. Gave it a &#34;once over&#34; then closed it & held it under water for about 10 minutes. Upon inspection the inside was dry. Definitely a smart investment for a minimal price 
8953 4 Works great. The only tip try fixing the right angle and check a pre video of it, before jumping into your board. It will save you some dissappointment time. 
8954 3 Very good product, great deal for the money i pay, 
8955 4 As advertised 
8956 4 Shipped quickly and was as expected 
8957 4 Great product! The product arrived quickly with no issues. 
8958 4 Worked fine have purchased these before 
8959 4 Versatile and small. Not heavy at all,but can hold alot of weight if need be. I have put a light, a receiver,and a mic on this piece and it has not let me down. 
8960 4 works great and fixed issue of camera not staying on :) 
8961 4 This camera is great, the goodies that came with it are awesome too. It survived a direct hit from several water balloons, shaving cream, and a few high speed drops while filming an event. Great point and shoot with the flexibility of an action camera. 
8962 4 Shipping was incredibly fast and arrived 2 days early even without prime. Both batteries work and everything is correct. Nothing much complicated about this. They are batteries. Either they work or they dont. 
8963 1 Stiff on the neck 
8964 4 as expected. 
8965 4 Great buy. More batteries life. 
8966 3 Purchased this during Amazon s anniversary sale. Works as intended, it seems to be well built out of some solid plastic. I ll trust that it will hold my camera just fine. It s not the greatest stabilization, but way better than just hand holding the camera. 
8967 4 Very good. 
8968 4 Great binoculars for birdwatching. 
8969 3 It was no problem to use or appearance. 
8970 4 Just what I wanted! Thanks. 
8971 4 I got this for my sister for her birthday. I can t believe the amount of accessories that came with it! Was way more than expected and I know she s absolutely going to love this! Also shipped super fast! Thanks! 
8972 3 Excelent product 
8973 4 works well 
8974 4 I love the album...it is exactly what I wanted. Gallery Leather has earned 5 stars from this satisfied customer. The service was prompt and the delivery right on time. Thanks so much. rpb 
8975 4 WOW WHAT A CAMERA! Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS45W FULL STEAM ahead. A great travel zoom camera MUST.Wifi \ 16 MP \easy upload\ video perfect. 
8976 4 GoPro 
8977 2 the size is suitable for small jobs but I would like the power of the lamps was better. 
8978 4 Surprisingly versatile with a firm grip. I much prefer this set to the OEM Sony backpack mount. 
8979 4 great 
8980 4 Price was good, and the cable works just great with my camera so no complaints at all. Looks like it s good quality too. 
8981 4 Picture quality is great and is easy to use. Convenient size making picture taking in close up situations easier than pulling out the SLR. 
8982 3 Good scope. Easy to set up and use. Better optics then the price would suggest. 
8983 4 Very easily to use and small enough to carry around with you on trips. 
8984 3 Perfect match ! 
8985 4 Exact replacement. Needed a good additional battery for outdoor travels! 
8986 3 Perfect 
8987 3 The charger came in ahead of promised date and was as advertised 
8988 4 It is a very good deal for the amateur photographer. I love the pictures that it takes. Very simple to operate. 
8989 4 bought it for my daughter, she loves it. 
8990 4 Excellent product 
8991 4 Fast shipping! Items came as I expected. Good quality and I definitely will order from 47th again. 
8992 4 these stands are very light, appear a little delicate, but with good handling are fantastic 
8993 4 awesome! 
8994 4 I love this products and ill suggest any one who do diving to buy. Its really nice 
8995 2 As ordered. On time. A bit awkward to use. Not as useful as I had hoped. 
8996 0 Return it 
8997 0 The ring does not work at all !! It is not possible to focus properly with any FD-lens, probably due to the inserted ekstra lens in the adapter. Waste of Money ! Frank Visti 
8998 4 Solid little camera extension, I used it with a GoPro 
8999 4 These batteries seem to work well. The battery that the collar came with is still working fine. I will be able to comment more after I have used these. Thanks! 
9000 3 Added some life to a laptop we were ready to toss out. Fits perfectly and seems to hold a charge reasonably well. 
9001 1 Too small for the camera models suggested. 
9002 3 Seems to be working fine 
9003 2 Great photos but there is a long lag in video recording. 
9004 3 Great camera for a beginner like me :) 
9005 2 The case it self was very nice but there was lots of delays 
9006 2 Great Value! 
9007 2 I think the Note about no hard drive should be up at the top. I know this is intentional to sell a system cheap. 
9008 4 pleased with the order.:) 
9009 2 Isnt last as long as the Sony battery. 
9010 1 Way too big for this girl. 
9011 4 Not pro quality but a good get by. Mine was missing the cleaning cloth. Sharpness a little weak on the edges but very usable. 
9012 0 this gooseneck is worthless, it is almost impossible to twist (massive grip between the joints) and any flexion or shortening (separating the joints) causes them to fracture. Boooo! 
9013 3 Look real and your nosey neighbors will look like dummies! 
9014 1 Camera worked well in &#34;live&#34; mode, but failed to respond in &#34;motion detection&#34; at any setting on both cameras I purchased. Easy to set up and a great clear picture, but I purchased them for the motion detection feature and cannot get it to work after a month of trying. 
9015 4 Excellent product. Great construction. Put this on my bicycle along a 12 mile trail and it was perfect. No complaints. 
9016 4 Works as described. Forgot it s there after a few days now always have a record of all activity. 
9017 4 very nice~! 
9018 4 It is very well made and versatile. I use it for a compact camera bag with space for extra batteries. I took it on a cruise and it was rugged and did an excellent job. 
9019 4 Works great! 
9020 4 I received it earlier than expected which is great! It works really well, I had it on the side of my car for the first time and it stayed on. Good quality and price! I will buy it again with my second GoPro. 
9021 4 Well made bigger than I expected. I will order a scene set for more bounce work. Shipping was slower than expected but was reasonable. 
9022 4 Product arrived very promptly, great pricing for a beginner set. I couldn t be happier with my purchase! 
9023 4 Love it! Does everything it says. Great price 
9024 4 Perfect... 
9025 0 The leg post will not work after a few uses. The locking mechanism is cheaply made and, after a short time, will break. I can only use it from a sitting position now - not standing as the legs will not elongate anymore. Very disappointing. 
9026 0 Sent this back. I m not a rocket scientist. 
9027 4 Excellent product,quick to charge two batteries in about half the time of the charger that came with the camera. Has a screen that tells the amount of charge the battery has and how much more charge is needed to get a fully charged battery. 
9028 4 Super clear, Decided on 12 over 10 for Colorado trip. fast shipping 
9029 3 Mainly plastic but it does hold a small camera on a bike very well. Does the job. 
9030 4 5 years later still working perfect. only downfall is the battery level reading is inaccurate 
9031 4 I really like the price but I was really surprised by the quality of the product I thought it would have been a GoPro product by looking at it 
9032 3 Very good 
9033 0 The remote did not work with my canon 5D as indicated. 
9034 4 Love it! 
9035 2 I gave it as a gift. It s OK. 
9036 4 works fine. it seems sturdy enough. 
9037 4 Tried it on my car and didn t scratch or fall off! 
9038 2 One of the two I used broke on the prongs 
9039 3 Good color, great wide angle view, it worth the money! 
9040 0 we used it twice and one of the propellers stopped working. don t know how to get ahold of anyone for parts and if there is a warranty 
9041 0 pretty sure this is copy write infringement... or at the very least toeing the line. http://store.froknowsphoto.com/ 
9042 0 Returned the product. Items were missing from a sealed box. 
9043 1 first one was not connecting wireless to phone or ipad. was on phone with tech support for 90 minutes and they couldn t get it to work. Will try a replacement. Software would not recognize camera and connect. 
9044 4 fits right! 
9045 4 Perfect replacement for GoPro Hero 4 Silver case. Original was cheap plastic which broke in no time. Be sure to add some threadlock to the screw that holds this part in place. 
9046 4 Worked perfectly as described!!! 
9047 3 Got all my solar lights going again without costing a fortune. 
9048 4 works fine 
9049 0 The add listed this as a Panasonic Lumix charger. It is a GENERIC charger that barely even works and it is so bulky it won t fit into my small camera bag like the original Panasonic charger did. 
9050 4 Great product! 
9051 1 Battery function does not work cannot seem to charge battery. 
9052 4 Excellent 
9053 4 This is another product that I got for my trip and I can t say enough about it. I m in love with this camera. I got if for myself as a gift for my birthday and it works great. I m so glad that I got it. 
9054 1 Can t get it to work. It works maybe once out of ever 20 clicks if I hold it right up against the camera. I m using it with a Nikon D3200 
9055 4 Great product and Amazon customer service is top notch. Thank you 
9056 4 Works fine, indistinguishable from the original. 
9057 4 Never lose your cap again--such a simple idea, works great! 
9058 0 Missing half of what s in the listing 
9059 4 Really good product , especially using it to hold the baby monitor. 
9060 4 batteries as advertised mor power than factory battery 
9061 4 kept me from losing my GoPro camera while snorkeling in the Virgin Islands! 
9062 4 Called for customer serviec and spoke with Walter. Made it a breeze to set up. 
9063 4 Best security cameras. Better than I expected. Set up was such a breeze. Customer service is wonderful! Had th3se for a few months now and I couldn t be happier!! Getting ready to order 4 more cameras. 
9064 4 Very good product and really does look like a TV or computer is being used. 
9065 3 This camera works pretty good 
9066 4 Amazing device! Must try! 
9067 2 flash is great, remote not so much. go with the flash only kit. 
9068 4 All good. 
9069 0 I bought this screen protector and was excited to use it. I put it on my D7100 and it s immediately cracked on the right corner. I m terribly disappointed with this product and I will be returning it immediately. 
9070 3 Good cleaning cloth for my glasses. It does require hand-wash which maintains it. 
9071 4 I havent dropped my GoPro in a lake or the ocean yet- so I will update my post when I do. It looks great on my camera tho! 
9072 2 its good for protection but its restrict the movement of screen for selfie etc 
9073 3 really pretty good.... 
9074 4 Comes with a pricetag however much better than friction mounts that looks like this at the fraction of the cost. This arm will not drop your monitor or camera any time soon. 
9075 2 I was very disappointed the case will not hold the camera. I would like to contact the seller.I am satisfied with the camera. 
9076 3 Would have given it a five star review after the first handful of wearing. Only four one as it is not quite as effective but still helps. 
9077 4 Great replacement. Fit great. 
9078 4 Great little device that simplifies password hassels, well made and fantastic quality 
9079 3 Nice product. Liked it a lot. 
9080 3 Handy, but the clip broke from me picking it up without even touching the clip... But I ll cut it some slack for the low price. 
9081 4 Two thumbs up! Very happy with this lens! 
9082 4 Happy with this 
9083 3 Charger and batteries work great! 
9084 4 Shipped fast, worked as anticipated! 
9085 0 Pretty poor quality. It doesn t hold the flashes secure. I had them fall out a few times and it broke after just two days of use. I cannot recommend this 
9086 3 I love the camera, it gives me great pictures, many choices and easy to use. 
9087 4 it was a gift he loved it 
9088 4 I had the same product when it was produced by pentex 
9089 4 great in the garage but not so much in active living space. 
9090 2 After a few months, it doesn t satisfyingly click into place. And when you put it on backwards it doesn t stay in place really well. Overall, does it s job well. 
9091 4 Very useful!!! 
9092 4 Love it 
9093 4 very easy to use, fast shipping. 
9094 4 Top of the line! What more can i say! 
9095 4 All ok 
9096 3 small compact, only negative is the center column, Worked great with it down and a good ball head. I am 5 5 so the center column was down most of the time. I liked the retractable spike in the feet. 
9097 4 Camera takes very nice pictures and video. The lens that is included is amazing. This package deal included everything that I needed to start out. 
9098 4 Excellent customer service. Great cameras. 
9099 4 I have big wrist and it fits well 
9100 4 I love my Nissin flash. This thing has great power for the size. The zoom operation is a bit funky though. 
9101 4 Cord is a tad short but the device works very well. Pretty straight forward. Make sure to pick up a pack of AAA batteries before ordering. 
9102 4 Perfect 
9103 0 threw charger away kept batteryfor clickers 
9104 3 Works well except the light is substandard. 
9105 4 Great case for XQD cards 
9106 1 excellent item, solved my problem 
9107 4 [[ASIN:B004BDNJZA Jill-e Designs 022738 Clutch for Camera (Red)]] 
9108 4 Works exactly as expected. Christmas morning pictures last year turned out awesome! 
9109 3 Charger works great.. on occasion it will report that one battery isn t fully charged, but when you remove the &#34;full&#34; battery, the other then immediately reports as being full. Good enough. 
9110 3 Camera is easy to use but a lot of that power goes to waste when you cant process RAW images...Canon s web site blows when it comes to downloading codec. 
9111 4 easy to set up and excellent quality great customer service 
9112 4 it s small and perfect 
9113 4 Great product easy to use, works as designed. 
9114 4 I wish they sold this case without the foam, but the case isn t that expensive so I just threw the foam away. 
9115 4 Highly Recommended! 
9116 2 A little on the big side got to use at an angle but does get the job done 
9117 4 Just as described , works and feels wonderful on my camera ;) 
9118 4 GRREAT!!! 
9119 4 super cool 
9120 2 For the cost I expected either an aluminum lense hood or one of the fouls back rubber types. What I got was a thin plastic hood that looks like it could break easily. I ll have to be careful. 
9121 4 Excellent lens for the money. 
9122 4 Performs very well. Carry it with me most of the time. 
9123 0 Total pain in the butt to set up!! 
9124 0 excellent item, solved my problem 
9125 3 seem to work great. 
9126 4 Really nice lens. Great quality, smooth focus and very sharp. Works with my fujifilm xe-1 
9127 3 One of the best values you ll find in a camera accessory of its type but be prepared for sparse and poorly written instruction that truly have to be read with a magnifier. 
9128 4 Arrived on time and worked great!! 
9129 4 Not quite up to the Olympus branded original battery but low price; I carry 3 in my camera bag - never w/o power. 
9130 4 i loved it...... until it got lost in the ocean witch was NOT the proudcts fualt 
9131 4 so cute and so portable. :D 
9132 2 I liked all the attachments but only a few of the fit my gopro 4 
9133 4 Worth the price! 
9134 4 Great camera for our school. These are &#34;little bit&#34; wide angle so they work great in ceiling tiles. We used mostly these and couple of the regular UVC s and Pro s for a small school installation and it works great. Yet another awesomely useful hardware by Ubiquiti. 
9135 4 It worked great to charge my camera. Recommended. 
9136 0 Was not what I expected! 
9137 3 Great 
9138 4 Considering the price of a Hoya CPL filter, this works great, cuts glare, enhances colors, makes the blue sky more blue and the clouds stand out. 
9139 4 Shipping is fast and quality is good 
9140 2 it s alright 
9141 3 helps with my photo work 
9142 3 great seller,nice product,for now it works well 
9143 2 It seemed to be a fine product at a great price. However I returned it because it wouldn t work with my intended lens. Great service by the seller. Was not his fault. 
9144 3 It does mostly what I want. It takes some figuring out but if you read the Q&A below it s doable. Still trying to figure out how to set the time, but for what you pay, it s pretty damn good. 
9145 3 Just got mine today it feels good in the head but never tried and water oh and plus the wrist strap is too small and is weird 
9146 4 Great little pack for those long trips and vacations. 
9147 0 Product was described to work with go pro camera mounts. The mount would not tighten to secure the go pro. Reached out to the seller with no response. Extremely disappointed. 
9148 4 The eTopxizu go pro is awesome. I couldn t use the jaw clamp on my bike but put a quick release self adhesive clip on my bike and works great very nice setup. 
9149 4 Easy set up and easy to use! I love the ease with which I was able to install this camera and the clarity of the picture! 
9150 4 Works great on all of our apple products. The price was amazing for the the amount of cloths you get. I highly recommend this product if you have any electronic that need a soft cloth. I will be buying more when I need them or for a gift. 
9151 4 Great Product! I used this for a Tough Mudder and has no issues with it falling off, slipping, or bouncing around. Very Comfortable product as well. 
9152 4 Awesome Camera... small and the quality...is great 
9153 1 It works fine not the best picture at nice. I found another camera that 800 tvl and $1.50 cheat. With way better picture and much better night view. I would not buy this one again 
9154 4 works great plugged it in and mount the sensor that s it 
9155 4 GREAT CAMERA FOR THE PRICE. KEEP IT AROUND MY NECK ON MOTORCYCLE TRIPS FOR THOSE UNEXPECTED MOMENTS............. 
9156 4 nice 
9157 3 I am happy about this battery. Works good. Thanks... 
9158 4 Works perfectly. Why anybody would spend four to six times as much for the branded equivalent is beyond me. 
9159 0 Horrible what a waste of my hard earned money is all I can say! I did not even want to give it a star pretty sorry! 
9160 0 This doesnt even deserve one star. 
9161 4 Solid build, sharp design & perfect match! 
9162 1 This case was okay when new but, over time, the inside lining started to fray. Some of the lint got into the camera and damaged it. The camera lens can no longer zoom. 
9163 3 Purchased without a hitch, but never was able to register as the camera I purchased this for was a poor quality camera that arrived damaged and was returned. 
9164 4 Exactly what I wanted to toss into my camera bag. Makes setting a white/grey/black balance in variable lighting conditions easy. I like to shoot one picture at the beginning of a series with these cards visible. Then when I get into Lightroom/Photoshop I can quickly set my white balance. 
9165 4 This is from a very fine German firm Schneider. I have been to their factory and seen their works. They have been one of the finest lens makers in the world for many years. There is a noticeable difference between this and other filters. 
9166 4 Works perfectly, very durable. 
9167 3 The charger works well, but very disappointed that caps are not on the batteries in order to prevent them from shorting out in camera bag. I liked the tripod and cleaning kit that came with it, however the battery caps are more important. 
9168 1 Motion trigger is pretty good. Lightning trigger is rubbish!! 
9169 4 Great picture frames. Used them as part of a centerpiece. 
9170 0 The swabs were different sizes and all it did was smear cleaning solution on my sensor. I ended up having to pay to have it professionally cleaned anyway. 
9171 4 Nice photos 
9172 4 Just what I needed. 
9173 1 To much to adjust. Head locking device does not hold the scope tight. The screw that tensions on the scope mount fell out on my first back packing trip. Also a little heavy. 
9174 4 awesome 
9175 1 the battery arrived two days later than expected. for whatever reason, the batter charge only lasted 1 day before having to recharge it again. Now after one month, the batter is no longer chargeable. 
9176 4 The quality of this I thought was going to be cheep. I was surprised very sturdy well worth the money! 
9177 4 I use this bag for my Nikon D7100. Plenty of room in the bag, without being bulky. A great bag for the price, I highly recommend it. 
9178 4 The GOBUDi stick totally met my expectations. It s got a nice and practical design. Couldn t expect any better for this prize. 
9179 4 Good and useful 
9180 0 Received replacement, worse than the first, all the unit does it vibrate, then shuts off, then starts to continuously vibrate again without any input from the remote, remote is totally useless. Starting to believe that there is no quality control or testing before sending these products out. 
9181 4 Havent tried them out yet. Got them for vacation. But tried my friends and ig these work as well they will be great. 
9182 0 Blocked out too much light. Couldn t see much with it and when I returned it I had to pay the shipping 
9183 3 Product received undamaged and works as expected. 
9184 4 Perfect for camera. Great space for several attachments 
9185 4 cool 
9186 0 The instructions on disk do not go well with this clock. The buttons are not labeled the same or even close to what is in the instructions. I don t have the time to decode it. I wouldn t make this purchase again. 
9187 4 Great Product, just wish they wouldnt put any lettering on outside but can easily be removed with sand paper..Great Price 
9188 4 Excellent camera! 
9189 4 Very happy 
9190 3 Nice camera for it size and cost 
9191 4 I was looking for a better camera for casual family shots as my old one took so long to recover between shots. This seems to fit what I need in a simple to operate mode. It was also in the price range I was looking for. 
9192 1 Rated these 2 stars because although these are really cool. They are not HD. They aren t worth this much money if they are claiming to be full 1080p HD because they aren t high quality. 
9193 4 GREAT CAMERA EVEN DURING WINTER IT CA DO IT MAKE GREEN TREE COLOR 
9194 1 this camera software is not good , and setup is not very ease , after some figuring out got it to work but would not buy again , the camera specs are good but the app to operate on mobile app is not, remote view away from home gives trouble 
9195 0 Came missing parts. 
9196 0 Much larger and bulkier than I thought it d be. 
9197 4 Worked perfectly with my Sony Xperia Z3 phone. It succeed my expectations. Will recommend to my friends 
9198 4 Received exactly as described. We are still working our way through figuring out how to use all of the attachments! 
9199 4 Excelent product 
9200 0 [[ASIN:B00OV9IB2A Spy Tec STI_ZIR32 Surveillance Cameras]] 
9201 4 Keeps me at ease, took a lil bit of time to learn but got it down! 
9202 4 Awesome 
9203 4 Amazing tripod head, works great! 
9204 4 I used these in my Nikon camera and have had excellent luck. I see no difference in battery life between these and the factory original. I think these actually have more milliwhatevers than the factory one. 
9205 4 So worth getting the bulk pack instead of buying them individually. You save money and have lots of film just in case :) 
9206 4 Great lens. Can not beat it for the price. 
9207 0 The plug was obviously corroded before it was shipped out. I should have taken the other recent reviews at face value. 
9208 4 Batteries arrived quickly. High quality product. Everything in order. Highly recommend. 
9209 4 Great 
9210 3 Working good but not very easy to install on flash. Size for standard size (not small) flashes only. 
9211 4 Fits the Canon powershot SX60 well. Light and certainly fit for purpose. 
9212 4 Works great, took a while to realize if in the locked position, the camera does not recognize it. 
9213 3 rec d as promised and as advertised 
9214 3 Good enough for me. I haven t used the Nikon or Sigma wide angles so I can t compare, but this one has F/2.8, good autofocus and is wide enough for interiors and landscape. 
9215 4 Amazing product. We ve used the heck out of it since we bought it! Took it on a vacation to south Florida and it helped us make and remember more memories than we ve been able to before. It s a great buy I highly recommend. 
9216 4 A wonderful pocket camera. 
9217 3 Solidly built. Haven t figured the LCD display yet. The remote is line-of-sight, if you re off by a couple of degrees it won t work. 
9218 2 Small one isn t as small as I hoped and the large ones are huge. Well enough made and will protect the lenses. 
9219 2 Great Value! 
9220 4 convenient. Adds a lot of life. 
9221 4 awesome case. very well made and solid. love it for my camera lenses!!! 
9222 1 Case leaks you get what you pay for 
9223 4 This monopod is light, extremely strong and stable. Wish I d found this sooner. 
9224 4 It was the best GoPro on the market.. Do your research. 
9225 0 what was advertised as a &#34;kit&#34; containing mini tripod and micro sd card, was just the case. 
9226 3 bought it as a gift ...need an accessories bag for all the stuff! 
9227 4 was very satisfied with the product,work excellent with my camcorder. 
9228 3 WIFI is iffy, would be better with Bluetooth or screen mirroring technology. Hard to use if you have large hands. 
9229 4 Its a great battery but its a high price is there a OEM cheaper ??? 
9230 4 Great deal for price. 
9231 4 I tried other suction cup products but this is the best one. Holds firm driving on pretty rugged roads. 
9232 4 Works like a charm with my Nikon camera when i went ziplining recently. Very sturdy and well built. 
9233 0 Arrived broken! 
9234 4 Fast delivery and products were as advertised 
9235 4 Used it a few times already, great audio. 
9236 4 Best lens you can get. One of the sharpest if not the sharpest. 
9237 4 Thanks!!! 
9238 0 Stopped working and I waited to long to return it. 
9239 4 Great price. 
9240 4 Exactly what I was expecting. Thank you! 
9241 0 Does the job but overpriced! 
9242 4 Have only been using this camera for about a week. I was using a D7100 which I love. The D750 allows me to take full advantage of some of my older &#34;pre digital&#34; Nikon lenses. Its early but so far I love this camera. 
9243 4 Excellent mount 
9244 4 This may be cheaper than the Canon brand but it works great! I love my knew lens hood! 
9245 4 Pretty new, so no qualitative evaluation I can provide yet. Looks good and worked perfectly so far. 
9246 0 When I bought this as a stand alone wireless camera and it was no such thing. This camera is an add on to a system that has a special screen and receiver. 
9247 3 Good 
9248 0 App wouldn t work. 
9249 4 highly recomend it. It works great with my nikon d3200. 
9250 2 This didn t last very long. I purchased it in mid Feb 2015 and had to replace it by August because i it was very dim. It started out ok. 
9251 4 It s out of this world it is unbelievable lens every shut I take the pictures come out beautiful so I recommend whoever buys his lens they getting their moneys worth and that s all I have to say 
9252 4 A perfect replacement. 
9253 3 Good product. Very happy with purchase. 
9254 0 Tip kept coming off and was lost after the 2nd day. Poor quality, junk. 
9255 4 very good and fast service would order again 
9256 0 Just had it professionally installed for it to not even work! it looked legit and brand new so never thought about asking them to test it first. 
9257 4 I really love the soft focus and star filter. Very high quality for the price and I highly recommend for amateur/hobby photographers. 
9258 3 Very hard to pull the spring open to fit my phone in it. 
9259 4 Top seller, very impressed with prompt delivery,item as described by seller, recommend to all. Thank you, will buy again. 
9260 4 As expected 
9261 3 Used on Alaska cruise. Very satisfied. 
9262 2 Cute unit, PA crap, NO WHERE CLOSE TO 100 watt power 
9263 4 Nice camera. Takes great photos and also nice videos. Used it on a trip to Ireland and lots of people were envious of me when I started taking videos of people dancing in an Irish pub. 
9264 4 Great affordable camera grip for videos 
9265 4 love it 
9266 4 Perfect fit and excellent value 
9267 3 good price 
9268 4 Very expensive but very well made and a must for leveling cameras on tripods without a leveling bowl. 
9269 4 these clips are so strong they will take the him off the side of our screen if you pull them that hard. So nice to be able to get the screen as tight as I want without having them pull off. 
9270 4 Works like a charm! I was previously using my canon flash without this hot shoe adapter and it would not make a good connection when I changed my angle and not flash. Now, works perfectly every time. 
9271 4 Light yet burly. Great for extreme skiing. 
9272 2 The concept of great, but after receiving the holders, I discovered I have to remove the lens cap first, if I want to add or remove the lens hood. 
9273 4 very good 
9274 4 Perfect size. Good quality. 
9275 4 Great customer service! They will strive to take care of you. Solid construction. A great value for the price! 
9276 4 The product came quickly and works as it should. Run time is the same or maybe a little longer than the factory battery. 
9277 4 It works really well. Went and bought another. 
9278 0 It does not work the ac adapter is broke and they just keep telling they are out of them to wait. it has been 3 months 
9279 4 Focus pretty fast and quiet. 
9280 4 Can t tell the difference between this and a regular tv picture from the outside of the house. Great job whoever invented this thing. 
9281 4 Work good 
9282 4 Pictures look great ! 
9283 4 Light weight - but very good distance vision capability. Easy to adjust. 
9284 4 Works great. I like using this better than my helmet mount. 
9285 3 Love it! It would be five stars if it had longer battery life. Tons of great functions, apps and more... My best camera ever! 
9286 4 Even has night vision in the house Easy to install Had to buy 100 ft extension cables to use outside 
9287 4 great! 
9288 3 Decent quality. The best part is that most of these items are small and easy to put into your camera bag without taking up too much space. 
9289 4 its works fine. 
9290 2 It was late but that s my only real issue with it. I would have liked it if it came with a fur more extra screws but for the price it s okay. 
9291 4 Lots of room for lots of accessories and the cam - good product. 
9292 4 Fast delivery, easy to put on and take off. Use it mainly for lense protection 
9293 4 Exceptional 
9294 4 Fast shipping works excellent 
9295 2 The charger works, but it is very difficult to attach it to the battery. The first time I tried, I broke off the little plastic part that is intended to hold it in place. 
9296 0 was the right size, worked great. Have had it for almost 2 months, and it quit working. paid $138 for a monitor to work for 2 months. It is past the returns 30 day window so amazon is saying no refund or exchange. Very unsatisfied. 
9297 1 Some parts broke after use , some are working ok 
9298 4 good choice well worth the money. 
9299 2 huhh, it s alright tiny! 
9300 3 Worked great with our Intvo a camera. We dove at Key Largo, Florida and recommended the floats after a fellow diver dropped his GoPro while climbing back into the boat. 
9301 3 Nice lol gadget 
9302 4 Always the highest quality for the price. 
9303 4 Everything you expect from Domke. Well made, well thought out, reasonably priced. I have half a dozen Domke bags, have for years, and no other bag has served me nearly as well 
9304 4 This is the best camera I have ever had. So easy to use, I love the instant pictures. Fun to share with friends. Love it. 
9305 4 Excellent 
9306 2 Works ... its just a battery ....... Not prime rib dinner ! 
9307 4 I am using it on a flip flash bracket. It s the perfect length! It s holding the flash very well and I have yet to have any issues after using it for a few weeks. 
9308 4 Item arrived as promised. Batteries and charger work great. The cleaning supplies are a good bonus. The price is great! I recommend this product to anyone looking to buy extra batteries for their camera. Works great with a canon rebel t3i. 
9309 4 This is my first flash and it is perfect! 
9310 4 It was good as it was supposed to. 
9311 0 did not work, returned 
9312 4 Perfect camera. Takes excellent pictures. I have been able to capture birds in flight from quite a distance, which is exactly why I purchased the camera. Shutter speed is exactly as manufacture describes. 
9313 4 Suction Cup is amazing the arm is very versatile! 
9314 2 Quality just wasnt there, Returned it. 
9315 3 Good product for the price. 
9316 0 terrible 
9317 4 Product was as advertised. 
9318 4 Enjoy thid item 
9319 4 Beautiful beads. I absolutely love them, actually want another set. Thank you. 
9320 4 Works just fine and is easy to use. A good purchase. 
9321 3 Fits all my stuff, just a couple inches more would have made it great. 
9322 4 Best camera purchase yet! 
9323 1 One of my six units quit working after only 3 weeks, I contacted the seller and they said to send back the intercom that doesn t work at MY EXPENSE. 
9324 2 It works, but I m not blown away. I like the form factor. GREAT size and VERY convenient that it folds away. 
9325 4 Very good service I m happy 
9326 1 Leaking - will be returning for refund. Maybe I just got a dud? 
9327 4 Very nice comfy strap. 
9328 4 Very good product 
9329 4 Keeps my drive protected. Has room for papers or anything else plus the cord. 
9330 3 It is more than I expected 
9331 4 Just what I needed to convert my mount for my contour 
9332 2 works great. 
9333 0 This camera worked one time, first timeIhave been disappointed with an item I bought on Amazon. 
9334 4 So nice to have when out and about, can carry around neck without bulk, or protects camera when putting it in a bigger bag. 
9335 4 Essential tool for serious photographers when editiing their photos either on Mac or Windows. Sensor is much smaller than on previous versions and technical support is outstanding. 
9336 3 Great product works with my mobile phone remotely great just wish it was HD 
9337 1 Should have known better, for the price, it is exactly what I should have expected. 
9338 4 The Q-See cameras I installed are working great.I believe everyone should have them at their residence. Q-See products deliver what they promise. 
9339 4 I ll never use a sandbag again! 
9340 4 Nuce 
9341 4 Thank you 
9342 4 Great service. Works well and easy to take on trip. 
9343 4 With this bag I am actually using my camera more. I can get my camera out and put it back without ever setting the bag down. I prefer this over a backpack style bag. 
9344 0 Helmet mount worthless so much for getting footage of Sturgis don t waste your money buy a gopro 
9345 4 Excellent lens. Perfoms as stated. 
9346 3 Works great. i might have to get another one. 
9347 0 This is junk 
9348 1 I got this but soon realized that, I don t typically want to share a photo with anyone/anything before editing it a bit in Photoshop. So...not really using it at the moment. I did a small amount if testing and I had no problems with it. 
9349 4 Worked great. I mounted it on a vertical bar in an aerobatic airplane when I had my first lesson doing spins, rolls and loops. If is stays in place doing that, it should withstand most bicycle maneuvers 
9350 4 quick delivery perfect quality 
9351 1 I no longer own this camera. It has a propensity of shutting in mid use. 
9352 4 This is the second unit I bought to give as gifts. Copter can take some crashes without any damage, For the money I think this is a good deal for the price.. 
9353 4 Absolutely worth every penny! 
9354 4 The Monopod Tripod Mount is a perfect product for mounting you device on a selfie stick or any type of tripod. It is a perfect accessory for capturing those memorable moments in life. I love using it on my selfie stick to create family videos. 
9355 3 Works great!! Unfortunately, it doesn t come with the &#34;J-Hook&#34; so you can mount your Go Pro Camera. (I have a Go Pro 2) Not a big deal though. There are plenty of places that sell it on Amazon. Fast shipping. Good pprice. 
9356 4 i Received a power2000 charger XP-333-29 with four 2900 MAH rechargeable batteries, which is a good deal, Although I did not receive the one picured in the ad, I am satisfied as I said before, and no further action need be taken 
9357 4 Does exactly what it should and does it well. 
9358 3 Works just as described by others. See the Flickr pool for this lens for examples of what it can/cannot do. 
9359 4 Great product! 
9360 4 Great product. Been working on 16 CH system with no issues. A+ 
9361 4 using for my 10x nd filter 
9362 2 Too thin 
9363 3 I like this product and will buy again. 
9364 4 This is a great lens cap. Ruged material and fits my canon SX 40HS perfectly. I highly recommend it. 
9365 3 These are pretty cool, great picture, easy install. The toggle adjustment switch was just a little problem getting into 1/2 conduit sleeve to hide in gang box outside. Otherwise, happy with purchase! 
9366 1 I love the filter, but find it difficult to get on and off the lens. 
9367 4 There is only one word for this product.....AWESOME! 
9368 4 Convenient, inexpensive and easy to use. 
9369 1 Glass was flawed with a discolored spot within the middle third of the filter. Rendered unusable. Should have been a rejected product. 
9370 4 This adapter is a great buy. I allowed me to really explore my camera and what it can do. Before this purchase I had to rush and get pictures taken before the batteries ran down. Now I can take my time. 
9371 4 Great package of accessories for the GoPro! 
9372 4 really good buy and excellent transmission capabilities, made four odd lengths from 100 
9373 4 great for small scale usage 
9374 4 just nice to have a back up battery. 
9375 0 This tripod would not seat my camera firmly against the base, effectively making it useless. The screw to attach the camera was did not have long enough threads to pull the camera tight. It wobbled like crazy even when screwed all the way in. This was with my Pentax K-50. 
9376 0 Quit funtionjng after a week! 
9377 0 The video sunglasses mp3 Is not working. 
9378 0 They never worked I m so upset, I ve bought different spyglasses and have worked well, but this purchase was sadly a mistake. 
9379 3 Thank you! 
9380 4 This charger is like none other. More powerful than even the product instructions describe. A must have!!! David 
9381 4 Works Great just as it should Thanks 
9382 4 Worked perfect 
9383 4 A lot better than using plus filters. Able to use on all lenses. 
9384 3 so far, so good. came very fast. 
9385 4 Very fast delivery .. It s my husbands 60 th birthday present He hasn t seen yet but I m sure he will be thrilled 
9386 4 Really Handy to get extra batteries. So small and easy to store. 
9387 4 Works as Expected. 
9388 0 Arrived with a broken plastic clip rail, so I had to tape the battery in while it charged. 
9389 4 nice quality, works great 
9390 4 Works as advertised, works fine. The picture above shows the wrong connector, its actually silver and fits fine with the Nikon D3100. 
9391 4 Takes great clear pictures. Takes a bit of work to figure out all the settings. 
9392 4 Super great bag, Solid and well padded. It does come with a shoulder strap. Compartments for other accessories as well. 
9393 4 Easy to use, Very light , all weather functional , nice video quality 
9394 4 Excellent. Just what I needed for the look and feel. See Ba Ba Black Sheep, for yourself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpBifyjcsSE 
9395 4 These work great and price is right. 
9396 2 The motion sensor doesn t work at night, so it won t record until ur literally waving your arms Update: 6 months later The recording device crapped out. It no longer records or functions. New rating would be 1 star 
9397 3 Good camera system 
9398 4 This is the second time I have bought this assortment. Still 110% pleased!! 
9399 4 Great case, hard to keep GoPro protected 
9400 4 It is inexpensive, attaches easily and does the job. 
9401 2 works fine if you want to carry that much weight. the housing where you place the batteries though looks & feels cheap like it can break any minute. 
9402 3 Haven t had to use it. 
9403 4 I purchased this monocular for my husband. He loves it. He only has one good eye so binoculars are not useful. This Polar Explorer is perfect. Also, it was delivered as promised in perfect condition. The price was right. Will definitely use this supplier for future such purchases. 
9404 4 Nice bag, bought it as a gift for my wife for her new camera. Very happy with it. 
9405 3 Fits fine on a my Fujifilm pancake lens. 
9406 0 Not as described at all. Seller did make up for it! 
9407 1 Ok 
9408 4 Hoya filters are very reliable. Have several Hoya filters and have always had great results. 
9409 4 Excellent 
9410 0 The hood doesn t fit properly on my Pentax lens. 
9411 2 I am still trying to figure out why I bought this. It has all kinds of fancy programs that I will never use and some of my outdoor picks haven t captured the detail correctly. Personally I don t leave a camera outside all night to take star pictures. 
9412 4 I use this tripod and phone attachment with my iPhone 6. It is easy to attach to the back of a chair or to stand on a table. It s lightweight and easily fits in my bag with the legs flattened together. 
9413 0 NO WHERE in the advertising did it say for GoPro 3 or earlier models. Does not work with any GoPro 4. Huge disappointment. 
9414 4 perfect for the Phantom and accessories 
9415 4 Good purchase. Same as other more expensive camara, but for way less. I recommed it. 
9416 3 Good camera for the price. 
9417 4 works great 
9418 4 good product 
9419 4 very compact , great resolution for a kit lens, 
9420 0 The frame lasted as long as the time that it was too late to return, 
9421 3 Very well made for the price. Panning is very smooth because they have added grease to it which you can see and slightly hear when panning but that is fine with me. 
9422 4 Great deal, I wanna order more 
9423 3 Unit does what it was designed to do and I like it a lot. Was a bit disappointing with how weak the edge support is, but overall works fine. 
9424 4 Excellent package! Get it!! 
9425 4 Sold to a friend, still work till this day. 
9426 4 It s a great case. I can fit a lot of basic accessories in it. Definitely nothing too long though. 3 way fits in it. The material is good quality. No need to purchase the expensive one from gopole. 
9427 3 Premium price for a good product. I bought the lanyard kit to hold this unit. I feel a fair price would have included the lanyard/ mounting kit. 
9428 0 Too complicated for me. I thought it was Wireless so there would be no wired connections 
9429 0 Only wanted one set of two but must have double ordered as I got and paid for two sets 
9430 4 very nice! 
9431 4 works as described. 
9432 4 We are very impressed with this system. 
9433 4 The Nikon binoculars are excellent. The optics are clear and offer sharp magnification yet is easily handheld for a steady image. Low light performance is great. The rubber finish provides excellent protection from bumps and moisture gives a secure grip. A really great product. 
9434 3 helpful 
9435 2 The tripod is very very cheap. The monopod is fairly good quality. 
9436 4 It fits perfectly in my Pentax K-50 DSLR camera and the anti-reflective feature works fine and now it is easier see the screen without any light glare. 
9437 4 Sony recommended website product for a6000. Fits the LCD screen perfectly. 
9438 4 Timely delivery - they fit 
9439 4 Have wanted these for years now have them can see what I haven t been able to also easier then a telescope 
9440 3 Nice and easy to use 
9441 4 exactly what I needed. 
9442 4 Terrific quality backdrop. Love the fabric quality! 
9443 1 This specifies that it fits the Canon PowerShot SX60---it does not. I m hoping that I will be able to return it but have had no response to my inquiry from several weeks ago. 
9444 4 This is a great, lightweight tripod, for a great price! 
9445 4 Great deal fast delivery, will buy again when I need more, very good quality! 
9446 3 Very useful. A little less on the product material quality but for thw price, it is totally reasonable. 
9447 4 Very well crafted using high quality leather. Good protection and elegant case. A+ 
9448 4 My gf loves it! Get this one beczuase it has bigger films = bigger picture! :D yay! 
9449 3 Good product just have to be careful will fall off some belt loops 
9450 4 arrived in great condition 
9451 4 Convenient, does what it is supposed to do No problems 
9452 4 Excellent waterproof case. Hasn t failed me. 
9453 3 Great functional product but overpriced. 
9454 3 Product was as advertised. 
9455 4 Great Product, Just as Described!!! 
9456 4 I was really impressed with this unit. Very bright. 
9457 4 Loved the product 
9458 4 I love them, and the price was a lot less than what I shopped around for. Thank You. Dotty Shartzer 
9459 4 A good product.. My husband uses when taking pictures for ebay store. 
9460 1 only worked once or twice 
9461 4 Awesome and beautifully colored 
9462 2 The one I received was not silver like the picture but part black and part silver. Was not really happy about that. Should have been all black or all silver. Not a mix 
9463 2 its a basic bag, replaced it shortly after I got it with a pelican case, this is okay for a cheap camera when you need to save space. 
9464 4 Camera and associated app work great. I can control the camera rotation remotely and zoom in. I am also able to call the animals over the two way communication. 
9465 4 Such a cute case I love it so much! Ive had this for a while and it protects my camera. It looks as good as new! 
9466 4 We have mounted these on a car, been in pools and a lake, zip lining, mountain biking and given the pieces some abuse and nothing has broken. Happy with the purchase and recommend. 
9467 4 It works good on iphone 5. But i want one for my Lenovo tablet yoga 2 13 It dosen t work well on the Lenovo tablet and I returned it. 
9468 4 Ok 
9469 4 Used about 6 months. Still works good. Only issue is plug in for Google is no longer supported. 8/2015 
9470 0 Plastic. Cheap. Threw it away. 
9471 4 Got it Fast! All the items were as noted and loving the little tripod :) what a nice set! Totally recommend you will enjoy. Thanks :) 
9472 4 AAA 
9473 4 Works just as described. 
9474 4 Perfect replacement for OEM Nikon caps. 
9475 4 Using these with the Envy strap and Uni-loops. Works great. Quick release function is valuable to me. Have been using this system for 15+years, have not had a failure, very little visible wear. 
9476 4 The best tripod in the price range, you ll get something like this for no less than $300 in another brand, so yeap the best tripod for the money, really solid and usable 
9477 2 Delivery on times, it worked on my Cannon Camcorder ! 
9478 4 Quite clear for a cheap fish eye. Fun to play with. With DSLR video, definitely have to watch out for and overexposure at all, any blown out bits are lost even more so with this lens. 
9479 3 Good item. 
9480 4 DUDE. This lens. I ve gotten so much use out of this little lens. Night shots? No problem. Portraits of your drunk friends? Got it. Crazy cool lighting/bokeh effects. Absolutely. Super versatile lens for a super nice price. Do it! 
9481 3 Very good case, wheels work well, zipper a little sticky in one spot but will work itself out I trust. Not a ton of padding or weight, perfect for stands, sliders and tripods. 
9482 4 Works Great 
9483 4 This is an excellent case. Very strong study construction. I feel secure in knowing this is protecting my expensive equipment 
9484 0 Everything about the description of this product is miss leading. Will not purchase from this seller again. The light does not come with AAA batteries and it is only one light. 
9485 4 Great quality and amazing price !! A small price to pay to protect expensive lenses! 
9486 4 Didn t realize this existed 
9487 4 Worked perfectly on my telescope for alignment and leveling. 
9488 3 It reflects very well. 
9489 4 Awesome so far... A week in, but best camera strap I ve ever own. 
9490 4 Essential accessory for framing pictures with a DSLR 
9491 2 not to shabby, i know this was stupid but if you want this to last please don t take this stick underwater especially salt water 
9492 0 Does not come with flash 
9493 4 Great for protecting electronic devices when you re in electronically hostile environments. 
9494 1 The camera works well enough for the price but the monitor want cut on ..so I just got it hooked to a TV .. 
9495 3 good stuff 
9496 4 Everything exceeded my expectations. My friend really loved it and she was able to shoot a wedding that weekend. Keep up the great work. Will be purchasing from again. 
9497 4 Glad to have them...so useful! 
9498 4 Arrived on time and as described. I never knew what these were for until I took a photography class. Now I have to get a better tripod so I can take photos of moving water and lightening. Now I can take more art-full pictures. 
9499 0 tripod will not hold the camera 
9500 4 Great Product, helps keep all my devices clean 
9501 4 Delivered on time and fits like my original plate. Feels well constructed. Haven t taken it out for any rigorous shooting yet but it s exactly what I was hoping it would be 
9502 0 Rotors broke after first use. Charger cable cannot be decoupled so I haven t been able to charge the copter. 
9503 0 does not work ? 
9504 1 The TTL function on one of mine doesn t work. Didn t realize till after return window was closed. 
9505 4 Great transaction and useful bundle - love the camera! Thanks! 
9506 4 Great kit for flash photo. It creates great atmospheres for your projects. 
9507 3 Pretty rad deal for a great starter pack. Works well and does what it s supposed to do. Recommended. :^) 
9508 4 These are perfect...exactly what I was looking for to clean my screens. They work great and are large enough that they don t bunch up in your hands. A couple of swipes and the screen is clean! 
9509 4 it is a great camera but the lens broke on it 
9510 4 Very Good 
9511 4 It s good!! 
9512 4 I ve used these for my glasses, laptop, phone, and tablet, and I have to say that these cloths are absolutely fantastic. They work well after washing, too! Would definitely recommend. 
9513 4 Works well. I was able to adhere to side panel of window and get closer to the glass, as you can remove the bulky harness from dropcam. 
9514 4 Works perfectly. Kept our camera secure on the dash. 
9515 4 Excellent adjustment range and height for table top use. Very stable and sturdy. This a the best tripod I have ever bought. 
9516 4 Love it! No more losing lens covers! 
9517 3 Great Product 
9518 4 So cool and very amazing camera,I love it sososo much and take many beautiful photos to my friends 
9519 4 Great little camera at a great price, came with factory packing and am very happy with it. 
9520 4 Razor sharp views. Star test best I have seen. I ditched the stock diagonal though. 
9521 4 Love em.. 
9522 3 unit arrived with loose plastic pieces inside. I had to take cover off to discover what was moving aro0und inside. 
9523 4 Works Great, as advertised 
9524 4 Just what the doctor ordered! 
9525 4 super good tripod. especially for the price 
9526 0 Battery not detected by Nikon D5300. It was also slightly thicker than OEM making it harder to install/remove from battery tray. Rapid blinking LED when trying to charge with OEM charger. 
9527 4 Ordered this product for my granddaughter because she loves takin pictures and its time to restock for the school year. 
9528 4 works great thanks 
9529 4 Excelente 
9530 4 using it with my wireless intercom. worked as expected for a great price 
9531 4 Love this case! 
9532 2 Received shipment missing the wall charger. However, the batteries came fully charged and worked well. Returned item. 
9533 4 May not be the cadillac of binoculars but for someone who wants great distance with very good clarity and does not want to break the bank - these are a winner. 
9534 4 Great product and prompt shipment! Thanks!! 
9535 4 I bought two extra cameras to go with the GE Wireless Color Digital Home Monitoring Camera LCD Monitor Security Kit 45255. They paired up great with the reciever. Going to buy a 4th, just to see what our dogs do when were not home :) 
9536 4 Awesome case for the price. Used it for my knife collection. Very high quality 
9537 0 Garbage and really messes with your camera I can t even use it 
9538 1 had problems getting it to thread with my UV filter but after a few tries it fitted 
9539 4 awsome camcorder for the price, easy to use and much smaller than expected, great battery life and well worth buying extra batterys for longer use. if your also gonna take alot of pics with it I found its best to buy a good hd card for good clear pics. 
9540 3 Excellent package. Coming from a Canon to pro Nikon is proving to be challenging.Having trouble with misfires when taking photos 
9541 3 Takes great photos - nothing spectacular - but brought this camera with my on a trip to Venice Italy. Did the trick and if I lost it on my travels it would have been no big deal. My keepsake photos from the trip are gorgeous. 
9542 4 Great camera for price!!! 
9543 3 worked for my basic needs 
9544 4 I bought these to use with my backup release plates. They help to tighten the plate easier. No tools required. 
9545 4 Awesome!!! 
9546 4 Thank you! This came exactly as described, very quickly. Overall wonderful experience 
9547 4 Fantastic little thing. Built well and the head is more secure on it than my legs. Perfect for any tripod without a bowl or other head leveling options. 
9548 4 Great product. Works so much better then others I have tried. I m very surprised that I didn t have any problems.Easy quick and simple.The cloud is kool. You don t need a memory card. 
9549 3 I love this camera pictures are excellent I love my purchase. 
9550 3 Forgot this back in my hotel room so I have yet to field test. Seems to be a quality product so far. 
9551 4 Doubles your battery life. Easy to use and it comes with 4 back doors for new and old cameras. Comes with carrying case too! 
9552 0 poor picture quality not worth it. save your cash. 
9553 4 I can t live without this thing. Looks like Tupperware, works like magic. Love the straps at the base that keeps it from falling off. 
9554 2 Could never get it to work with SmartThings. 
9555 3 I needed a mount that can support a gopro or contour when recording video while driving and this head exceeded my expectation. I was also able to use a Sony A6000 attached to this ball head without fear of the camera coming off the mount while driving. 
9556 3 Works well. As noted previously, a little blurry around the edges. 
9557 0 Dont waste your money 
9558 4 They do what they are supposed to do, also very corrosion resistant. A season in the pool, and they have yet to show any shots of corrosion starting. 
9559 2 Nice build up .value for money.unfotunately its not combatablr with my canon eos100 
9560 4 worked well for NEX 6000 
9561 4 The lens caps fit perfectly and seem to be of good quality. I am satisfied with this purchase. 
9562 3 One notch too expensive (99$US), but its the only show in town that works snug and solid for the lenses used here. Using this with a SONY A7 and things function as well. The lenses work manually fyi those who might not know. 
9563 4 good 
9564 4 More sensitive than expected. Cranky mssg. set up, once set it works. I use it in an area with less shadows from bright windows in the day - that said, because as I said, it is that sensitive. Beat it at the price, I do not think so! 
9565 2 Ok 
9566 4 Exactly what I expected and wanted. Based on others feedback of the savage swatches, I do agree the actual paper was lighter then pictures but it s close. I d say it s just not as rich. Good quality and packaged to support the large heavy roll. 
9567 4 good price and product. 
9568 0 Don t waist your money 
9569 0 did not work need original lamp 
9570 0 too small for the olympus tough TG-860 
9571 4 Got them in only 1 day worked good 
9572 3 Good camera just a bit hard to edit the file format. 
9573 4 works great, delivered quickly! 
9574 4 nothing much to say about this one, it s a lens cap that fits. 
9575 4 The detector installed reasonably easily and has been working very well for the last 2 months. 
9576 0 THIS DOES NOT WORK. Its super cheap, and it doesnt work. At all. 
9577 4 Exactly what I had ordered and expected. 
9578 4 Good! No problems. 
9579 4 Came quick and is fun to use 
9580 0 couldnt get this to work. great design but wont work. 
9581 4 Can t believe how much gear I can get into the bag. I think it will be a great addition to my photographic equipment. 
9582 4 Amazing camera! Super easy to use love it:) came in great condition 
9583 2 it is ok, nothing special. it looks used, was not as new 
9584 4 So cute & fun! We re having a blast capturing memories with this awesome camera! 
9585 3 work ok for my CCTV cams 
9586 4 This case is great to keep up with everything, since the goPro does not come with a case I usually just kept it in a plastic bag and did not have a central place to keep it. So now I store everything together and it is great to travel with. 
9587 1 Well-ordered this battery as a backup for my Sony point and shoot camera. But this little guy just stopped working. Has just over one year. The original battery that I have still works. Will not buy again. Waste of money. 
9588 4 great lens! DOF & low light gem 
9589 4 Great set! 
9590 4 Works well. I use this with the underwater housing and swim with it. Stays nice and tight. 
9591 2 Works well as a trainer for a better quadcopter. Its very fun to use but the camera stopped working after about 2 flights. Looks like it was supposed to take OK video but it broke after an hour of owning it. 
9592 4 cheapest good cable and it works great 
9593 4 very very good 
9594 4 great deal 
9595 4 Works great with my Nexus 7 ii and the phantom 3 pro controller. 
9596 4 Great product at good price 
9597 4 awesome 
9598 0 WILL NOT STAY ON-LINE. DLINK SYSTEM IS HORRIBLE. CUSTOMER SERVICE SPEAKS HARDLY ANY ENGLISH 
9599 4 Does what it s supposed to do. Simple as that. 
9600 4 PERFECT 
9601 4 Everything that you would expect about this waterproof box for the GoPro 3 is exactly as it should be.It s an exact match to my official Gopro case. I would order again if I need another one. 
9602 4 It s good 
9603 4 Excellent item! 
9604 1 Corners match size but sides are concaved and do not fit. 
9605 2 Not ok you can see black parts on the videos and pictures due to wide angke 
9606 3 Great Product 
9607 4 great 
9608 4 I ve used it for a more than a week and it is excellent! Even able to check in while on the road and speak through the camera -- using it for elderly parents as a monitor and it s fantastic. Night time vision works -- all very good. Excellent! 
9609 4 Great product! Very easy to set up. 
9610 4 Good to have a working remote again. Took a second to figure the pairing out, but it works well. 
9611 4 I shoot formal and concert events and this battery worked great for TWO long events (6-7 hours total) and still had power to go. I own 2 of these just in case but I couldn t believe how long this one lasted. Highly recommend!! 
9612 0 Be very careful I ordered this and missed the return date by 1day. This item stop working with in the fist week of use!!!! Only a 30 day return window! 
9613 4 Great camera. The design is improved over the dropcam. Better mount and software. 
9614 1 To small in length in my opinion. Looks weird when you a wearing it. It s just really small and but pops out on your back. 
9615 0 terrible. doesn t fit fuji battery or batteries that came with it, which were both dead. 
9616 4 Brand new in the Canon box. Good and solid lens hood. Great seller. 
9617 1 Don t buy this bag, the straps break easily and it s poorly-made. 
9618 4 Amazing lens, it improves the quality of my pictures and add fantastic effects on them. 
9619 4 Just learning how to use this camera, but so far it meets expectations. Easy to use but has a lot of settings enhance my photography. Perfect first DSLR camera, especially since older lenses from my dad s camera will fit. 
9620 4 This cleaning kit is really good and a great value! 
9621 2 Does the adapter ring come with this kit, if not this is impossible to assemble without it ref; Es-470 lite and soft box kit, I need help Very nice kit 
9622 3 This is a great little camera. The LCD makes it easy to see what you are doing. Only big issues are the battery life, but you can buy a battery pack and double the time. It is fine. 
9623 4 I like it 
9624 3 I think this is really solid, I used it on my vlog - you can see footage of it in use, even underwater: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl-lKaFfe4I 
9625 4 Great camera --- transferring pictures from camera to cellphone or computer is a snap 
9626 4 Very Good Product 
9627 2 It is well constructed.. If you carry a camera and one lens or flash, it would work great. I normally carry two lenses and a flash. The bag is to small for that. 
9628 1 Selfie stick does not fit properly 
9629 4 Reliable 
9630 4 Makes handling longer lenses much easier to handle and when using the video function I can improve how steady I hold the camera. 
9631 4 the best product 
9632 4 Really pleased with it 
9633 3 a pretty good case. I love it. 
9634 0 If the camera lens on your phone isn t in the middle of the phone it doesn t line up. Even if it did work well it isn t worth the price. 
9635 0 Didn t work as advertised, there was no sound and it wouldn t record. Returned for refund. 
9636 4 Very pleased with this product. Up until I got this for my Canon 3ti, I was extremely disappointed in my indoor pictures with this camera. WOW! what a difference this flash attachment has made. Just wished I would have found it a year ago! 
9637 4 Great buy! Hope it holds up 
9638 3 good pics, but didn t realize unitl I received it that it required AA batteries. As result, it doesn t last long with constant use. 
9639 4 A very good middle gray for photography. Great product and got here on time. 
9640 4 this unit works just great, better than the original one I had 
9641 4 Great straps. These distribute the load much better than the straps that come with most cameras and the padding and stretch helps a lot too. Easy to snap on and off as well for tripod work. 
9642 2 It s not universal if the platform is too small to fit even the smallest DSLR. 
9643 4 Not much to say, it works great protecting my new lens and it s a great price. 
9644 3 Great little camera, the only thing I do not like is it sends an alert every time there is moment in the room, however by the time I receive the alert, there is nothing in the room anymore. Trying to get this fixed. 
9645 4 does the job. exactly what I expected it to do. 
9646 1 No útil 
9647 4 Unfortunately overpriced.... but I purchased one and fixed up my Phantom 2 Vision + good as new. 
9648 4 When you have an older camera and you lose cords or other pieces, it can be frustrating to find a replacement. In this instance, it was no problem and this Battery charger is the perfect replacement. 
9649 3 I love them they are very nice 
9650 3 bought it and the problem moved away 
9651 4 Great camera bag pack for a small trips 
9652 4 Used for our cruise and it was perfect! If you have any doubt cast it aside. 
9653 4 Just what I wanted 
9654 4 Excellent body or vehicle cam for the price. Remote and all the mounting accessories complete the package deal. 
9655 3 Slim profile. 60mm+ length is ideal for vertical orientation support. Well machined surface and contours. Construction seems robust enough. A great value when compared to similar QR plates costing 2 to 3x more. 
9656 1 This camera goes through batteries way too fast. It is difficult to change the settings and switch from photo to video, but very easy to accidentally delete your photos. 
9657 0 No memory card in packaging 
9658 0 This lens hood does not fit well on Canon EFS 18-55 mm 3.5 -5.6 lens. Buyer beware. 
9659 2 Extremely tight fit. Had to force it on the flash unit. It works otherwise. 
9660 4 I absolutely LOVE this camera and the company shipped extremely fast. 
9661 1 I reserved the the battery pack and itself works fine but I reserved the baking for a go pro hero 3+ and it does not fit onto my gopro hero3 white housing. 
9662 4 Good Design. Once balanced overall feels good. Very solid construction. Most definitely feels like a durable product. Price is more than fair 
9663 3 Works Fine 
9664 3 Bought a used Nikon Coolpix S3600 to replace a broken point-and-shoot. Picture quality and features are excellent for a point-and-shoot. The only negative I ve found so far is that battery life is average compared to other battery packs for other cameras that I own. 
9665 0 Catch broke off first time I opened it do leg would not extend. It also did not mount camera on the level. Not fit for purpose 
9666 4 Solid construction. Very sturdy and included an extention section to extend it s reach. Works great to hold my camera equipment while working and tinkering with remote cameras and FPV equipment. 
9667 3 Big bag - holds all my gear with room left over. Seems sturdy enough! 
9668 4 Great thin pen, writes wonderful no skipping and the autopoint touch screen end worked on my broken phone screen when my fingers would not do it. I would buy this and give as christmas gifts, graduation gifts or any gift. Highly recommend! © 2015 Jackie Paulson 
9669 3 I really liked the camara 
9670 4 Works great 
9671 1 Nice looking however the batteries we are going through is ridiculous! We have bought rechargeable now yet we are recharging every two days? 
9672 4 Good 
9673 4 Great! 
9674 3 Works fine The battery that came with camera didn t last very long at all. but now I can charge and has a long life. 
9675 4 I like the slik quick release plate system. It is a very solid mount on the tripod even with heavy long lenses and spotting scopes 
9676 4 This is such a great tiny adapter...that works amazingly....Love it and would recommend! It is tiny but it works!!!! 
9677 0 Broke the side door within 3min of opening the package. 
9678 4 Excellent 
9679 4 exelente producto gracias 
9680 4 Perfect, as I expected 
9681 4 These adapters fit the Sony a3000 and the kit lens perfectly. These even have the Sony logo on them, they look exactly like OEM ones I also have. 
9682 4 Was delivered in time it work fine satisfied 
9683 3 Excellent camera for the price takes great pictures! 
9684 0 I did not buy this 
9685 3 I like the camera but didn t came if a book to show me how run the camera plus itthought it came with a card. 
9686 0 This is a very lousy product for the price. The image during the day is to overexposed when recording and the unit itself lasted about a week and a half before it died. For 140 dollars you can get yourself a way better camera than this marked up Chinese junk. 
9687 4 excelente 
9688 3 A very sturdy, lightweight tripod that works best with smaller cameras, and easy to operate. 
9689 4 Excellent. Works well with all my sunglasses. 
9690 1 Too Loud. No Volume Control. Otherwise, works as expected. The lack of volume control makes these useless to me though. 
9691 0 Didn t work -_- 
9692 4 Very strong magnet...stays put and gets the job done... 
9693 4 I love it!!! It fits well with my fujifilm camera and it s adorable. I would totally recommend it. 😍 
9694 4 Perfect fit. 
9695 4 Works great 
9696 3 Nice bag 
9697 4 Does the job exactly as advertised 
9698 4 Good lenses and a great company. I look forward to my next purchase. 
9699 4 Excellent merchant. Items ordered came exactly as listed. ☺ 5 ★ STARS ★ Thanks! 
9700 4 classy and small enough to carry in purse, lap top carrier 
9701 4 Works Great 
9702 4 Fantastic camera. Good quality and comes with a lot more things in the box than my fathers go pro did. Battery life is good and the camera is easy to use. Especially with the remote. I will never buy another helmet cam without a remote like this one. 10/10 
9703 0 it broke the first time I wanted to use it, bad quality. 
9704 4 Worked exactly how it s supposed to. 
9705 4 Good cameras that are VERY easy to install and operate. Great price too. 
9706 4 These products were reliable and affordable. I recommend buying it. 
9707 0 this is a fraud, doesn´t work, dont wast money buying this crap 
9708 4 This reflector/diffuser is perfect. Frame is sturdy and easy to assemble and disassemble. This is quickly becoming my go to lighting tool. 
9709 4 My go to lens. 
9710 4 Replaced the battery in a small cordless screwdriver, and good as new! 
9711 4 affordable and does the trick 
9712 1 Stopped working after a couple of months 
9713 3 Delivery was really fast and the lens seems to work great, but it was not clean and that is the only drawback. 4 out of 5 stars! Thanks! 
9714 4 Much better than the ones I purchased from someone else before. It is also better than the original Panasonic battery 
9715 4 Nice knock-off and good price - can t wait to take it underwater in Cozumel in October. 
9716 4 It fit my lens perfectly!!! 
9717 4 Nest Cam protects my private space/life to a certain extent. Those who prey into other people s life/business are less likely to act ruthless when they know they can be caught in camera. 
9718 4 As advertised. 
9719 4 I love it !! its excellent quality and versatil. 
9720 0 These won t keep a decent charge, won t power anything that has a motor or flash. only good for remotes... very disappointed with them. 
9721 2 Picture quality not so good unable to view objects when digital zoom, picture real grainy at Nite 
9722 4 [[VIDEOID:faa7d83e1f0a9dd702f4f483ad2daa85]] Grip works great for me. Not too heavy but does t feel puny like a selfie stick. Probably best for GoPro sized cameras. I tries to put the Panasonic GH4 on it and it was too big. Quick release works great- no issues with mine. 
9723 4 My GoPro didn t sink. Count it! 
9724 4 Mom loves her 
9725 4 Nice and simple to installed 
9726 3 Convenient way to clean your keyboard. Seems to be pretty effective, at least compared to compressed air. I haven t compared them directly, so I can t say for certain, but this seems to get the job done. 
9727 4 Works perfect just as described! 
9728 2 The program sent with this scanner does not work very well. I have to keep opening and closing it to get it to copy the pictures into my computer. 
9729 3 good product. design needs improvement already broke one trying to unattached it. 
9730 2 It s good enough to give the original battery time to fully charge. 
9731 1 It doesn t zoom in as much or clear enough. 
9732 4 works great, highly recommend! 
9733 4 the package was good it was all amazing 
9734 3 it did the job as decribed 
9735 4 Great product, highly recommended , simple set up and excellent viewing video. True WIFI operation. 
9736 3 Looks like a nice product but the (3-D) part is a stretch. Just a raised bump around the edge from die cutting it. I needed something thicker 
9737 3 Zipper pull was off when it arrived and it is VERY small. I should have gotten the medium size. But this is good for taking a limited amount of accessories. 
9738 4 This was a gift for two young girls, age 6 and 9. The nine year old turned 10 recently and they used this booth and disguises to have for a sleepover and party; I ve been told it was a blast! 
9739 4 Purchased for a friend s D3200, He loves it 
9740 4 Henry at FosCam support was very patient as we worked thru some setup issues. The camera image looks great and I am very happy with the purchase.Thanks again Henry. 
9741 4 The items are great. Unfortunately, I ordered the wrong part number DNS the battery does not fit. I m not sure how to request an exchange. 
9742 4 I have bought several of these wireless IP cams. The Loftek and the Astak. This is by far the best one. Great picture quality, easy set up, DDNS built in so you can view from outside your network. Will by more. 
9743 4 my all time favorite camera. I think it is a little better than the mini *. But it works great! 
9744 4 Amazing package! You ll get everything you need!!!!! 
9745 3 Serves the purpose well. UV cleans relatively easily. CP without distortion but not particularly smooth and a bit touchy to screw on. Haven t used the ND yet. Overall very good for the price. 
9746 0 Very poor Quality 
9747 2 It s great for the price but I ordered black and got a white backdrop. I don t even have time to exchange it so thanks, I guess I need to find another option quick. At least I have a white back drop for future use. 
9748 4 I ve used this item once so far and it seems to be just what I was looking for. Thank you. 
9749 0 Battery never worked so haven t been able to test it. 
9750 3 Great assortment of accessories for Go Pro at a good price. Way cheaper than buying separately. 
9751 4 Looks good, sturdy material and will work well. Looking forward to using it 
9752 4 Excellent product !!! Does the job perfectly, Big enough to picture almost everything, even an open carriage THANKS!! 
9753 4 It s a screw for God s sake, it works as described and expected. 
9754 4 A wonderful product! I love being able to capture portraits of strangers for a project I work on and give them a print as a thank you in return. This stuff is great. 
9755 3 These are awesome. They slide a little rough and occasionally get stuck, but if you have patience, they are well worth the money. If you re just doing a bit of macro shots, don t buy the expensive stuff. These work just fine! 
9756 4 So far so good 
9757 3 Very quick delivery and easy to set up. 
9758 3 wrist strap came off 
9759 4 Great product 
9760 4 We re so pleased with our purchase. Perfect camera bag for our camera, the stands are easy to use and sturdy. Everything in our starter kit is just what we needed.. Thank you again Amazon!!! 
9761 4 The kit is good , but the selfie stick broke the first time it was used. i hope the rest of the pieces last longer than it did. 
9762 4 This camera does a great job. After initial setup, I had to change routers and their customer service walked me through the setup revisions. 
9763 3 Very, very good picture--but a bit slow 
9764 4 Fast shipping and this is an overall excellent camera. 
9765 0 This seller sent me a bunch of useless filters but not the lens cap as advertised. Wont recommend it. 
9766 4 Worked better than I thought and it kept my camera from going to the bottom of my pool. 
9767 3 bit small...but works 
9768 4 excellent value 
9769 4 Cleans me screens and glasses. Can t ask for anything else. 
9770 4 Worked Great. Amazon was the only place I could find a replacement cable. 
9771 3 Very convenience, but the sound is terrible 
9772 3 Solid! A few people complained about set up etc but I think this ting is just phenomenal! I am SUPER happy with the purchase to the point that I keep it in my trunk along with my lights at all times! No extra weight or stand bags needed! 
9773 4 Exactly as described and good delivery time. 
9774 0 I had a similar experience. Although I purchased this camera a few years ago, as a birthday gift for my son, we barely used it 3-5 times. The &#34;on&#34; button does not work, and the &#34;play&#34; button remains lit, but nothing plays as the screen is black. Totally disappointed. 
9775 4 Easy to set up and install. Works perfectly for our monitoring purposes. Highly recommend this product. 
9776 4 The best camera and value package on the market. 
9777 3 I tried several different types of straps and the head strap seems to work the best. The only downside is that when I take it off, I end up with unsightly &#34;GoPro&#34; hair. 
9778 4 My daughter loved 
9779 4 Came fast and worked great! 
9780 3 Really like this kit, but I would prefer for the flat pen to be squared or in triangle shaped as it would do a better job when cleaning both the viewfinder and the LCD screen. Other than that, perfect. 
9781 4 A terrific camera. While physicallly small and easy to use, it is packed full of state of the art features. Extremely pleased with it. 
9782 2 I don t know how I m suppose to rate something if I haven t took it out it s box yet.this why I gave 3 stars 
9783 4 I am very happy with the build quality of this little tripod. Tough, stable. A real tripod in miniature. Fun colors and multiple uses. 
9784 4 Can you tell me how to activate the function &#34;Image size&#34;? This function is currently disabled. Thank you 
9785 4 Great kit for the price!!! Everything fits, nothing was broken, and it arrived quickly!!! 
9786 4 What a great packaged deal! Fast shipping. Have not any problems at all. Phantom is a jewel to fly. Pics and video are superb!! Buy with confidence 
9787 4 Excellent underwater all purpose point and shoot. Camera is easy to operate and takes great pictures. 
9788 4 It is a nice piece of equipment for a reasonable cost! I m a photographer looking to make a transition to video / short films for myself and my clients. Excellent customer service, too! :) 
9789 4 Worked great for GPS units. 
9790 4 Seems to provide the protection I was seeking. 
9791 4 very good I love it. 
9792 0 They simply don´t work. I want a refound. I already tried to do EVERYTHING to make them work, i tried in different areas with different internet conexion. The light always stay yellow and never changes to blue. 
9793 2 They are huge-- listed as compact binoculars, they are anything but compact. 
9794 4 Awesome bundle package. Camera is great and has many useful settings. Easy to use right out of the box. Comes with a wide variety of accessories that are all very useful. 
9795 4 fits the bill nicely 
9796 4 I love this GoPro, and I use it all the time, especially when on vacation down the shore. 
9797 4 Nice 
9798 3 Does the job, creates some great photos. Only reason its not a 5 is because I have a b and w 
9799 3 Good Product Works as expected 
9800 4 Great lens! It rained the day I bought it, so wanted to try out some rain droplet macro shots. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do! 
9801 4 great product 
9802 3 Ok seems a bit flimsy..but ok for the cost...good number of pockets... 
9803 1 Did not work at all. Gave a two star because the return process was easy. The price seemed to good to be true and it was. 
9804 0 I m very disappointed with this strap. It s super cute in the picture and looks long. I got it in the mail and extended it and the tiny black string is so small and is longer then the actual strap. 
9805 0 Didn t work. Don t buy it. 
9806 4 Work great 
9807 4 The camera lens is great. I take a lot of large group photos and this lens is super wide. Picture quality is also excellent. 
9808 1 The product IS GOOD, well made, but it does NOT FIT Manfrotto 501PL Quick Release Plates, unfortunately. I ll try the longer version with less threads on the tip,maybe they work. 
9809 2 Not well made and it take long time to charge. 
9810 0 Don t buy unless you don t mind your SD cards falling out of the slots with the slightest jarring. This won t protect your cards as they get bounced around inside the case. 
9811 1 A little smaller than useful. 
9812 3 Very good for multiple attachments and rigs. Screw slightly loosens easily no matter how tight you make it. 
9813 0 Cheap quality 
9814 3 Very nice 
9815 4 works for me 
9816 4 Great buy ... Works great 
9817 3 I love the Binocular, but what is up with the stupid rain guard on these things? Come on Nikon, it cant cost you that much to include a rain guard that fits. Bought a vortex rain guard and it fits nicely. Everything else is gravy 
9818 0 Inexpensive and the quality shows. I would not recommend this to a friend. 
9819 0 very bad. I did not use it. the power is gone after a week. 
9820 4 Great camera! Replaced an older Nikon model that could not handle newer power hungry lenses. 
9821 2 Just want a listing of whats inside and how to use each item 
9822 4 very nice dvr 
9823 4 Everything came as it is shown. I have not had any problems. I would recommend buying a separate selfie stick, but it works for the price. 
9824 4 very nice! 
9825 4 Wonderful flash. I dropped it (on accident of course) And it s still alive, lol. The output is fabulous and definitely saved the outdoor wedding that got moved indoors due to a t-storm. 
9826 3 Using in Costa Rica now! Great solution to running out of power in the middle of fun. 
9827 4 I bought this little camera for my Grandson and he loves it! It s simple and shoots pretty OK video. 
9828 3 Geat so far. I m glad I bought it. 
9829 4 Seems to be a comprehensive plan at a good price. 
9830 4 Great i recieve my package own time 
9831 1 the lenses doesn t fit, and im so disappointed because thats the only thing in the bandle that im so excited about, it say s for instax mini 8, but its small!!! 
9832 2 sometimes glitches and shows door open when closed, have to open and shut to reset. 
9833 4 Both caps look and feel very durable. Great price for generic replacements, and both fit snugly. 
9834 4 great for the price! 
9835 3 This is a good point and shoot camera for basic needs. There aren t a lot of controls on it, but it does take rather nice pictures. Recommended for simple photography situations that don t call for the need to adjust every last setting. 
9836 3 Works good with my Nikon camera! 
9837 3 Not bad for the price, so far works ok 
9838 4 Never worried about my camera floating to the bottom of the ocean. 
9839 4 good product 
9840 4 Perfect!!! 
9841 4 Great value! It exceeded my expectations. 
9842 4 Exactly what was needed. My son took the camera on vacation; I ordered the adapter and had it sent to their location. They arrived Sunday and it was delivered Monday. Excellent 
9843 4 Great easy to attach to the go pro and it latches it very tight 
9844 4 love it 
9845 4 Long battery life, used one battery continuously for 2 hours and 45 min. 
9846 4 Excellent case! Holds all my FPV racing accessories. And the hard shell keeps everything inside secure 
9847 4 Bought thid for our teenage daughter in addition to the camcorder. She absolutely loves this as it adds a rotating viewfinder to the existing camcorder. Construction is sturdy and installation is super easy! 
9848 4 worked & fit great on our Pentax. 
9849 4 More than happy. 
9850 3 Thanks for the fast shipping and they are so real looking. The only thing is they don t blink red except when I first put them up. I put new batteries in each one also. 
9851 4 great case also 
9852 4 I use the binoculars for birding nearly every week and daily during migration time. The binoculars have great optics are durable and comparable to others that are 10X more expensive. 
9853 0 excellent product. 
9854 4 Love this dash cam! The only thing I didn t like was the set up, but like any dash can setup it is a bit of a hassle. Besides that, it records crystal clear video with useful features that other brands doesn t have. 
9855 4 Great product! Very sturdy and does just what it says 
9856 4 [[VIDEOID:de691885db9775e4f408d9229f84434]]Great tripod product for light and heavy cameras. Working with the company is a delight. A problem arose and they immediately addressed it and sent a replacement. Not only is the product top shelf but the customer service is outstanding. 
9857 4 Works like a champ and it quite a bit cheaper on the wallet. 
9858 2 Need to be an expert to use it. Still working on it. Positive. Gives unexpected result. 
9859 4 Do NOT ever purchase non-Nikon batteries, I did. I will always buy real Nikon. 
9860 4 Sister in law loved these for her new camera 
9861 2 Worked well for the first couple uses and then the calibration got messed up. I suggest getting a small wagon for moving it around, as it is a bit too heavy for my back. 
9862 2 One of the lights will not turn on, I was also missing the camera stand from my delivery. The quality of the product is on point, besides these few hasseles I would buy the product again. 
9863 4 I purchased this T-ring adapter for use with my Nikon D7000. It is a perfect fit and works very smoothly. Great value too. 
9864 3 The camera overall produced excellent pictures and excellent video quality. I don t recommend people with really shaky hands to handle this camera though- Other than that- The price matches the value and I m happy overall with my purchase. 
9865 4 Great for powering field monitor. 
9866 4 Everything that I needed to run my camera with efficiency. 
9867 4 Recommended 100 % excellent product 
9868 4 Absolutely a great value. Takes really good pictures and has great slow motion video that we use for analyzing baseball swings. 
9869 4 These are fantastic. Does the job. Very clear not blurry. Very Very satisfied.....Well built. 
9870 4 nice gift 
9871 0 We actually replaced the first one because it wouldn t update and when we received the second one it wouldn t update either!! 
9872 4 Easy to use, arrived sooner than promised, looks great 
9873 0 didnt fit my canon EOS 5D. Sent back for a refund 
9874 4 Great quality product and even better service, will help support this business for future needs. 
9875 4 Worked as expected. 
9876 4 Received item quickly and love it! 
9877 1 Looked good but I didn t like how the gopro mounted to the pole- I would prefer it to screw in 
9878 4 Excellent product. I love it. 
9879 4 Exactly what I needed. I lost the original, these are great 
9880 4 Arrived quickly! So far it seems to work....just got it today we ll see in about a week or so if it really works 
9881 4 Just as described 
9882 4 For all the stuff this comes with this is definitely worth it. The case is a good size I have the L830 and I can fit more than just the camera :) 
9883 4 Great. 
9884 3 Great 
9885 4 excellent product. 
9886 4 My bolts from my GoPro were easily moved and loose so I got these and they actually give me a better quality video since its not easily getting bumped out of location 
9887 4 Charges the batteries quickly and fully, and the design means it takes up a minimum of space. Came on time. 
9888 4 Great & saved me soooooo much money!!!! I can buy almost 4 of these for the price of one of my Nikon flashes 
9889 4 Loved it 
9890 3 god 
9891 4 Worked as expected. No issues. 
9892 4 Works well. 
9893 4 I like this camera. 
9894 0 Always have trouble with it falling off when I m under water 
9895 4 Henry Was a great help installing my new Foscam camera. very knowledgeable about the system and fast. Totally satisfied. 
9896 4 Too bad it s not a constant aperture! 
9897 4 Wife set up without cable, and very fast connection to wifi network. live video is very smooth. will recommend to friend who wants to buy cameras. 
9898 4 Works great. Use this if you don t need the waterproof housing. Speakers aren t covered either. 
9899 4 Bought these with the Nikon Coolpix waterproof camera. Tried strap out in pool first and it works great. Definitely get these with the waterproof camera. 
9900 4 these have never failed me in the field, unlike some named brand models that cost a lot more 
9901 4 Its was great. Super awesome! 
9902 4 Great for my cine lens 
9903 2 The controls are pretty slow, and I can t get any videos to work, not even .mp4. It s supposed to play .mpeg4, which I think is the same? But since it wasn t super expensive, not bad. 
9904 4 Great pictures and great price. 
9905 4 Great product, exactly as we expected! 
9906 4 Well constructed, strong elastic, good fit- I m delighted with my new bino harness. I wouldn t hesitate to recommend this make. 
9907 3 Good value for a versatile mid-range zoom, complements the Nikkor 18-55mm found in many bundles. Autofocus can be a little slow, but it s fast enough for my general usage. 
9908 4 A bit of work to take apart the devices to program, but once done works very well. 
9909 4 we watched our home movies we hadn t seen in years. very impressed and very happy!!! 
9910 0 Do not buy. 
9911 2 Some of the things are a little hard to tighten down and will need to get an allen wrench to get it tight. The follow focus is also REALLY bad and doesn t work at all. Overall, it s really heavy but is pretty good. 
9912 0 Not good at all 
9913 4 The color of the camera was a bit darker then the picture but I love it! Still trying to figure out which settings work best in the lighting. Love having pictures instantly! 
9914 1 This is one of the worst tripods ever it cant even hold my cameras weight and it contains really cheap materials do not recommend anyone to buy this unless you are in really desperate needs 
9915 0 junk customer service not patient on the phone for almost a hour after getting it up and going soon I hang up it stop working sent it back could not get it to work I m not even giving it one star sucks 
9916 4 Superfast shipping, great! 
9917 4 Great item!!! 
9918 3 I can fit three of these stands in a normal-sized suitcases and still have room for clothes. They are very light and fairly durable. 
9919 4 Great for dental Lester Dine sells this camera for twice as much With a few accessories and &#34;support&#34; It s a rip off from them At $280 it s a bargain!!! I use it for dental photography 
9920 4 excellent product, excellent seller 
9921 4 Great gun mount... Now I can remember what I shoot. Simple but works really well, easy on and off ...but does not move during recoil. Fits on my shotgun and my Rifle. Has not moved, slide, or turned. Absolutely love it. Highly recommend. 
9922 0 These batteries are not worth the price. After shooting about 24 pictures they are dead. I bought these to have extra batteries on an Alaskan cruise. Little did I know I would have been better off not purchasing these. Don t waste your money. 
9923 4 good 
9924 2 Securely holds the camera and it won t slide off your head, but it hurts your forehead after awhile of wearing it. 
9925 4 I purchased the DMC-ZS40S Digital Camera from America Cameras through Amazon.com and was totally pleased with the quick delivery! The camera looks great and I m looking forward to using it. 
9926 1 Almost everything about this is pretty great; the neck stays put, the clamp is super strong and adjustable... but none of that matters since the brittle plastic clip snapped into 3 pieces on the second use. avoid! 
9927 3 Works very well and arrived quicker than expected 
9928 4 Ship faster that expected I would definitely recommended 
9929 0 not at all worth it. do not buy useless product. display quality is very poor 
9930 0 Light is great but they did not ship everything that comes with the light. Missing a vital piece. 
9931 4 Great quality case, perfect for boating, kayaking, and snowmobiling. I use it to keep my phone, wallet, and keys safe and dry. I have tested by swimming down 10ft with the case empty, not a drop inside. 
9932 4 This camera is great! I have not used it much but it has served me well for what I needed and still works. have had it in the water and all good! 
9933 4 Great pictures my daughter loves it 💯!!!!! 
9934 4 So fantastic! I bought this for a wedding, which was full sun and also indoors. It balanced the light wonderfully! Came in small package so it was easy to take in my camera backpack. Would definitely recommend 
9935 4 OEM Smart battery works great and fast shipping. 
9936 0 The included mounting accessories do not fit the GoPro Hero 4 housing. 
9937 4 Holds extras with my camera and it looks really nice 
9938 4 This kit is awesome! It s such a great deal and I love everything it came with!! The selfie mirrored lens is awesome!! The case is great quality! 
9939 1 The films were received some films packages were not working. 
9940 4 Just like the original 
9941 3 works 
9942 0 Not work 
9943 1 I have mixed feelings about this product. Although easy to assemble, the bars are so lightweight that on my first use, it bended, almost loosing its shape. I don t recommended for outdoor use. 
9944 1 Good but too small for a regular size hand and is also not high enough from the camera when mounted on. 
9945 4 Excelente 
9946 4 Very good product! No comments. 
9947 4 Great product, and customer service. Thanks to Henry! Very easy to use 
9948 0 this product does not work for the canon g12 camera 
9949 4 Nice 
9950 3 Very satisfied. 
9951 1 Product works but batteries are have an awkward fit and seem like they have poor quality. 
9952 3 exactly as expected. Wish the body was a little nicer as I would like to do some star shooting but a great first DSLR with lots of accessories. 
9953 2 it s nice off a 3 days ! after oleo phobic Coating start disappear - and all screen cover by smudges ! it s not first time - it s always happens :( 
9954 4 Works perfectly. As expected. This is a must have if you are in need of a quick release for a camera and a Promaster tripod. 
9955 0 Very disappointed with these filters. The threads do not seem to line up properly and they are difficult to get on and off. In fact, the uv filter actually fell off my camera as I was taking a picture over a cliff in Portugal! 
9956 4 This flash is the bOmb, Works insanely well without ever missing a beat from my receivers or off camera, slave or on camera works perfect everytime.. 
9957 0 The cameras were not uniform, some were hard to wind and didn t indicate 0 pictures left. I was not happy with the quality of pictures. 
9958 4 Cheap and works like a charm!!!! 
9959 4 It was delivered rapidly, and I m able to use it with ease. It is lightweight, and that s a plus for me. 
9960 4 Excellence product I would recommend it to all of my family and friends 
9961 0 Well equip will put to use 
9962 4 Use this on my Nikon D3200. Very happy with this flash. Good value. 
9963 4 A+ 
9964 0 Most of these have had good reviews. I returned mine, it would not power on. I would have replaced it, but I found a less expensive one. (I am paying for that now) 
9965 4 Excellent very responsible recommend 
9966 0 Looks fake and has to be eye leaves to work- we have it tilted up on a shelf but then it looks even faker. Very unhappy, especially for the price!! 
9967 4 it worked fine 
9968 4 I bought this set to take my GoPro to a rafting trip in Colorado River at Grand Canyon I wasn t disappointed at all. I used the head strap and it worked beautifully. It was sturdy during all the crazy rapids. Highly recommended. 
9969 3 At the price range, it is a very good deal. 
9970 3 Workable for the price. Never be a rock but a decent stone. Any less than a hundred bucks! 
9971 0 No comment. 
9972 4 Works fantastic! 
9973 3 Used this on a photo tour works very well to keep your free 
9974 3 Fits great over the UV filter that comes with the Phantom, much easier to put on than the gimbal lock provided by DJI. Note: if you are using PolarPro filters, this cap will not fit. 
9975 2 Great service and timely delivery. Tape color matches photo. The tape is not as effective in sticking and holding down cabeles as other gaffers type tape I have used in the past, across differnt products and brands. It does not leave any sticky residue, just as they promised. 
9976 3 It will be great if it can also hold the phone in a vertical way 
9977 3 Great camera, the only problem is you can t see the recorded videos on it without an external device. The strap is garbage it doesn t stay on arm or hand. 
9978 4 love it 
9979 0 Wish I could get a refund. Used in 5 times And still couldn t get it to work right 
9980 4 Good and solid 
9981 4 Works perfectly and the price is right. An essential part of an inexpensive door key card access system. 
9982 0 Stuff didn t come on time and tripod doesn t work with camera 
9983 2 Used it a couple times. Sometimes it takes a few clicks to get it to work even if just connected a few moments earlier. Overall though its nice for group and night sky shots when I can t/shouldn t mangling hit the button. 
9984 4 Very nice lens as expected 
9985 4 I keep my Nikon D600 on it with an extra 80-200mm lens, battery charging in the camera space! If you have more than that you need the bigger size! I will be ordering a bigger one for the times I take everything, but this is a great day pack! 
9986 3 pricey but still ok 
9987 4 Great for travel, fits all of my current gear. Fits all of my lens, camera body and speedlights and other gear. 
9988 4 great shipping and product... works great 
9989 1 the round silicon cover for the naked gopro lens leaves a smudge on the lens that must be wiped off before use after storage. 
9990 1 batteries no good. cheap. won t charged. 
9991 4 Pushes out 8.4 volts... that s all I need. The OEM one is just the same? My concern is the plug end snapping or shorting, however, it is a standard issue plug...MQ172-3SA-CV(50) ... if it breaks. I hope the converter will hold up? 
9992 3 Not a bad setup for the price cameras are pretty good but seem to get a little blurry at a distance of 40 feet but overall system is good for the price 
9993 4 It works great, and I did not have to wait! It even came with a car charger. 
9994 2 OK 
9995 3 Good quality 
9996 3 Rear view mirror is dark. Can use a clearer mirror. Needs a better rewind feature to see previous recording. 
9997 3 Great off camera flash cord. It takes a little effort to install at the flash and camera ends so thst they are pushed all the way into position and locked 
9998 0 It s okay. Not very sturdy. 
9999 4 Took this camera on a recent trip to the UK and it was fantastic. I would highly recommend it. It is light, fast, and takes wonderful pictures. It also holds a charge for quite a while. 
10000 4 Loved it 
10001 2 I put one of these on my Polar on Saturday. I was already lifting and peeling at the corners a couple of days later. Good thing it came with 6 of them. 
10002 3 Very simple to install and operate, cameras are not very clear at night time. 
10003 4 Well built, everything I needed at a great price. 
10004 4 Great item for my GoPro. Give me infinite axes for moving my camera in any direction. Seems to be of good quality. I m pleased with it. 
10005 4 Very professional looking and sturdy. Easy to fold and place in carrier bag. 
10006 3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5P26ImmSzI 
10007 0 Gopro did not work. Headband is of no use to me 
10008 1 It s to confusing to use and it even says it s a video recording device. A waste of 100 dollars. 
10009 3 It works as expected. Cheap and good value 
10010 3 Perfect for the office. I especially like the calendar, no more paper calendar pinned on my cubicle wall 
10011 4 freaking love it..... 
10012 4 Used this to replace an old VISTA15P that came with the house. Came with instructions and latest firmware. 
10013 0 I bought a package of items offered through Amazon. The package was to include a scope, mount and TWO flip back lens covers. I only recieved one lense cover not two. 
10014 4 System worked better than my original - nice refinements in the user interface - the new, Zsight app is great - cameras better clarity, resolution than those of my original, Zmodo system 
10015 4 is exactly what it said it was. Just the perfect size for attaching to my hiking pack shoulder strap. 
10016 4 like original. works perfectly. 
10017 4 Good Seller. Fast Delivery. I am very unsatisfied with the camera. Since first day the external color in one side (on the pool). I managed to keep it safe but ... 
10018 4 Better the OEM. Better price, love these batteries. 
10019 3 Very good set to get started with some studio photography. Items came as described and everything assembled and worked well. I like the carrying case for the bulbs and the umbrellas. It would be nice to have something similar for the stands. 
10020 4 Great product especially for the price! Super light-weight and easy to use. Good quality for the price. 
10021 3 Alright quality but very very cute 
10022 4 Everything was as advertised. Great camera, great experience. 
10023 4 Very nice lens with plenty of zoom. Auto focus work very well. 
10024 4 Just what I needed. Thanks 
10025 4 Tripod is very sturdy. All the benefits of a more expensive tripod without the big price tag. Thanks for making an affordable tripod for the small self-starters out here! 
10026 4 The batteries were very good, hold charge long time. The amperage is better than on the original JVC, but can t confirm this with tests. Overall, good product! 
10027 3 A great little camera, but the menus can be very difficult. Once mastered, and set the way you want it, the camera is excellent. 
10028 4 Looking at old slides to have printed to pictures. 
10029 4 I purchased the film for my babyshower Buying the film was a great idea I placed the camera and let my guest take pictures I have some many pictures and didn t even have to take them myself 
10030 0 Not right one. I ordered EN-EL19 
10031 4 I bought this as a companion gift to go with the camera. It is a really cute set, nicely packaged, and I am sure the 11 year old will love it. 
10032 4 Purchased for my son - he absolutely loves it. Shipping was super fast and item was exactly as described. Thank you! 
10033 4 thank you 
10034 4 Awesome Product! Will buy from them again in the future! 
10035 4 I love this flash. Super well made. 
10036 4 Great camera. Excellent picture quality. Battery life not great but not as bad with the right settings. 
10037 4 Henry was extremely helpful when I had difficulty connecting to my camera wirelessly. Works beautifully now! 
10038 2 Hard to put on 
10039 4 awesome 
10040 4 This is by far the best selfie/tripod stick ever. I have a friend who uses the go pro stick and he is jealous of my CamKix. I would definitely recommend this to any one with a go pro. 
10041 0 Everything seems OK quality, but received a non-functioning 52mm adapter. Seems to be a 55mm adapter that came with it... How did that happen? 
10042 3 Was a gift. 
10043 4 Very nice size and there is room for the extra battery...for my canon sureshot 
10044 3 They seem to run down fast, but there s 10 of them! 
10045 4 dead useful 
10046 4 We love our lens! It takes great actions shots during soccer games and great for scenery too! Thank you 
10047 3 A little bulky but does the job great, doesn t feel like it s going to come undone at all! 
10048 0 doesn t fit the lens. I l have to return it 
10049 4 Arrived fast. Seems better than OEM charger. Battery seems good, too, but it is early. 
10050 4 a must need if u are doing slingshot style 
10051 0 Worthless. The 1st-time ring is not loud enough, and then from the 2nd-time on, it just makes a quite clicking sound that is hardly hearable as if it had not power- but it was directly connected to a power source. Wasted my money. 
10052 4 works perfectly. for the price very good 
10053 3 Works great, but the picture may be misleading. It only comes with the 18&#34;, and not the set of 5 which is on the photo. 
10054 4 small and convenient! light weight and keep your GoPro secure in place. Highly recommended if you only have one GoPro and not a lot of accessories. 
10055 4 I will always buy Wasabi batteries. Very happy! 
10056 3 Does what it should, notify me if someone enters house while we are asleep. Would be nice if the arm/disarm was quieter, but can t expect that for the price. Covers a wide area and triggers over 30 away (max distance across room, could trigger further but could not test). 
10057 4 Being waterproof is the best thing ever. I’ve taken this on the river and dunked it intentionally and accidentally and it’s been marvelously dependable. Love the photo time lapse as well! 
10058 1 Nah... Even as a toy this is too expensive for what it is. For one thing it only works at the highest zoom level because at the lower levels you would start seeing black corners creeping into the picture. At either zoom level the distortion is too noticeable. 
10059 4 Thank you, it is perfect!! 
10060 4 Product was as advertised. 
10061 4 best product 
10062 4 Good size for my cameras, great design, very practical, well built. 
10063 4 excellent product. it was what I was expecting. 
10064 3 Very nice tripod for the $. 
10065 2 AC Adapter died after 1 year 
10066 4 This came in 2 days. Thought I would let people know how to unlock the locking mechanism as some people are unhappy with the product because they don t understand it. To unlock the plunger push down on the metal disc beneath the plunger. This works great. 
10067 3 Works great with my lenses as stated by others when fully expanded and shorter lenses zoomed out it will show up in your shot just collapse to second or 3rd depth and should be fine. 
10068 0 The foscam app will not connect to any of my devices. have lost 90% of the use for this camera 
10069 3 it works very good. 
10070 4 You get what you pay for! 
10071 4 Good Quality and very sturdy. Disregard any negative reviews, they did the job just fine for holing my green screen to the backdrop support system. 
10072 2 Sits by the back door of our cottage. Great for keeping an eye on the dogs, 
10073 2 Should be able to trigger video recording 
10074 4 Takes WONDERFUL photos, and the video is great as well. Get a few extra SD cards, make sure they are Class 10. Incredible ZOOM and super sharp images. I could not have asked for a better camera - video recorder. And you can take stills while it is recording video. 
10075 4 Worked well for me to recharge my camera battery while I was in Vietnam in june. 
10076 4 So very simple to setup and use...well done! We ll be using this under Windows, MAC and Linux but so far I tested it under Ubuntu 14.04 and it was refreshingly simple! 
10077 4 great product thank you 
10078 4 These screw adapters are as advertised. They re well made and fit flush in the machined photography bracket I m using. 
10079 4 Love this lens. Not as fast as some, but it s priced accordingly. Decent build quality and works great for video with the stem motor. 
10080 3 Using for external battery/charger for iPad/phone.. Just fits. 
10081 4 I Love all the X-cel series of eyepieces. I purchased all of them! 
10082 4 Awesome camera. I would give it 6 stars if I was able to zoom in, but nonetheless with 1080 p and 60fps, this is a good camera for all sports activities. 
10083 0 DO NOT BUY!!! Dropcam was great, Google cheapened and ruined it. Dropped resolution to 720, and the network drops off 8 or 10 times per day, even cust.. Support will tell you that nest(Google) ruined their company. Be fore warned, find a different camera! 
10084 2 Powerful but very inconsistent performance, ttl will at some times tend to over/under expose, not very reliable but good third-party flash for the money 
10085 4 Tamron 150-600 fits well with lens hood in storage position. 
10086 3 I like this camera but use something else for night photos. 
10087 4 Same as Canon preformance 
10088 4 Works great. 
10089 0 Setup way to complicated for the average user. 
10090 4 Excellent !! 
10091 4 work Fine excellent!!!!! 
10092 0 This did not fit the battery to the camera I own even though the listing says it will. 
10093 4 Great deal ... fast shipping ... exactly what I needed. 
10094 4 Very good!!! 
10095 4 Original equipment that fits like it should! 
10096 4 Great Product. High Picture Quality. Though Screen Resolution is not that good but Photos are of very good Quality. Fast Shipping. 
10097 4 Nice compact diffuser, easy to install and in testing does a nice job of evenly illuminating a scene. 
10098 0 Thrs no intraction how to use it 
10099 4 Great! 
10100 4 Works as advertised. Just make sure you re buying the right one. Nikon makes two nearly identical lenses with different hood mounts. This hood goes straight on, it doesn t twist on. 
10101 1 Picture quality is poor, no way to save or review video.. only a live feed. 
10102 4 One of the BEST deals I ve ever gotten on these batteries! 
10103 4 Great little camera for the money. It don t record but will take pictures. These pictures aren t great quality but again for what your paying a good value. 
10104 0 it dosent support P2P 
10105 4 Birthday gift for my daughter, she seems happy with it. 
10106 4 Works perfectly to charge our Nikon D-600 camera battery. 
10107 4 perfect price for getting the job done! thank you! 
10108 4 Great product 
10109 4 Doing what it s supposed to do! 
10110 4 Allows for lots of applications. I use it for my band s gigs. 
10111 0 It didn t work 
10112 4 Used many times and am very happy with the compact size and versatility of this tripod. Well worth the cost. 
10113 4 Good product; timely shipping. 
10114 4 If you are looking for an inexpensive, but trustworthy tripod! I could not recommend this one enough! I thought that if I bought something cheap my camera would tip the whole thing over but that is not the case! Definitely get s the job done! 
10115 3 A gift-what was requested. 
10116 4 I am new to whole quad copter and was looking for a cheap quad to learn. This thing is perfect for that and very sturdy. I can t even count how many times I crashed it and it still kept on working. Great bundle and great value. 
10117 2 AmazonBasics 
10118 3 Nice scope, though the tripod doesn t hold the weight of the scope and is useless. Otherwise it s a nice setup. 
10119 4 Works well 
10120 4 The charger works very good with my two different nikon cameras. The packaging was perfect because it wasn t too big, just the right size and it came earlier than i expected so good job Amazon. 
10121 4 Using it on Nexus 7 II. Works great! Good quality. 
10122 2 It s a bit deceptive in size, I m 6 1&#34; and I have to bend over to adjust the Camera. Works ok, but I would need a taller Tri-pod. 
10123 4 Works as intended. Use on my recent snorkle trip and also to simply to hold up my go pro. 
10124 3 This enclosure has a nice finish and strong construction. 
10125 4 Great Product 
10126 4 Does exactly what it says. Simple little product that keeps me organized 
10127 2 just ok 
10128 0 video footage is always grainy and low light no matter what is done to adjust. Big Big waste of money. This is just an overpriced vivitar!!! 
10129 4 Actually my daughter loves them! Got them for her for her birthday. She leads hiking tours and whale watching tours in Juneau, Alaska. She really likes them and they help her spot birds for the tourists. 
10130 4 Arrived quickly and just worked great immediately. This is a terrific tool for the price. Wish the Sony had an infrared receiver on its backside, but this is really easy to use. 
10131 4 Great product 
10132 4 Love all the different clips and straps 
10133 4 Small enough for your pocket 
10134 4 I m using it with the I-phone adapter to record fly fishing casts and it works extremely well. Completely stable and tall for the recording and light and compact for moving and storage. Great value. 
10135 4 Worth every penny! Buy it! Love that the camera compartment can be removed. Leather is awesome and it works great! 
10136 4 Really loud! when your battery is low. I left it on my battery overnight and it only used .01 of a volt in 24 hours 
10137 4 Perfect lens for portrait photos 
10138 4 I purchased for my daughter, she is very happy with the purchase 
10139 4 Of course the day after I ordered this I found the original one, but I did keep this one. I tried it out and it did work and saving it as back up for when I lose the one that came with my fuji camera. 
10140 4 Thank goodness someone is still making these !!!! Thanks ! 
10141 4 Exactly the item I ordered and it came new and box as promised 
10142 0 My blender came without velcrow to attach -_- it s useless. 
10143 1 Camera was very grainy with my security system. Could have been my system but the 800 tvl from this company is clearer. 
10144 4 Nice product. Makes viewing photos easy, can brign them up on my smart phone and send right away. Can also use the smartphone to take the pictures. 
10145 4 work very good days and night can see very clear i recommend it 
10146 0 worst flash i ever used , doesn t work with d7100 in wireless flash trigger mode and the quality of the light in hot shoe is too bad 
10147 3 Works well. 
10148 3 Pretty cool lens, great value for the price. Couldn t believe it actually had metal mount! 
10149 4 A sharp, compact prime lens that does depth of field shots that the 12-40mm zoom lens cannot readily do. 
10150 4 Haven t used it in the field yet but first impression is this is should be included in the box. 
10151 4 High quality precision, travel ease, exceptional overall design 
10152 4 Great I love this I ve had fun with it ever since i got it it also came fast 
10153 4 It works fine. Very pleased. 
10154 4 The mounts we re exactly as advertised and connected to my camera with ease. Good quality and nice clean look. One Mount clip missing when the package arrived, I contacted PolarPro and had a new one shipped to me the next business day. 
10155 4 Guess what - it charges two batteries at a time, works fairly quickly, seems to stop when charged (when I forget them in the charger they never get warm). That s what I was looking to buy....would buy this product again. 
10156 4 Works well 
10157 3 the design is cute, I just wish taking it out and putting it back in was easier since i have to take it out to check the amount of film i have left and to replace the film and batteries. 
10158 2 Did not blink after installing new batteries. Tried another set of batteries, same problem. I looked at the camera during the day and night several times 
10159 4 I have found this back pak easy to load/configure and is quite versatile. It is easy to carry and offers good protection for the contents. 
10160 4 Perfect fit. The lens I had bought should have come with one of these, but for the price it fills the bill. 
10161 4 Good 
10162 0 Didn t work consistently. Had to return. Thank you Amazon for a wonderful return policy! 
10163 4 I love this perfect size tote for my DSLR and nifty fifty. This way I ll never miss a moment. Very roomy for keys, cards, and phone. It s also stylish which is the less important use, but it s definitely a perk plus. 
10164 4 Works just as good as original battery. 
10165 4 Very handy backpack, nice size. All my camera gear fits, along with chargers, notebooks and iPad. 
10166 4 they worked great. 
10167 4 Works very fine so far. Attaching strings should come in very handy for people like me. :) 
10168 4 this is a great drone for beginners! worth the price for what it is! controlled by an app for your phone! buy extra batteries and props with this product 
10169 4 Could not have ask for more , great deal everything as discribed. My only problem was self created. Ended up buying a camo cam could have used a better shoulder strap But this product was everything that I expected and more. Great seller, quick shipping. 
10170 0 The selfie stick is cheap not worth it in my opinion. The other gadgets worked fine 
10171 3 Works great and I got them at a discount compared to local stores. 
10172 4 This product is amazing and at very low cost. Most importantly, the live customer support was extremely helpful in solving a problem I had in getting all my cameras recognized. Very special thanks to Alan ( badge id# AR004639) at D-Link Customer support (877) 595-6935 
10173 3 This is the perfect tripod for carrying inside my small camera bad. It opens and collapsed easily but locks into position when the legs are extended and given a small twist. 
10174 4 Best sensor cleaning swabs available. 
10175 3 Is it a nikon battery? NO. Could I tell the difference? Not really.. I am skeptical of off brand batteries but this one is just like OE, for 1/3 price. Used in D800, and performance was comparable/identical to nikon batt. 
10176 3 Good Deal! 
10177 4 Had me excited to shoot again 
10178 4 Great camera, use it to keep an eye on my dogs while I m away at work. 
10179 4 Wonderfully exposes image with good dynamic range. Even though a lower resolution than my other cameras, the picture looks far better due to better exposure, dynamic range, and colors. Lens is distinctly wide angle compared to my other cameras, too. 
10180 3 As others say, rubber on product smells like toxic waste, after washing ten times, spraying it with armour all, I can stand it. Nice product if it were less toxic. 
10181 4 So happy to have an extra battery since our other one kept dying on vacation. We ll get a lot of use from this. 
10182 4 Kit arrived on time and was exactly as described. Very happy with experience. 
10183 4 This lens is fun to use although I still keep my other lens handy. I am satisfied with the quality and value for the price. 
10184 2 Lot Heavier then expected. 
10185 4 So far great! 
10186 4 A very simple review: this is now the only GoPro mount / accessory I take with me when I m hiking, biking or on the water. Versatile, simple, reliable. Excellent. And handy as a tripod too. 
10187 4 Very good! Thanks 
10188 4 This quadcopter is the most fun I ve had for under $50 in years! 
10189 0 Stay away took 12 hours still won t able to fixed 
10190 2 doesn t fit if you have the lens hood in place unlike original 
10191 0 too small to use 
10192 4 Works with my d7000, v1, and d70 (and i assume the rest of the nikon lineup), and is cheaper than the nikon version. 
10193 4 Great product. I am very satisfied of the quality of the pictures. Soo happy to have the camera definitely purchasing again. 
10194 3 Very good camera strap with the ability to quickly disconnect the strap from the camera. Just what i needed. Good quality at a very good price. 
10195 4 Works great, small profile. But... You must have camera shutter set to timer/remote mode first. Instructions fail to mention that. 
10196 0 Soooo cheapy, we went to extend it and one of the poles came all the way off, one wouldn t open (stuck inside tube, tried to remove it with tweezers but it bent--- with tweezers!) very low quality, don t waste your money! 
10197 3 Not a bad deal. 
10198 4 I really like the case perfect size perfect color 
10199 0 Not suitable for a 6 individual. Sling strap when adjusted to max length is too short. Camera rides high (under your arm) and cannot be raised for shooting because of the short straps. 
10200 4 easy to configure! 
10201 2 its ok 
10202 4 Nice backdrop! 
10203 3 Super helpful! Used it for my camera and sure enough, works great! :) 
10204 4 Awesome camera. I am a dslr user and needed something to replace my huge amount of gear. Resolution is what I expected but of course not as high as my Nikon d800 s But definitely a fun and powerful camera in terms of performance. 
10205 1 Sometime it will not work 
10206 4 Great product. I will continue to buy Olukai for all of my sandal needs. 
10207 4 I waited to write a review until I used this product for meany months, its fantastic and illuminates my light box fantasticlt!!! Absolutely fantastic packaging and everything came fast and works great!! 
10208 3 Holding up well. 
10209 4 It is an awesome product! Sets up easy and has a great carrying case. I love it!! 
10210 4 A must have for your telescope. 
10211 0 vibrates way too much to use for camera 
10212 3 Camera still doesn t work. Don t know if it s the cable or camera 
10213 4 Very versatile. Easy to use. Finally can take family photos without accosting a stranger... 
10214 0 Buy a go pro instead 
10215 4 Cool 
10216 4 This works very well. 
10217 4 A++++++++++++ Thank you !! 
10218 4 They are perfect for a cell phone, tablet or eye glasses. They get all the fingerprints and oil off without a problem. 
10219 3 Easy to use; good pictures 
10220 4 I use this unit with my Nikon D60 DSLR and it works perfect. No problems and less expensive than the Nikon counterpart. 
10221 4 excellent service the Bobber works really well in the water great product 
10222 4 This is a wonderful case, I loved it so much that I bought another case that was just a bit smaller. They are both very strong and practical. This is a great tool and I m happy that I purchased these. 
10223 4 Easy to use 
10224 3 Works as expected, and much cheaper than the GoPro brand one. I only wish it somehow floated right side up... 
10225 4 This works well, turns off when done, and the price is right 
10226 4 These things are a blast and cheap enough so it really doesn t matter if you destroy it.. Yeah they are very durable Also found that if you want to fly it outside, push in on the left stick, makes it more aggressive. 
10227 4 Works well with small camera at the beach. Seems to be well made. 
10228 3 product as advertised. 
10229 2 There s nothing really special about it but it will get the job done. I wish there were cuter, more stylish options for DSLR sleeves but it is what it is. 
10230 2 It works as expected. 
10231 4 Very helpful 
10232 4 Other than one brief Bluetooth dropped connection, this selfie stick performed flawlessly on our recent trip, in both cool and hot, humid conditions. Definitely a solid, affordable purchase! 
10233 4 It works and I like it. Cheap in cost, but feels sturdy. 
10234 1 Had some problems with it. I usually use my Nikon D-5100 but thought I wanted a smaller camera that I could carry easier. Guess I expected the photo quality to be the same as the digital SLR but was disappointed. However, Amazon let me return it without any hassle. 
10235 4 Awesome high quality product. It said USED with cosmetic damage but its not noticeable I used it for all of my Music Videos. Youtube Search: Jeremy Crescendo 
10236 3 Excellent Product. 
10237 0 Not for original go pro 
10238 3 I love this flash. So excited to finally own one. 
10239 4 I have yet to have an issue with it after a few months of owning. Taken hundreds of photos with it thus far. No complaints. 
10240 4 Nothing better than these. Recommended. 
10241 4 Works great. Always good to have plenty standby power and charging 2 at a time makes it much quicker. 
10242 0 really hard to get a signal. A waste of money 
10243 4 Works well - very satisfied with Amazon transaction/service. 
10244 4 I was very pleased with this product. Was a little worried that wouldn t actually be compatible with my camera but everything worked really well. Thanks. 
10245 4 Used these to clean the inside of my windshield to get rid of that weird haze that builds up. Worked perfectly. Hard to handle in that situation, so I wrapped them around another towel so I could grip them better. 
10246 3 The selfie pole is flimsy but overall there are plenty of attachments for great angles. 
10247 4 The best way to take your GoPro out on the water. 
10248 3 Allows me to charge three battries at once when I use the power adapter. If I try to just use USB - will only charge two. 
10249 4 Works great! Speedy shipping 
10250 4 All good stuff,, but the packing really bad!! Card boar was tear,,, n weak!!! 
10251 4 Came quick and works great. 
10252 3 Really like the camera, the lense size is double what we expected. Picture and video quality is amazing. Very confused by the fact it s made for European outlets though. 
10253 3 This camera has served me well for a long time. I would recommend it to anyone wanting a good quality, no nonsense camera. 
10254 3 Very good quality, I m pleased. 
10255 1 So, ordered the standard housing 2.0, but unfortunately received the dive housing 2.0. Did not even realize this until I was already on the dive boat today. Will update product review once proper product is received. 
10256 4 Excellent quality! Very happy with the purchase! 
10257 4 Great product. As advertised and of super quality.... 
10258 4 exactly what i expected! i love this set and i definitely recommend it. 
10259 4 Best Charging System for all GoPro batteries including other manufacturers. 
10260 3 Great Value! 
10261 0 These dont even hold a charge as lonh as my original 2yr old battery 
10262 4 It s a cheap lense hood that fits well and gets the job done, not much else to say. 
10263 4 Perfect Fit! 
10264 4 Started looking for a camera I liked with a good zoom lens 5 years ago. This camera is exactly what I was looking for. Glad I waited. Love this camera! 
10265 4 Great accessory bought two :) one for me and the other for my daughter in law :) 
10266 4 Excellent product. I solved a problem with a camera at nights. 
10267 4 Great item works great!!! 
10268 4 I love my new iPad. It is easy to use. 
10269 4 Will return to seller. 
10270 4 Works great. Charges 2 batteries at the same time. Like all great devices it uses a micro USB. Very pleased with this product 
10271 3 Great for the price! 
10272 3 LOVE LOVE LOVE!! Camera is Excellent and my husband loves it all!! 
10273 4 Fast delivery, Items exactly as described. Good place to purchase your add-on s for camera security. 
10274 2 i have other cheaper ones that works as good 
10275 4 Ain t nobody got time for expensive go pros. Go cheap and buy more. Works great can t complain and for the price it s insane. 
10276 3 The underwater pictures are better than those that are not. Resolution is low - but bought it for them to rough around with. Will buy nicer one when they are a bit more gentle with these things. 
10277 4 Fits my camera perfectly 
10278 4 will USE THIS RECOOMEND THIS 
10279 1 The remote doesn t work with my Canon Rebel t3i EOS 600D 
10280 4 Very nice portrait lens good price and fast shipping 
10281 4 Works great 
10282 4 best bag for short travel 
10283 3 Purchased this as a gift and the person loves it! 
10284 4 Worked great. Fits my hero just fine and is water tight. 
10285 4 Everyone has a plan till they get punched in the mouth. - Mike Tyson 
10286 4 great started drone, good price, high quality. 
10287 3 Works very well makes it handy to do angled shots. 
10288 4 Works great, good price. 
10289 4 thank you 
10290 4 Camera works amazingly; takes great photos, although the quality of them varies a bit in low light. 
10291 3 Charger works great and is simple to use. 
10292 4 What a great camera! Because of how I have my home wi-fi set I had to use their customer service. Wow is the only way to put it. They were very responsive and offered the highest level of service I have seen in a long time. 
10293 4 I haven t used the flash as yet, but I have demonstrated it in practice It works as well or better than the ones costing 5 times as much 
10294 3 Higher capacity than original battery, and support all functions. Charged it fully, so lets see how long it can last and hold a charge. 
10295 4 I was worried about ordering any electronics from online, but I had nothing to worry about. It was excellent condition!! Works beautifully and gets the job done!! LOW priced and fast shipping!! Feel safe when ordering from this seller!! Thank you!! 
10296 4 THE YN600EX- RT FOR MY CANON 70D PERFORMED GRATE, I DID A 60th BIRTHDAY PARTY THIS PAST WEEKEND WITCH RAN 7 HOURS AND THE FLASH WORKED GREAT I USED MOST OF IT S FUNCTIONS. IT PERFORMED JUST LIKE THE CANON VERSION ONLY CHEAPER. 
10297 4 Best film ever made; now it s about the only film made. 
10298 4 Does what i need to do perfectly! I bought this camera just to start making youtube piano videos. For an &#34;entry level&#34; GoPro this is remarkable! Check out the video I made with it! https://youtu.be/c2IH5HMuC5Y 
10299 4 best way to shoot macros! 
10300 4 Did the job 
10301 4 These guys are the best! Shipped case super fast, and it is a great product! 
10302 4 Received as described and prompt shipping. Great price and high quality. 
10303 1 Looks good. That s where the goodness ends. Boom arm to pole connector does not really hold: loaded, the whole construct slips. Consider looking elsewhere. PS.: while not excluding a &#34;crooked hands&#34; factor, this particular design does not work for me. 
10304 4 Exactly what was advertised. 
10305 4 I just received it,hopefully it will be fine 
10306 3 The lens is pretty darn good. Almost the only one you d ever need considering the iso range available on the unit. Still figuring out the rest of the settings 
10307 4 My friend told me that her husband loved these pajamas! This is what she said he wanted for Christmas. She loves that they are so soft. They were given as a Christmas gift. 
10308 2 Ok for price 
10309 3 Straight from the mother land (China) 
10310 2 Requires a VERY high internet speed. My DSL was maxed out and it still did not function. 
10311 4 Best purchase I have ever made. 
10312 4 Just what I needed to get my laptop to talk to my Nikon. What is that funny little Nikon connector called anyway? 
10313 4 It is so much more substantial than the one that came with my camera...Fits better and is made sturdier. 
10314 0 I only received two lens not three. 
10315 3 very nice, I bought it to have in different places in my house car and my husband took few to his office i just wish they were a bit bigger. 
10316 4 I love it. 
10317 4 Awesome 
10318 0 lots of problems, wouldnt buy it again. 
10319 0 You have to charge this thing everyday...complete waste of money. First item arrived damaged, return was easy but still not worth the money. Going to be putting into the trash. Only recordings I have gotten are when I first place it onto the wall. 
10320 1 Bought this for my 12 year old niece as her first digital camera. This camera takes crappy pictures 😕. Not worth the purchase. 
10321 4 A very nice product. 
10322 4 Love it! 
10323 4 Quick & easy setup. Just be sure to plug it in to your computer FIRST, then plug it into the wall outlet. This is my second camera. I am going to order a third. One for home & two for business. 
10324 4 I love it so much I never expected to run out of film so quickly ahaha 
10325 4 love this backpack holds a good bunch of gear fits well to wear and the laptop area is great 
10326 3 Gave this as a gift for a fellow photographer. She loved it! I wonder if this name brand is as good as the other manufacturers... 
10327 4 Great product! 
10328 3 ok 
10329 4 fits nicely into the pack. 
10330 1 Motor and gears break easily. Must order parts online. However, they are easy to replace. My son loves the copter. 
10331 4 I m very happy with this product! 
10332 3 Exactly as advertised 
10333 3 Looks like the real deal. Love it. 
10334 0 Sorry- had to return it. Much too small for a 50mm full frame lense. 
10335 4 I gave it to a friend 
10336 4 Awesome Handle! About the cheapest you can buy from anywhere and it s built VERY well. 
10337 4 Really happy with this purchase, amazing camera for a reasonable price. I don t use everything from the bundle but it was a great deal. 
10338 0 Not well ventilated. 
10339 4 very good 
10340 4 Good item 
10341 4 Excelente producto!!! 
10342 3 Seems to work perfectly with the Lee Holder and my 105 mm polarizer. Good quality, and while it costs much less than the Lee, it is still overpriced. Lee products, but especially their accessories, are CRAZY expensive. 
10343 4 Get it out of the box and you are ready to use it. Just synchronize, via Bluetooth your phone, and you have your shutter working. 
10344 4 Nice camera easy to use and get started quickly 
10345 0 Does NOT do anything 
10346 4 very useful for outdoor carrying 
10347 4 Outstanding product which does exactly what it says it does. I purchased these cleaning cloths strictly for cleaning my eyeglasses because I don t care for the smaller cleaning clothes. So, my 2 concerns were (1) cleans glasses well and (2) adequate size. These cleaning clothes met those 2 concerns. 
10348 4 I love it. Very comfortable, durable, and for the price is amazing I managed to attach it along with my neck band and use both actively. 
10349 4 A little flimpsy but works pretty well 
10350 3 Very easy to use and takes terrific pictures 
10351 4 Great buy and great company 
10352 4 Husband loves it. He said he wont use everything but atleast he has it when he needs it. 
10353 4 Perfect 
10354 4 Quite sturdy. 
10355 3 This is a great value if you need to record a long segment. It s crazy that it even comes with a cigarette adapter, which I doubt I ll use. 
10356 0 Suks 
10357 2 I will do the job.. not the best tripod but for the money it s good enough for my purpose’s. 
10358 4 Loving this camera!!! There was a mix up with the flash, but Photo-4-Less was quick to respond to our request for a replacement. Waiting for it to arrive. 
10359 4 This was a great deal. I only needed the charger (I lost mine) so getting the two batteries with it was a bonus. The charger works great. The shipping was really fast too. I had it within just a couple days. 
10360 0 Broken product was not what I expected to be 
10361 1 poor image quality 
10362 4 Nice product at a reasonable price. 
10363 4 Bought for my son s Go Pro because his somehow broke. He loves the color and is looking to replace whatever he can on his GoPro case with parts of the same color. Recommend. 
10364 4 Love this sports cam it s so clear and love how it works on wifi, to me why spending 400 on a go pro when this one can do the same to me even better, thank you for giving me the opportunity to get this product in exchange my review 
10365 4 Works great with Nikon D3300. 
10366 4 Great screen protector for camera LCD s. This product is easy to size and apply to the LCD screen. It holds fast but can be removed without leaving a residue when it s time to replace or change it. 
10367 4 It works. What more can you say. 
10368 4 Awesome 
10369 4 this is the perfect case for my camcorder its sleek, comfortable and I was able to fit all the accessories into it and still have room left over for id or credit cards. I love this case 
10370 2 The camera looks just like the picture, but I am a bit disappointed in the way it does not focus well when zoomed in from a distance. Also find the transfer of pics to phone a little cumbersome and slow usually. 
10371 2 With every shot from a 12 gauge the camera would move completely out of the way or at one point even managed to fly off. But good for fishing and other random projects. 
10372 1 It needs more compartments to put the accessories in. 
10373 4 Best beginner quad out there!!! 
10374 2 nothing to write. It comes with hardly no instructions or service manual. camera have a narrow scan width & it will not take a sata hard drive smaller than 500 GB. Sorry but I would not purchase another one. 
10375 4 The charger does what it is supposed to do. We are happy with that and that the price was right. 
10376 0 did not work. I have to return item. 
10377 4 I m a photographer and I love these. Great 
10378 3 Great Camera, bought for my 12 year budding photo journalist. She can t wait for school to start so she can help with the school yearbook. 
10379 4 It s excellent product I really like it 
10380 3 The housing can go with thwe other compllement for the tripod 
10381 4 As described. 
10382 3 Works as described 
10383 4 great. 
10384 4 This is a superb lens, and a very useful macro. 
10385 4 I was pleasantly surprised when I saw how big these are. There are six individually packaged cloths, so you can share them if you want, I intend to buy more for stocking stuffers. They work great and are easy to keep clean. 
10386 4 fast and sharp. Great quality. 
10387 4 Absolutely love this camera! The color quality, sharpness and quickness in capturing the images surpassed what I expected. It s worth every penny. The instant gratification of having the photo and sharing with friends and family is totally special. 
10388 4 Nice little lens. This does everything i need it to do. 
10389 4 Excellent gear, very well crafted! The grip for the camera is a little flimsy though - Go with this grip in this package instead. Great combo. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00S4NB2IY/ 
10390 4 Just what I needed. 
10391 4 Love my new camera!! 
10392 4 as described. Thanks! 
10393 4 Danny was excellent at fixing my camera. I do love my camera. 
10394 4 works great and great price 
10395 4 Does exactly what it is designed to do...Works great for me 
10396 1 Panasonic FZ series is so much better. I had high hopes for Fujifilm but they do not compare to the clear and sharp images of Panasonic - even if you go back a few model years. 
10397 4 Nice case and extremely sturdy. Doesn t quite accommodate the remote for the phantom 3, but 5 minutes with a knife on the foam solves that. It s a big case but between the remote, phantom, power supply and two batteries it gets a little tight. 
10398 4 Great! 
10399 4 Fits my Nikon with 18-200 zoom perfectly. Plenty of extra pockets to carry other essentials. Love it! 
10400 4 Holds like iron. Pleased. 
10401 4 I purchased many sets of camera straps from OP/TECH USA, and finally this one met my expectations in terms of strap length because I prefer to carry my camera over my shoulder and I don t like to hang my camera from its bottom but from its eyelets. 
10402 4 Keeps items inside safe and dry. Case is durable and feels solid. Usuale pelican quality. 
10403 3 Works as promised 
10404 0 I just got this product and it s not charging I m so disappointed hope will refund my money soon 
10405 4 I used this for a time lapse sequence on my old D70s. Worked just fine. The customer loved the sequence used in a commercial spot. 
10406 0 Shotty. Didn t work 
10407 3 great product. I d rather it had a len protector included. 
10408 4 a must have 
10409 4 EXCELLENT!!! 
10410 3 Nice lighting. 
10411 4 Using a variety of leica camera R8,M6ttl, digilux, T series and monochrome this unit good with all. Along with leica tripod proves very useful. 
10412 4 Batteries work well and charge fast, no complaints. 
10413 4 Works well, does a good job protecting the glass. 
10414 3 Like it for a small bag. 
10415 4 works great for my motovlogs no problems at all 
10416 4 Don t buy the cheap mounts. Buy the GoPro original. It s worth the additional cost. I rode over 2300 miles on my Harley with this attached to the front fairing and it worked great. 
10417 4 bought this for my wife. She absolutely LOVES it!!! 
10418 4 Fits well, although it isn t reversible on my tamron lens, I suspect it may be on other brands. 
10419 4 my brother will like it thank you 
10420 4 Great kit with accessible price. Definitely would recommend it! 
10421 4 Great; strong, reliable, compact easy to set up/break down...what more could you ask for. 
10422 4 I m giving this 5 stars because my boyfriend likes this. I bought it for him and he seems to be pleased with the way it is working. 
10423 3 I love it however it is a little bit tricky to get off. 
10424 4 Great！ 
10425 4 I own 2 of these and they get a lot of usage in my business. Very good quality. I swapped out the traditional 3 position heads on my Manfrotto tripods and now use these exclusively. 
10426 4 As advertised. 
10427 4 Fast shipping and fits perfect on our Sony camera 
10428 4 love this background, it photos really well. I use it alot 
10429 4 Fits the lens perfectly and adds some scratch protection for the front of the lens. 
10430 4 Was in the market for something affordable and useful; this product provides both! As a new photographer I am very pleased, and recommend to anyone who is starting out! 
10431 4 Charger worked perfectly with my camera battery. Have not used the car charger yet, but so happy to have one while traveling. 
10432 4 Works great 
10433 3 The case itself is quite small. I had expected a bit larger. But it does hold my enough gear for my ski or boat bag. Pros: good construction, enough space for some gear Come: quite small If you need a small gopro session case this is for you! 
10434 2 Way too many features to remember how to use them. As a point-and-shoot camera it isn t ideal. 
10435 4 Absolutely outstanding 
10436 4 Worked as describe would get it again if I needed it. 
10437 1 Charger has bad ports, will kill batteries charged there. Was good for a little while (4-6 months?) but then it killed batteries. It took me a while to realize it was the charger, not the batteries failing. 
10438 4 Easy connection (Android), images are clean and color true for a little portable printer. Zink paper cost is reasonable. 
10439 4 I can no longer live without my Benro. I love it. 
10440 4 So enjoying this selfie stick for my videos and for photos! 
10441 4 This works well for my Ebay pictures. 
10442 2 This will only fit an iPhone without a case. Too small to hold iPhone with case. 
10443 4 came fast, good price, thanks! 
10444 4 Good product and a fantastic seller A++++++ 
10445 4 Innovative! Does what it says. Convenient, compact. Also useful to diffuse light for macro shots. 
10446 3 It was just what I expected and needed 
10447 4 Quick turn around. What I expected! 
10448 4 Thx 
10449 4 This backpack has tons of room for all my camera and accessories. It s well constructed as well as padded. A bit I n the big side but still comfortable to carry. 
10450 4 Bought this for my grandson that turned 13 and it is prefect for him. A great beginner camera and easy to use. 
10451 4 I ve had this charger for many months now and continue to be satisfied with the operation. 
10452 0 I used it less than five times decided just stop trying. It was so hard to figure out what I was hearing. I wish I used it sooner so I could get my money back. Don t waste your time and money on this device! 
10453 4 After looking everywhere for these batteries, my dad lost hope that he would find batteries for his Canon DSLR camera. When I heard him lamenting about this, I suggested that I look on Amazon. Voila! Problem solved! Thanks for making my 90 year old dad a happy camper. 
10454 3 Everything it s supposed to be 
10455 3 Works great with my Panasonic HC-W850K Digital HD Camcorder 
10456 4 A very handy lightweight pack for a single lens and camera and accessories. 
10457 1 Not happy at all! Drops control link sometimes less than 10 meters. I find it not reliable at all. 
10458 4 This works perfect for my Canon SX530. An excellent product. I recommend it highly! 
10459 4 as described. Works well on my camera. 
10460 4 I love my camera! I keep it in my purse! I never use my big Canon anymore! 
10461 1 To be completely honest, the item was flown one time and already needs replacement parts Not very happy with the robustness Of the product. Easily broken. Will be contacting the company for answers and replacement parts. It does fly ok. Very touchy controls. 
10462 4 Small size recharger.. Working excellent.. Battery also good.. 
10463 4 Good product. Arrived promptly as promised. 
10464 4 I love my new camera. It s a beginner photographer setup. Memories in the making. 
10465 0 I bought this as a combo for the infinity portable speaker and it didnt fit the damn thing 
10466 3 Nice quality especially for the price. Would definitely buy other colors. 
10467 2 The fact this doesn t turn off is my only score against it. It s also a bit confusing to use, but not difficult to learn. Works great. Would prefer a wireless version. works with my D7100 
10468 4 Perfect 
10469 4 great! 
10470 4 I have used LensPens since my first DSLR a Pentax *ist DL back in 2006. They work great on my lenses and haven t caused any scratches or issues. A quick and painless way to clean my lenses. 
10471 4 Excellent product. 
10472 4 No problems here! This is the backup battery for my Nikon D7200. It charged up quickly as I expected and lasted as long as the battery that came with the camera. 
10473 4 Lost my original Nikon charger. This one works as advertised and comes with a vehicle charger attachment. 
10474 0 This mic was the reason I kept getting error messages on my 70D. Didn t have time or patients to trouble shoot it. Sent it back. 
10475 4 Great Price, works great 
10476 4 Holds everything except the kitchen sink. Works great! 
10477 4 Great! 
10478 3 It cant be support a big camera. 
10479 4 Love it 
10480 4 This is one of the best lenses Canon makes. If I m shooting outdoor portraits, this is what I reach for. 
10481 3 so far it has worked as expected. 
10482 4 Cheap and works perfect for semi-pro activities. 
10483 4 Thank you for the material of the order, everything went well with the delivery man 
10484 3 Nice camera!! I m very happy with my camera and the teleobjective of 300mm but the rest of the material is not worth it, the quality is bad. 
10485 4 AMAZING! In love with it.. soft, comfy, stylish. :) 
10486 4 works great!! 
10487 4 classy way to offer a days shoot to friends,clients, family members 
10488 4 Just what I need for my 1st Aid kit 
10489 4 I have been in love with this camera since I got it. I m still learning the advanced functions. 
10490 1 Item is broken. I guess I ll be using super glue since it s not worth the hassle of returning. 
10491 4 Great lights, would highly recommend 
10492 4 Easily connects and works so well! Very easy to carry around. 
10493 1 Cheap, broken, this sums up what this tripod is all about. Doesn t matter where you get it you will find the same. Shame on you Targus. 
10494 3 Had an odor but is a great deal and great way to keep camera safe. 
10495 4 On time delivery, packaged very well. Excellent product that functions as advertised. Easy to place or remove, easy to use. 
10496 0 Camera stopped working within 30 days. It was a worst experience i had, i went for a trip with my family and thought to capture all the moments with this new camera but it stopped working all a sudden and i couldn t capture any pics of this trip. 
10497 2 It works pretty well, but the reels seem like they re a little to narrow for 35mm. The film was getting jammed a lot, and rounding the lead edges of the film with scissors seemed to help, but I ve hard to re-start rolls several times. 
10498 4 So far so good. .then again all batteries are good brand new.. 
10499 4 Good 
10500 1 JUNK 
10501 4 What I really like about this product is that there were two straps included with the mount that could be used. Hooray!! 
10502 1 sound wasn t great item looked and felt very cheap and batteries cost. 
10503 0 It did not accept the app, the disk would not load up.many trials and nothing. 
10504 4 Thanks 
10505 4 Quick and painless setup including wireless. Resolution is good. 2-way comm works. 
10506 0 bad camera sent 2 back to aweek will not try that brand again 
10507 4 I use it all the time, great lens. 
10508 4 Extremely thin and high quality. I would purchase again if I need another filter for my other lenses. 
10509 4 gave as birthday present. what a wonderful camera! 
10510 4 Perfect for all we use it for. Great for under water shark viewing. 
10511 4 Great price. Very easy to use. Also very sturdy. 
10512 4 Love everything about it 
10513 3 great tone, still tryung to find the right spot for it 
10514 3 Cameras arrived w/out any damage since it was packaged properly. Had problems setting 3 cameras wireless. DLink support was fantastic. Wait time was less than 5 mins. DLink support ( C6720565-AR004231, AR004207,AR004208) walked me thru the wireless setup. 
10515 4 Great price, excellent protection! 
10516 4 Solid construction and fits well in my arca ballhead. 
10517 2 Tripod itself is great, but the adapter isn t. I had to buy a replacement adaptor in a few weeks. 
10518 4 Hang on to it. It s small and you like having it on the camera. Check to be sure it s not loose. 
10519 3 I found this macro rail to be very well built, especially for the price point. movement is smooth and precise. I m quite happy with the purchase. 
10520 3 Good 
10521 4 Great little camera to mount on the bottom of a RC airplane! Tons of fun! Wonderfully clear pictures..This replaces the one I misplaced,it has a lot of potential to have fun with,especially on an electric plane, zero engine noise to attract attention. 
10522 1 the charger is okay but the batteries don t work but a few months. would not buy again 
10523 4 Great camera and SD card. Wasn t really buying it for anything else, but the tripod works pretty well too! Fantastic price point. 
10524 4 Gene Crawford 
10525 4 Good item 
10526 4 Wow from China. 
10527 4 Great product - works just like described -- 
10528 4 AMAZING AND THE SOUND DOES WORK!!! 
10529 4 like the colored borders 
10530 0 Old model camera. The case is too small for the camera with battery. Except for the camera, nothing is of the brand or description advertised. I paid $90 for expedite but I was not shipped for 2 days and by Snail mail. 
10531 2 Looks nice but it s not the most efficient. So if ur going for the looks, then go for it, but it s annoying when u want to take pictures 
10532 2 The camera seemed to work fine but it offered little adjustment possibilities, resulting in inconsistent and almost temperamental results. I supposed it might also have to do with the film available. 
10533 0 More than half of the joints broke, all at different times. Only used once. It s hard to try to turn or twist. Not worth it on my book. 
10534 0 Did not work!! 
10535 0 The sd card would not play on my Galaxy phone, the info on it said it would. 
10536 4 I love this follow focus ! Nice value for your money !!! It Is precise and works perfect after few mounts!!! Great product ! 
10537 4 Priced right works great.Was a bit concerned when I discovered that the rear hatch door on the expedition was all plastic rendering the magnet useless, but wait they included a Velcro sticky thing so all is well. Will update after our camping trip in the near future. 
10538 2 Worked as advertised for about a year or so....then the charge starts getting less and less. 
10539 4 good product 
10540 0 I have used this bag maybe five times and the zippers have failed. One zipper fell completely off and the other zipper popped out of the teeth; rendering the bag worthless. Look for another bag. 
10541 4 This camera delivered great pics on our vacation. The zoom capability is excellent for a moderately priced point-and-shoot model. Very happy with the purchase. 
10542 4 When I bought my GoPro, it only came with the waterproof housing. This housing actually lets the sound come through. 
10543 4 Works good 
10544 3 Good 
10545 4 Love my new camera and all of the goodies that came with it. It was shipped very quickly and everything was included as it was listed. Thanks for making my purchase easy and helping me capture many memories! 
10546 4 Perfect thank you 
10547 3 For the incredibly low price it is hard to complain but the product definitely feels like it costs- cheap. 
10548 4 This is just as good as the way more expensive clamps. It s versatile, strong construction, has a great grip. I trust it to hold my Zoom H6 if I want to boom it. So far hasn t budged an inch. 
10549 4 It s a cool-looking and resilient case 
10550 4 I just used one of the new my newly purchased batteries on a 7 day bear viewing trip. Although we didn t have non-stop photography, I was amazed that I didn t need to recharge the battery once during the week. I m VERY pleased with the product. 
10551 2 It s ok, you can t take a pic with it and it lets the phone tilt if you don t balance it perfectly. 
10552 3 A bit smaller than I would ve liked, but it s well made. Good for short photography trips! 
10553 4 Easily too use, give good colur. 
10554 2 one of the lights does not fit right. 
10555 4 Perfect for small fixed focal length lenses and teleconverters. I like that there are no plastic tabs or anything that rubs / chafes against other camera equipment. Very simple and very functional equipment protection. 
10556 4 Works great and you do have to iron the backdrops, no big deal. Want to learn how to close it, watch a youtube video they are out there and easy to find. 
10557 2 Not bad for the price! Feel like the lens could be clearer!! But all and all good deal!! 
10558 4 great item fast shipping thank you 
10559 3 Great for transferring your pictures to your phone and sharing on social media on the spot but just a heads up, if you shoot in raw the file sizes are large and can take a few minutes to transfer. 
10560 4 Met expectations. Great value for price. 
10561 0 Did not include the correct DVR. 
10562 3 it works, but not compatible with mine. 
10563 4 Nice frame, works beautifully, so simple to set up! 
10564 1 Too many issues with an off brand. Works great when it works but often finicky with the camera electronics. Sometimes just doesn t work 
10565 4 Great item. Great price for a very nice quality item. Thank you 
10566 3 Good value for money, good quality 
10567 3 So much fun to use for guests! 
10568 4 very good shipping, no problems A++ thanks Patrick 
10569 0 died after three months of use 
10570 4 Camera works great. The setup was very easy 
10571 4 Pretty good, looks durable! 
10572 4 The item arrived in reasonable time and was as described. There were Japanese import duties but I knew about them when I ordered. I wanted manuals etc for my camera to be in English rather than just Japanese. 
10573 4 Works great 
10574 4 Very good. 
10575 4 Exactly as advertised and the cheapest price around. It worked perfectly. 
10576 4 Works great!! 
10577 4 excellent 
10578 4 Best purchase of the year for me (400$). Awesome! 
10579 4 Better then the one that came with the camera 
10580 4 Amazing! Love it 
10581 1 Had purchased one a few months ago exact same one and the company would not take it back so we had to order this one ...It works great but we had to put the insides in it...it came with out the parts. 
10582 4 Very good product 
10583 4 Great 
10584 4 Good camera. Night vision is good 
10585 0 This tribrach has a iron items. I have been looked for tribrach with unmagnetic items and that it has items to brass or aluminium. Also screws are magnrtic item to iron. 
10586 4 Great monitor calibrator 
10587 4 Works as expected 
10588 4 Good quality. Clamp on stand difficult to open. Could use a sturdier stand but overall fine for my purpose. 
10589 3 The gentleman who received this as a gift is quite happy! 
10590 4 The product arrived before schedule without any damages. Very impressed. 
10591 4 Excellent tripod. Recording self-tapes has been so much easier with this. It has different levels and tons of different adjustments for any type of project you may do. 
10592 0 One of the lenses was messed up and not clear, and the clip had chips in it. Disappointed 
10593 4 I searched for the perfect strap. It is stylish, soft and durable. I love it. 
10594 3 Good replacement battery 
10595 4 Well made, no complaints here 
10596 4 Works great, sturdy with no problems. 
10597 4 Great value box. 
10598 4 thank you 
10599 4 Fit my camera perfect, and price was awesome. 
10600 4 No problems launching from grass now! 
10601 4 These work great for any screen. Gets it really clean. I normally use with my iPad & iPhone and have no complaints. Would repurchase. 
10602 4 works great on 1080 setting. what a cool camera. super easy to use. 
10603 4 Nice case. Fits in my pocket book. Has extra pockets for SD cards. 
10604 4 Wow! This is a great camera for my 10 year old daughter. She absolutely loves this camera and has the very best time capturing her own memories with it. 
10605 3 Nice little scanner for your old paper snapshots. The feed-through design and on-board storage make it easy to handle a large number of photos rapidly. It s a really good solution for those simply wanting to create a digital photo album. 
10606 0 Worked for about an hour, red light came on and that s it. Wouldn t reset, just a red &#34;I m dead&#34; light. 
10607 4 as expected nice case 
10608 4 A must have for extra batteries to keep at the ready. 
10609 4 The digital art was great. Nice and clear and good sorted in to easy to find and use groups. I have made several scrapbook pages for my self. 
10610 0 Do not buy this camera. It failed me after two weeks of use! The lens mechanism stopped working and no longer extends out. You are better off using your mobile phone camera! 
10611 4 god value 
10612 4 Best camera I ve ever had. I took pictures of the Pope in Rome and you would have thought I was standing next to him when I was way far away 
10613 4 I am very pleased with this lens...a good inbetween....got it before I needed it for wedding pictures....shipped as soon as she could.... 
10614 4 Cheap/inexpensive, but good. It s a small part so it doesn t have to be name brand. No one can notice that it isn t Canon. Fits and feels like stock. 
10615 4 Quality seems nice. Works as it should. Fits great. A great purchase! 
10616 1 THe zoom is not great, and I have had issues with pictures appearing pixculated. I am very aggravated with this camera. 
10617 1 Battery life doesn t seem to have alot of juice. The stock battery i received with my phantom 2 seems to last me longer! i dont think its what its advertised to be regarding longer battery life! 
10618 4 I recommend this product. I love it. Vary accessible. Not heavy. Light and easy to the hand. 
10619 3 Great battery and dual charger combination for the price. So far, the batteries have been decent on run times, and the dual charger makes charging much faster than the single unit that came with the camera. 
10620 2 Generally good product and easy to set up and configure. Main problem was that the unit I got was returned by another purchaser and the seller did not erase previous phone numbers from the memory, so alarms kept calling him! 
10621 4 wow! 
10622 4 pretty good price vs quality 
10623 4 WORKS GREAT. 
10624 4 Very good device for a beginner. Reasonably priced that will not hurt your budget. Lighting stand could be heavier or just use a sand bag. (Ankle weights could also work.) 
10625 0 It s Not sharp 
10626 3 I use this quite often, works well especially for the price.... 
10627 3 Camera is great but software that comes with it does not work. Took me several hours to get it to work 
10628 4 This is one of the best dash cams out there. This dash cam was easy to setup and get it running. Everything is working fine. I bought an extra one for my sister. 
10629 0 not at all what I thought it was. Returned 
10630 2 Received two different styles, one style was durable and easy to attach directions to for a wedding reception, the other one was like a cardboard box. Still waiting to see if pictures turned out. Fingers crossed! 
10631 4 It is working great for the long action shoots at the sporting events that I am coving 
10632 3 Cheap, but maybe deters the homeless. 
10633 4 This is the coolest tool a photographer could use. Great for long exposures and selfies 😁 
10634 4 Works perfectly. Good spare battery when you re doing lots of photos or video. 
10635 2 Device works fine, I just couldn t make the USB attachment work... 
10636 4 My grandaughter just loves this camera,she is six and can use this.thanks. 
10637 3 Works well. 
10638 4 Quick Delivery and came as stated!! 
10639 4 Good bunch of stuff for the gopro! Good quality 
10640 4 İt s worked well with Lumix FZ1000. 
10641 3 Nice bag Bought this for my new Canon DSL with extra lens. Has room for extra batteries, battery charger, manual. Includes shoulder strap and has good padding and divider to keep equipment from getting banged up. Good quality and great price. 
10642 4 Perfect fit for Sony Rx100 III. I have mine with screen protector + sony grip and it fits perfect. I also add 1 spare battery on the very bottom, the lid still closes but not 100%, more like 80%. 
10643 4 Works great. Very happy with it. I love the zoom function 
10644 2 hard to operate. 
10645 4 Great deal! I went to buy a second set and they were already out of stock. 
10646 4 Order arrived in time, works well with my Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS STM Lens, have not ran into issues. 
10647 4 Great buy! 
10648 3 nice camera but make sure to buy the micro SD card. no internal memory 
10649 4 Fast shipping works great for my cool pixels camera. 
10650 4 Reliable.... 
10651 4 fast shipping. works fine for my d7000 battery 
10652 4 amazing 
10653 2 Bought this for my small DSLR. It s much much smaller than I thought it would be. It s works fine for small cameras but if you have any type of DSLR, this absolutely will not work for you. 
10654 4 It fits and it s OEM. 
10655 4 I love this camera. It is easy to use the battery holds the charge for a long time. It fits in my pocket. I have purchased two cameras since but always go back to this one. 
10656 4 It s a battery. It works. 
10657 4 Just the right case for my newly purchased camera. Very handy and very compact... 
10658 0 Want to return but cannot and it does not work 
10659 0 Arrived broken. They insisted I watch their video on proper way to use. I ve been using these for 30 years. Broken is broken. Very, very low quality product. Not one you can count on. 
10660 4 Item arrived quickly and as described. So far so good is a great second battery! 
10661 3 Very well build, be aware that it does not hold the Gopro with the Wasabi extended battery. 
10662 1 Neither my wife or I found it comfortable and it made reaching the shutter release to cumbersome. We don t use it at all. 
10663 1 Not made well, very cheap looking. Got what I paid for. 
10664 3 Does the job. Comfortable yet slips from time to time. 
10665 0 the tow arms too short, the V-grove is too narrow, there is no way you can hang monitor and light and mike at the same time! 
10666 4 Brand new and fast shipping. 
10667 4 Received right one time like promised 
10668 4 Excellent choice. 
10669 4 It was a great purchase can t fault it superb really pleased 
10670 4 Really enjoying my first prime lens. Great value. A little disappointed that it arrived a day late. Thankfully, I wasn t leaving for my trip until the following day! 
10671 4 Great 
10672 4 Great 
10673 4 Really easy to use when you get water temp right great product 
10674 3 Gets the job done just fine. Anyone knows if i can use this adaptor with RZ67 lens? Or the RZ67 adaptor with RB67 lens? 
10675 4 great product keeps my go pro safe and secure with a great peace of mind .very pleased Thanks!! 
10676 3 good price and product. 
10677 4 It is awesome!!! 
10678 3 Nice collection of accessories but low quality of course! 
10679 4 Perfect, great quality at a rock bottom price! The customer service was Awesome too. 
10680 4 yes. Exact color of the photo. Nice quality as usual. 
10681 3 An excellent pouch to hold filters. Instead of 4 plastic filter holders you can condense them into one convenient holder. 
10682 4 Great 
10683 4 Deeper than what I needed, but this is a very good product. 
10684 4 Fits Sony RX-100 ii perfectly. 
10685 4 Works just like the orignal 
10686 4 Keeps my Nikon Coolpix floating and handy. It s great for the pool and getting those family shots. 
10687 4 This is a great little product for the price. Certainly worth the price. 
10688 2 smaller than I thought and it doesn t hold a lot. I have put the camera in a bigger bag and use this a protective case. 
10689 2 It s a great camera for the price hands down. Only down side is that it ll record only 10-12 min videos.... 
10690 4 Great cleaning tool for under $10 
10691 0 Poor! It doesn t value the money that I have paid. The head of tripod doesn t screw the Gopro. 
10692 4 Super Clear! 
10693 4 Fine product. Works as intended 
10694 0 These cameras are very buggy as they stop working all the time and have to unplug them the ptz doesn t as promised 
10695 4 It covers the flash connection. Enough said. 
10696 4 excellent. 
10697 4 Needed a lens cap with the leash so won t lose it and so far no lose! 
10698 4 Have had this bag for about a week, really like it. I have my Nikon D4 with my 80-400mm, 70-200mm, 27-70mm and my 14-24mm in this bag and it fits perfect. 
10699 0 For a GoPro with accessories this case is not near big enough. 
10700 4 This was a gift and My friend fell in love with the camera. 
10701 0 I threw it away :-( 
10702 4 Works seamlessly between my D610 and my iPhone 6+. Refurbished saved me money and shipping was fast and free! 
10703 4 Pretty good set for a good price. This set covers it all for beginners 
10704 2 It does what it say, and it awesome that its directional. The Gopro mount can actually pop out of the housing pretty easily. My buddy wiped out wake boarding and the gopro popped off. If you re going to use this for water sports MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A FLOAT! 
10705 4 Great battery for D750. Factory replacement. 
10706 4 love it small and compact ,just the right size for me and keeps my go pro safe. Thanks!! 
10707 4 Works as expected but needs a ball mount. Ordered ball mount today. 
10708 4 The price is certainly right! Just don t forget to turn them off when you re done. 
10709 4 Flimsy, but it gets the job done. 
10710 4 Awesome 
10711 4 works as needed 
10712 4 very good! 
10713 0 The charger was the wrong one for the batteries, so I didn t have a camera for my trip BOO 
10714 3 They re fine with me, no worries. 
10715 4 Received fast, great product!! Got this camera for my garage because I once received a notification that the garage door was open with no way to verify with absolute certainty. This camera works flawlessly and was very easy to setup and get running. It s wireless. Love it!! 
10716 4 Easy setup. 
10717 4 Works great! I am happy to have gotten this as I lost my charger! 
10718 4 Everything came just as expected. 
10719 3 Met my standards. Fast shipping 
10720 3 I have not used this product under water yet. I did take a couple of pictures with it and they were great. I purchased this camera for a trip to the Bahamas in January. I hope it takes great pictures and I hope it doesn t leak! 
10721 4 Love how this is built & would buy a 2nd one if I need it. 
10722 4 Nice leather strap. I wish it was 4&#34; longer, I m a big guy. works OK though. comes with everything you need to attach and protect the camera finish 
10723 1 The base is ok, but the little ball head is really flimsy/junky. I m using it to hold a small LED lite array, so I just superglued the ball in-place and am using the LED device s mount for movement. 
10724 4 lost the first charger a good replacement for sure. 
10725 4 Great battery ato a great price 
10726 4 Love at first sight. This is an amazing case and I knew I had to get this. 
10727 4 I got this for my Coolpix 500 camera and it works great! Also, delivery was very quick. I will order thru this site in the future. Thank You 
10728 4 very good but too expensive. $129..9 was a perfect price for it. 
10729 4 Great Product/Great Value. 
10730 4 very good quality, big upgrade in terms of design from the previous. 
10731 4 Excellent 
10732 0 Did not work for me, I am using a channel master +,dvr for tell me how to connect it. Help 
10733 4 Reasonable and so needed for this camera! 
10734 4 This is a great bargain for the money. Half of these things exceed the price alone and the quality is just as good. 
10735 4 Fast delivery, excellent brand 
10736 4 Works good smooth rotation, no distortion except at max 
10737 3 Easy and fun to use 
10738 4 Easy installation, works right away. I can now view remotely from my phone or desktop. 
10739 1 I think it s such a rip off that this item isn t included in the Vello light bouncer. It works well but, doesn t warrant the price. It should be included in the light bouncer. 
10740 4 Extremely good, my camera has been dropped, and it hasn t broken. 
10741 4 I thought this selfie stick was remotely control but they are not. 
10742 4 impressed! This was easily able to support my micro 4/3 panasonic gx 7 with the 9-18mm 4-5.6. Upright position only though! 
10743 4 Wonderful 
10744 4 This quick release clamp is used on my Jobu junior gimbal head. I just remove the gimbal arm and install the clamp to give me a side mounted head 
10745 3 works very well 
10746 4 excellent image quality 
10747 2 The threads of the screw that attach the plate to the camera all mess up. Thus, unable to use. Other than that, it s ok. 
10748 4 Great camera !! 
10749 0 Very bad item, used it one time and broke. 
10750 4 Can never have too much extra film on hand 
10751 4 Very nice product. If it weighed a little more, it would be an excellent product. But I m using it for a Note 4 phone, which is heavier than the GoPro. I Recommend it for it s intended purpose. 
10752 4 works great 
10753 4 Up to now, battery works correctly. 
10754 4 This full package was well thought and has all the items needed for a good photo service. The product was delivered on time with all the items as described on Amazon site 
10755 4 Great case and great price 
10756 4 Excellent and they came earlier than expected. Thank you. 
10757 4 Thank You! 
10758 2 Everything appears to be good quality products however some documentation would be nice. There was nothing at all and since there are a lot of individual parts I m really not sure what everything is for and how it fits together. 
10759 4 batteries worked fine, arrived promptly, and the charger, not available from the store where I bought the camera, is a nice bonus 
10760 0 It did not work for what it was supposed to work for, which was the sanza Clip 
10761 2 Good product but not the best quality, the head strap was loose which I cant fix my camera on. 
10762 0 Horrible does not work I would like my money back please ! 
10763 4 have it on my fishing rod. love it 
10764 4 Fantastic lens 
10765 0 Nothing but problems from this thing. From freezing to not coming on at all. Doesn t even record you whole drive. Only records when it feels &#34;vibrations&#34;... Well the sensor must be poopoo! Do yourself a favor and stay away 
10766 4 best camera !!! 
10767 4 Really nice package of converter rings. Decent quality for the money. Would buy again... 
10768 3 Works great, no problems 
10769 4 BETTER then expected excellent photos and long length movies taken with great clarity. ONLY option we would like to see id a snap on red lens filter, this would bring out the best of this product. 
10770 3 Solid lens for the price, hunts a little and motor noise can be heard during video sequences but and all around keeper 
10771 1 To easy to OPEN, slight knock and it flips up 
10772 2 It wasn t strong enough for my use. 
10773 0 The product didn t even reach me. 
10774 4 Works the same as the original charger, but I like this one more as it comes with a car DC plug to charge while on the road! 
10775 4 Bought for my brother and he loves it and uses it when he skateboards and bikes at skateparks. 
10776 4 By far my favorite and definitely most versatile gopro mount Can literally mount this to anything! 
10777 4 nice soft ring just what I wanted 
10778 4 I used this with a one channel dvr in the car, and it works great 
10779 4 This backpack is amazing! I love it. I switched from a Canon over the shoulder case to this, and I am absolutely thrilled with the decision. It was long overdue. 
10780 4 Products are awesome, great quality, fast Shipping, unfortunately I had 2 missing lens at the time that the box arrived but other than that. Great Products. 
10781 3 Performs as the original Nikon QR foot does. Quick to put and take off. I like the rubber coated tightening knobbed compared to Nikon s. Great value compared to Nikon OEM, 4X less cost! Only time will reveal whether it is as robust as the Nikon. 
10782 4 Great camera system easy to install 
10783 4 Love it. 
10784 4 A very cost effective alternative to the official GoPro version 
10785 3 very sturdy, easy to install. Little pricey on the import duties. 
10786 0 The battery lasted 6 weeks in a device designed to run for 5 years before replacing the battery. A bad product! 
10787 4 I can t believe all of the good quality gear you get for such a low price. Everything works great and makes the Gopro so much more versatile. Definitely a great buy. 
10788 3 For the price this is a good tripod. It may need to be oiled if you want to turn it easily for panning shots. 
10789 3 Bought this to add two more cameras to security system. Works good 
10790 4 great product works great 
10791 4 Very good 
10792 4 Great clip! 
10793 1 No battery cover useless as is 
10794 4 The battery works beautifully. No complaints. 
10795 1 I received a completely different camera than what is shown in the pictures 
10796 0 This item clearly shows a 2nd part in the bike handle bar mount position photo. The description and images are misleading. 
10797 4 Perfect lens. 
10798 0 The first day we used this product on set, 2 of three screws holding &#34;Sticks&#34; together came loose and we had to use gaffers tape to hold it together. I went to hardware store and replaced screws and it still falls apart. Do Not waste your time with this product! 
10799 4 Worked as expected! Only draw back: No instructions for cage assembly! 
10800 4 I like it and would buy it again. 
10801 4 Great base for my Benro Transfunctional tripod. Now I can convert my tripod s removable leg into a monopod. 
10802 4 an accessory for every type of activity 
10803 4 Good, inexpensive after-market replacement. 
10804 4 Great Product, Just as Described!!! 
10805 4 Item arrived as described. Quick ship. Highly recommend!! 
10806 4 Love love love! Set up is easy. No cables. Totally wireless 
10807 4 Great action camera for a cheaper price. Thumbs up.👍 
10808 1 I was hoping to be able to have some sort of focus option and be able to zoom. There aren t many times this camera will be very useful. 
10809 4 Works fine. 
10810 4 Outstanding underwater camera holder. I used it while diving and it was everything that the manufacturer claims it to be. Worked like a charm. 
10811 4 Typical excellent Canon quality. This has been a great addition to my collection. 
10812 4 I&#34;ll recommend to anyone buy this product 
10813 4 Great Items.. My customers are really happy... 
10814 4 We love it, but would be nice if it could move around the room by using an option. but it is great 
10815 2 Love it. thanks red giant. 
10816 4 Great case, flexible inside pocket is adjustable, heavily padded yet lightweight. 
10817 4 Very good and chsrges fast 
10818 3 It works 
10819 4 They arrived fast and work perfect!! 
10820 4 Works great. 
10821 4 Love them great clairity for a resanable price 
10822 4 Best one 
10823 4 This is a great monitor with a clear picture and very good quality. If you have a high end security system then you need a good clear monitor to go with it. Old monitors can change the quality of your picture coming from the security cameras through your DVR. 
10824 3 The package was a gift, so it s not fair that I rate it. I can say that everything that was included in the offer arrived on time and was in brand new condition. The person receiving the gift was very excited and continues to enjoy using it. 
10825 0 Very cheaply made, not intuitive at all. But the real reason for the one star is that after two months it stop working, now all the pictures look almost white, impossible to distinguish anything. 
10826 3 Awesome inexpensive light ring, the only con is that you can t use full range of your wide angle or wide angle zoom lens because the ring will crop the borders of the image. 
10827 4 i love this camera. it is replaces an older model from 10 years ago. easy to handle. takes great pictures. the accessories are an extra bonus which avoid having to purchase them separately. canon products are very durable. 
10828 1 Wasn t quite what I thought I ordered 
10829 4 Outstanding Item and fast shipping. 
10830 3 It s a good camera when it works, but sometimes we have had to call for tech support. However, they have been very helpful. 
10831 3 decent arch support for my feet. I wear them all the time. Like the style and looks, have held up well so far. 
10832 1 Thing works like it s designed but the lens cover (rounded piece) doesn t fit the lens hood so it s really stupid. I had another issue where the ring got stuck to my lens and had to get some tools to take it off. 
10833 4 It s cute and very convenient. 
10834 4 Thanks, it s perfect, very reasonable price too. 
10835 2 It is ok, although I had big troubles using AAA batteries it is really annoying because they don´t fit perfectly. 
10836 0 Had to return as it would pair with my Blackberry Z10 but seemed to interrupt other functions on my phone and too hard to figure out for me - didn t have time to waste to figure it out. Time to change to another phone probably... 
10837 4 I love everything about this camera, I upgraded from a T3i. Great kit lens very pleased. 
10838 3 Great Product 
10839 4 Absolutely great buy!!! Love having my charging dock and the extra batteries so I can just switch them out quickly! Batteries work just as good as the ones that came with the camera 
10840 3 I love this film sheets! They are the perfect size to keep on my wallet. I ordered the 20 film sheets and they arrived in 2 days!!!!! I was really surprised! Im definitely going to buy more!! 
10841 4 tried off brand before - it didn t work. Only the Fuji brand seems to work as replacement 
10842 4 Was not disappointed. 
10843 4 BOUGHT IT FOR GRANDDAUGHTERS BIRTHDAY, SHE ABSOLYELY LOVES IT! HER PICTURES ARE AWESOME. 
10844 3 Solid case for new Phantom. Backpack is deep enough to fit everything securely. Enough cutouts and pockets to fit all my gear. 
10845 4 Price on these are great. I ll update later if they don t last as long as expected. 
10846 4 Works like a charm. 
10847 2 Not made to accept the qd 1.5 loops......the sling is a closed unit.........you can not add them on 
10848 0 Product does not work. I sent it back. 
10849 4 OK 
10850 4 great little camera! 
10851 1 The camera looks *generally* as advertised. However, the &#34;30 LEDs&#34; is false advertisement. Inserting batteries causes a single red LED to light up, and even then it only blinks. In no way does it look like faux IR. I would not purchase this again. 
10852 4 easy to add working great 
10853 4 It s a great kit for your gopro heros 
10854 2 Everything fits and works as it should :) A bunch of extra unnecessary things are included in order to increase the appeal but It beats paying for the original GoPro pieces and they work just as well! 
10855 3 It does the job of a lens protector without sacrificing image quality at a great price. 
10856 4 these work great - will be buying additional items for other cameras and similar items with straps 
10857 3 Good Camera... Great Picture... Easy Operation From both PC and Android (Apple ????? not my way).. Note: camera ID is in Low Case... NOT Upper Case as shown in the instruction. 
10858 4 This kit was exacty what I needed and I am very pleased with my purchase. I would recommend this company and this product. 
10859 3 It lasts for hours, which is great since the batteries that I had did not last much. 
10860 4 Excellent product, it is rescue my waterproof camera is alive again. 
10861 4 Fast shipping and quality product. 
10862 4 If you are an actor in this day and age you are likely taping your own auditions. This is the best deal on the internet. You don t have to be a lighting or grip guy to figure this stuff out. Get this product asap. 
10863 3 Good as expected 
10864 4 Bought it from PoEDepot and got an American UL listed version. Will buy again! 
10865 4 amazing 
10866 4 Great filter, using it on my 50mm and 24mm Canon lenses to take some excellent long exposure photography. 
10867 3 I haven t used my camcorder in years because the battery wouldn t hold a charge. At a discounted price I can now capture the first s of my toddler. 
10868 4 I have installed it in a tennis complex. Absolutely worth every penny. For the price you cannot get better. The quality of the images are top notch plus i got a 500gb Hard disk with it. 
10869 4 Very helpful 
10870 4 Yup it pops on the front of my lens and does whatever a tulip lens hood is supposed to do. I dunno all the pros have them so I figured I should too. Gives me some street cred and that it worth every penny. 
10871 4 Not much more to say, functioned exactly as described. Build quality seems solid and has no trouble rotating the weight of my Canon SL1 
10872 3 Easy to install and the quality of the video is decent. Although the apps do crash frequently. 
10873 4 My son told me this one was the best one to get. I take a lot of pictures for my online store and it works great. I been using it daily. 
10874 3 Arrived on time and as shown, used only to do a few splash shots. 
10875 4 Great for the price. Definitely worth having in my bag to trigger a small flash. I found that it caught the light pretty easily within a relatively close distance. 
10876 4 The first time I use camera, I try to install, I personally think it s very good 
10877 2 It looks fake. I did find these at Best Buy cheaper. 
10878 4 A++ 
10879 4 Just used it for ziplining 
10880 4 The kits gives you everything you need to keep your camera clean. 
10881 4 I have used everything that came in this pack. I wouldn t encourage the selfie stick as there are much better options (like the GoPole). However, this whole package is incredibly useful and anything in this is worth the cost. 
10882 4 Great Thank you 
10883 4 Good deal and quality ,love will order more 
10884 4 Fits well, does what it s supposed to do 
10885 3 Pic nice and clear and easy to use-straight out the box with two cords done. I just wish it didn t lean no way to adjust 
10886 3 Item delivered on time, was as described 
10887 4 It s handy having an extra battery around! It keeps its charge very well. 
10888 4 Great buy! 
10889 4 Good 
10890 4 Very comfortable to use and keep my hands free. Hand are not getting tired on caring gear and shoulder doesn t hurt. 
10891 4 compact and great 
10892 1 This does not fit the go pro 3 housing. The black frame alining is different from this LED housing. Simply put it doesn t fit 
10893 4 Quality stuff right here !! Well worth the asking price for everything you get !!! I loved mine !! 
10894 4 Albert Ferman was the tech who helped us set up the camera. He was very helpful and explained all my questions clearly and showed us all the functions.. Very patient and courteous on phone as well. Happy with the product. 
10895 4 Perfect combo for a small price. 
10896 0 Spend the extra money and get the brackets that are made out of metal, these are plastic and I had a brand new strobe hit the floor because of them. They just don t tighten down enough on the flash shoe to keep it from moving and sliding. 
10897 0 the batteries do not hold a charge 
10898 1 Charged once I received them went to used them a month later they did not hold a charge 
10899 4 Very good quality. Works just as expected and has a large amount of adjustment 
10900 4 Fit perfectly! Thanks!! 
10901 4 Great 
10902 4 Minimal distortion, this thing has become my favorite lens for walk around, and landscapes. Totally worth every penny. 
10903 4 Henry was a great tech. Got me up and running in no time. Works great. 
10904 4 I got this for my girlfriends camera and she loves it. She lost her lens cap, so she uses this to keep the dust off on a constant basis. Its been about two months and the cleaner hasn t broken down and the brush hasn t lost any bristles. 
10905 4 Bought this lens kit for my daughter and she loves it! 
10906 4 Wonderful product. 
10907 2 Good product for the money. Display software needs work. You cannott zoom or clip areas for motion detection. You cannot delere individual pictures. You must reformat the whole memory stick. Good quality video,say or night. 
10908 4 GoPro adaptor for aux mic. I have a ton of these. All good. 
10909 4 I use it for carrying tripods and lights for filming. 
10910 3 Seem to work fine. 
10911 4 Don t buy the dome port without this. In fact, KNEKT should not sell them separately - makes no sense. The cover fits perfectly and is 100% essential. 
10912 4 saved my bacon on a recent install 
10913 3 Great case..like it a lot holds everything well..if you use the blade guards it is a very tight fit to get the arms in with the attachment at the end of the arms..over all it s a good back pack case.. 
10914 4 No problems so far....good value. 
10915 4 great. 
10916 4 Looks awesome and feels great especially when I put the larger lenses on. 
10917 3 Great buy. Fits my sony video camera perfectly 
10918 4 I was reluctant at first because of the price, you get what you pay for. But it is better than expected. 
10919 0 Canopy sent me a download that was illegible. I requested one in print someone could read. As of this date they have refused to send a legible copy, so I am cancelling the plan. 
10920 3 It s a little heavy and I have a difficult time using to take clear pictures of my moving kids. but overall it is a great telephoto. the rest of the package is just a bonus. 
10921 4 Great mount for the Xiaomi! 
10922 4 fast shipping and i love this camera so far the battery life lasts pretty long and i love all the features it has :) 
10923 4 Very easy to set up, very good for the price 
10924 4 Great Lens for the price - no noise in the corners - for an inexpensive wide angle it s impressive... 
10925 4 Product works great! I broke the one that came with my camera, and this was a good match! Great price and it turned my frown upside down. 
10926 4 For the price and what this does! Get 1 of these and they transmit to each other Talks to other receivers also, Get it. Brands don t matter when it comes to flashes. 
10927 3 great product 
10928 4 Very good bundle 
10929 4 Fast delivery very happy 
10930 2 Camera is well built and takes excellent photos and videos. Not user friendly to transfer photos. Pain in the neck for this part. 
10931 1 There were no instructions included and we never could get it to focus correctly. Maybe it s just our incompetence, but it is sitting on a shelf. Thank you for your interest. 
10932 4 Good new for Sony a3000 with high speed sync 1/4000s on camera shoe with neewer NW-985C E-TTL. It just flash...no zoom or communication with camera..it can not shoot high speed sync on sony a7r. Why? Funy for Sony with build the same universal hot shoe. 
10933 4 Camera is compact and great for filming. 
10934 4 way better performance with low light resolution or zoom focus than similar NKon - good to have a grip too 
10935 4 Worked perfect for our white water rafting trip! 
10936 3 Bought it to fit 2 - 21.5&#34; iMacs. They fit great! I tried to fit a third and it barely didn t fit. Great case though! 
10937 4 For the price you get more than I expected. I thought it would be cheap quality but it works well, video quality is very good and have not had any problems at all As advertised ! 
10938 3 Good capacity. 
10939 4 Works great. Using it on two different Sony A65 lenses. 
10940 4 Great price and lots of great GoPro gear! 
10941 4 perfect fit 
10942 4 very good 👍 
10943 3 Item was as described and the actual product was in new condition. But the actual package it was is had been opened. You could clearly see the original tapping had been teared on all sides. Luckily the product works fine. 
10944 4 Very sturdy case. 
10945 4 Good quality cable and the extra adapters a great plus 
10946 4 Love the extended tightening screw. Works great. 
10947 4 This was a good purchase. 
10948 4 Good performance; good price point 
10949 4 Great little camera. 
10950 3 Just as described-very nice. 
10951 3 Great product, just v wish it had mini USB instead of micro USB. Other than that it s a winner. 
10952 4 Exactly what I needed 
10953 4 Works wonderful 
10954 2 Canon has a 1 year warranty that they have honored for me numerous times. I buy Nikon now. Either way, you don t really need this. 
10955 2 nice cheap alternative to big dollar GOPRO mount does what it is supposed to do 
10956 4 The product is of good quality and works as described. 
10957 4 works well 
10958 2 Worked as expected 
10959 3 Very good overall, just the battery life is poor.should use AA battery 
10960 0 They are a piece of s*** they re no good I m sorry to say that 
10961 4 Super mirrorless camera. 
10962 4 Great kit, very nice quality. 
10963 4 Have not used the ballhead extensively so far, but everything seems fine so far. Appears sturdy and supports my camera very well. 
10964 4 Great camera for the money, no complaints so far 
10965 4 Very cool camera. I ve had a lot of fun playing around with it. It takes great video and the sound works well even with the case on. Here is a neat trout video: &#60;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/i2oxFU3u1uU&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&#62;&#60;/iframe&#62; 
10966 4 Perfect entry level SLR 
10967 1 Took about three weeks to get it... They re pretty thin packs. 
10968 3 This product works as expected and is well built. 
10969 1 The one I purchased from an another store but it was a GoPro Suction Cup Mount non the less. The camera would shack and not allow for smooth filming. 
10970 0 Absolute Junk. Could not get this camera to be recognized by the dlink software. Followed all instructions, tried both WPS and wired methods, tried both a desktop and a laptop. 
10971 4 Can t even tell it s a refurb! Auto focus works on my d3000 & 5100! I have no complaint! I am happy with the price and the product! I plan to order this for my assistant to use. 
10972 2 Very good quality. Was impressed until i saw a big dot on my recorded videos. It is stuck inside the lense and not outside the lense. We ll see when i get my replacement item. 
10973 0 A real piece of junk, a waste of good money. Used it twice and the small metal connectors at the bottom that make contact with the battery broke, it s real garbage! 
10974 4 Can t find anything to complain about. Brush hairs are soft and does not fall out. Brush retracts into unit to make it compact and cover prevents hair from getting dirty. What else can one ask for? 
10975 2 It s worth what I paid for it. 
10976 4 Thank You 
10977 4 Nice! 
10978 0 Mine came broken I can t even use it because the metal part of the strap is broken 
10979 3 works like a battery should work 
10980 4 I give this to all my clients. 
10981 4 This is a great product!! I paid for mine $85.00 with free shipping, received it within 1 week of order. Picture quality is great, and really simple installation. I love the 2 in 1 screen. With this product in an accident or driving complaint, I am covered. Highly recommended!! 
10982 1 This was an excellent camera until it sat for a while. Now it will not charge from the battery. I called a shop and they said they can t get parts from Kodak and not to buy any more Kodaks. $500 camera down the drain! 
10983 4 Very good product 
10984 4 Great 
10985 3 Works great, fits around my NX3000 (without the detachable flash). Should be enough to protect my camera while traveling around Europe. 
10986 4 Batteries and charger both worked great. Batteries worked good in my Nikon Coolpix S3700. 
10987 4 Very Nice 
10988 4 I love this little guy. I use a ton of tripods and this little guy fits anywhere. Great price and awesome features with the remote. I totally recommend. I received this for review at no cost. Opinion is 100% mine. 
10989 4 What a great case! Very sturdy and holds everything you need to have a great day at the beach or anywhere else. 
10990 4 Nice 
10991 4 Great experience & great shipping 
10992 4 This float works wonderfully. 
10993 4 I like for those time when needed and for my go pro session convenient and yet secure. Thanks!! 
10994 4 This is so wonderful for long distance families, its great for grandparents. 
10995 4 Great batteries! Excellent value! Will buy again! 
10996 4 Works as needed! Good product 
10997 4 Perfect case for the GoPro! I use it for my GoPro Hero+ LCD, and it fits the camera plus all of the necessary accessories perfectly. It s sturdy and also small enough to fit inside my backpack. Overall, great case! 
10998 4 does just what its supposed to do 
10999 3 Great Product 
11000 4 Works like the original. 
11001 3 First one I ordered was D.O.A. but the company has a good return policy. I got a full refund. Decided to give it another try. New camera pen works great! 
11002 3 good product 
11003 4 Works well on my diatone 250 quad. Bigger board than the other FPV cameras I ve had so I didn t even need to zip tie it. It just fits perfectly! 
11004 4 It works perfect and i m on horseback with a lot of movement. 
11005 1 Small bag. Not enough to accessories. 
11006 4 Fits my canon! 
11007 4 I have never taken better portraits. It seems to make skin look smooth and perfect. Although, a baby s skin is pretty much perfect. Great little camera. 
11008 4 Excellent , dose everything it advertises I bought it help with a special needs child. 
11009 4 Thank you 
11010 4 Excellent one 
11011 3 Bought as a gift for my father. It uses motion detectors to turn itself on, which is very creepy and disturbing at night. But the display is beautiful. 
11012 4 Love it ... using it for my elderly mother in a mother in law suite! 
11013 4 Just what was needed for the project; wide angle and fast lens. 
11014 3 Gift for dad. He loved it Very portable and good viewing. The tripod is a bit flimsy but I guess Ok for the price, hence 4 stars 
11015 0 Broke at application. 
11016 2 I think bean bag filler works best with a mixture of these beads for light weight and heavier material like sunflower seeds. 
11017 4 Why buy just the lens when you receive so much more for the same price? 
11018 3 It was good but not what I want it but it s really good came a week early 
11019 4 great for travel; used on a safari and it was no burden to carry along 
11020 0 this didn t work for me or my Nikon d5300. Of course I didn t try it right away so, I am beyond the 30 day return period. Charger indicates a full charge but when I put it in the camera, it is not charged. 
11021 4 Great reponse time, arrived in New Zealand 
11022 4 It has a pretty long life and it flies easily! 
11023 1 Very difficult to get to work right. 
11024 4 Great for underwater Video. With the monopod the fish are not afraid of the camera. You can get great shots. Love the way the pod extends. Flip up the lever and extend the pod. 
11025 4 Awesome and great for filming!!!! 
11026 4 Exactly What I Wanted. It s GREAT ! 
11027 2 Thought it was rubber material. It s actually plastic. I m assuming it ll still float okay. 
11028 4 But keep misplacing damn things. 
11029 1 works great at first and then it started making this weird beep sound now it doesnt work 
11030 3 Great Camera case. 
11031 4 light and easy to pack. good 
11032 3 Nice wireless camera. Setup was easy and the smartphone app is pretty good 
11033 4 Magnificent! 
11034 4 Very satisfied with purchase, 
11035 4 VERY GOOD LAST LONGER. I RECOMENDED 
11036 4 Nice kit. 
11037 0 You need to hunt down required accesories and build this one yourself to get it to work - of you can find the right parts outside of London 
11038 4 I thought it would take 2 of them to float my Nikon AW130 but 1 does the job with capacity to spare! 
11039 3 Not Canon Brand, but it does the job nicely. 
11040 4 Loved it and arrived on time. Easy to use and upload photos. 
11041 4 Great product. Like, it s a good buy. I would buy it again. 
11042 2 AC adapter died a few weeks after the warranty expired but besides that; its a great camera. 
11043 3 Good camera for the money. The box is sturdy (industrial) and the design is simple. My only complaint is the shipping time... almost 3 weeks seems a little long. 
11044 3 This is decent for the price however, it burns through batteries like crazy! 
11045 4 Holds everything for my Hero 3+ perfectly. No longer need to go hunting around for anything. 
11046 4 They work great 
11047 4 Buy the right size bag, put my equipment is very good, prices are affordable. 
11048 4 Great charger, charges better than the Sony charger. 
11049 4 this had everything I needed for dslr cleaning - works great - would recommend 
11050 4 Works like a charm, and that is all that matters. You cant complain about the price either. 
11051 4 Does the job and can t beat the price. 
11052 4 Perfect love them 
11053 4 Just as described--and just what I needed--with perfect shipping! Thanks so much! 
11054 4 We use this backdrop to take pictures of the dogs and cats at the animal shelter that I volunteer for. It is a volunteer favorite. We do put a white bead board on the ground for the floor instead of the wood. 
11055 3 I still dont get what it does, it does not fit in my GoPro Hero 4 Silver, but its a cool keychain and bottle opener 
11056 4 small_ 
11057 4 [[ASIN:B00JAJ9U8K Vimtag (Fujikam) 361 HD, IP/Network ,Wireless, Video Monitoring, Surveillance, security camera,plug/play, Pan/Tilt with Two-Way Audio and Night Vision]] Honestly…….. one of the easiest items I have ever setup. Very clear step by step directions in package. Pretty much plug and play. Love it! 
11058 3 Great bag. Can cary everything that I want with room to spare. 
11059 4 works great innovative design 
11060 4 crash pack is essential 
11061 1 Cheap plastic, never worked as intended. Can hold two batteries but only pulls from one at a time. 
11062 2 LVR is fine for my hero 4, but cannot charge while your recording with case, I prefer the non lcd vesion 
11063 4 Vincent was awesome technical support! Highly recommend this product over the more costly options (home security systems, etc.)! 
11064 0 IT took OK pictures then died after 2 days. The camera would power up but crash when taking a photo. 
11065 0 I was so excited when I got this cables. After 2 week of used the connection that screws into the camera broke. I am very disappointed.. please do yourself a favor and don t spend your hard working money on this crappy cables. 
11066 1 I received the camera and the only way to charge it is thru the camera. Also 1 battery was bad out of the 3 
11067 4 I have used this product for over twenty years and are perfect for security lighting systems that can be controlled from anywhere in the house, with an X-10 control unit. 
11068 3 A great camera. Feels like a real camera in the hands. The only reason why I didn t give it five stars is because of the problem endemic to all digitals, the lag time on the shutter. 
11069 4 This is an excellent kit for the price. I bought it mainly for two spare batteries. Batteries always seem to &#34;go dead&#34; when you least expect it. Can t beat this deal. 
11070 0 This cameras are just poorly made. Either they reset, send me an email every minute or I cannot connect to them. Nothing but headaches. Thank god I only bought two. Don t waste your money on these. 
11071 4 Fast delivery as usual and it is just what I wanted for my New Nikon, Thank you very much & I will be sure to use you in the future. 
11072 4 It is a great product for cleaning glasses. 
11073 4 Great travel tripod could not believe how small it folds up to.Very strong for being so light. Highly recommended 
11074 3 this is a gift, looks like it will work perfectly - it would be nice to have an instruction booklet 
11075 0 They send me defect one...I will never buy this again 
11076 1 Was very easy to set up (especially for a new photographer) but the box was missing one of the backdrops and only had one umbrella and NO RETURNS by the time I got back in town to realize it was missing pieces from the package. 
11077 4 excellent product. 
11078 2 No comments 
11079 4 Good watch for the value! Would buy again! 
11080 4 Replacement batteries for my camera, work great, thanks. 
11081 4 The sound quality blows my mind 
11082 4 Works very well & the price is great as well 
11083 4 Good 
11084 3 Great. Hate the viewfinder. 
11085 0 First time using this flash on my Nikon D3200 the flash was stuck on the hot shoe. Small ball bearing on bottom of flash would not retract all the way so it would not release the flash. Had to bring it in to have it removed. Poor quality. 
11086 4 This product is exactly what I needed. I ve been shoot for over half a century and finally decided that I was going to have some fun creating my scenes. This product was shipped immediately and appears to be a great quality for the price. 
11087 2 Yes they work, but the adhesive is horrible and does not stick. Ended up having to use 3M double sided tape to attach one mount to my daughters helmet. 
11088 4 Product is well built and study. Light weight and very versatile, and the carry bag is perfect. 
11089 4 exactly as described.. 
11090 3 Works well, doubles as an iphone and a GoPro stick. 
11091 4 Love this one! 
11092 4 This item was perfect for my iPhone 
11093 4 Great batteries at a fraction of the cost of originals....Work great and hold a charge! 
11094 4 very good and fast service would order again 
11095 3 Works well, and glad to have a protective filter on my Panasonic DMC-LX7. But, really, Panasonic should have just made the lens barrel filter ready, rather than compelling one to buy another item... 
11096 1 A neat item but was defective screws were never installed properly. 
11097 4 Good & it is my need. Thanks! 
11098 4 I am about to buy a few more of these... Just what I needed for my Sigma 50-500 OS. The QR plate that came with my Airhed ballhead was just not cutting it. For under $10, this thing is solid! 
11099 2 This camera is okay for a basic camera and for the price. Day shots are good, night not so good. Poor quality build. It s good for travel. 
11100 4 Darkhorse accommodated by request for special shipping so I could get these albums by my wedding day. We used them as our guest book and they were great! Darkhorse communicated quickly by email and helped me get what I needed, on time, for no additional cost. 
11101 4 Works great. Exactly what I expected 
11102 3 It works well with practically any camera or tripod, and picks up sound quite nicely. 
11103 3 Arrived quickly and works exactly as intended. 
11104 4 Excellent product! I use this diffuser almost exclusively with my canon flash. It provides excellent balanced diffused light for a variety of flash applications. If you only buy one difusser, this is it! 
11105 4 Great camera. Very easy to use. Takes good underwater pictures and video. Very good product for the price. 
11106 4 Battery charged right up and fits fine. 
11107 4 Good！！！ 
11108 4 Arrived on time and equipment was exactly as offered. Great product, great service, great value!!Only needed charger but for less than the cost of a stand alone charger I got a charger 2 extra batteries and a car charger cord!!! 
11109 4 These pieces are swell, great experience from seller! 
11110 4 Love it 
11111 4 Beautiful. It is perfect for my needs. 
11112 3 used it couple of times and found ok 
11113 3 I recieved the slide converter 1 day early the amazom box was in perfect condition. But package box was slightly damaged but did not affect operation of device. Just started using but don t know about relibility right now works as described. 
11114 3 they work 
11115 4 On time and as promised! 
11116 4 Beautifully designed - perfect 
11117 4 Great video cam. It gives you two hours of time and the pictures are easy to upload. No sim card needed. I swear by Flipshare! 
11118 4 Fit my T3i lens kit perfectly. 
11119 4 Best camera backpack on the market. I have tried a lot of different bags and this one is the best. Size is just right for day hikes. 
11120 4 item arrived promptly and as represented. only used once so far and performed as needed. thanks 
11121 4 Amazing 
11122 4 It s really just neat... not necessary but cool. I use it with the D5500 
11123 3 item was directly as describe 
11124 4 Nice Fit, Well made! love it! 
11125 4 They work great with both my 60d and the 70d. 
11126 3 Great camera! Great quality and tons of accesories. Works great so far! 
11127 4 These worked for me. i have them on my slider, my shoulder rig, my tripod, and its really nice to just swap my camera between all these with no need to change the plate. 
11128 4 perfect, quick delivery! 
11129 4 This is great when I am traveling and have my kids with me and only want to take one camera body and one lens (and still need to tote their sunglasses and my wallet, etc. 
11130 4 I am satisfied 
11131 2 I think the hardware is great but the software is complete trash. This device is unsuitable for security due to the fact that the motion detection has not been enabled in the app yet. Push notifications for motion detection does not work. Returned and refunded. 
11132 4 Perfect case. Great price! 
11133 4 This camera is very well built and the customer service Walter provided to set it up on pc and tablet was super. Thanks for a great product and service! 
11134 4 Small, simple to use and setup; does what it says it will. What s not to like. GoPro offers decent software for editing. So far it s been bulletproof 
11135 4 Good product, timely delivery, works as intended, Good price. Durability? So far so good…. 
11136 0 Not only was this NOT a plug & play device it is plastic cheap Xhina made. Even their Level 2 support cld not fix - wasted THREE HOURS! Returned & bought Nest (drop) cam which is AWESOME wyality & indeed installed instantly!!! Get a Nest cam!!! 
11137 4 This backdrop stand is excellent and well constructed. I am very pleased with it and would recommend it. 
11138 0 Not made for the camera it was pictured with. 
11139 4 Great product. Great quality and stylish. The seller shipped on time as well. 
11140 0 Complete junk, waste of everything, just a scam 
11141 3 Great Value 
11142 4 This has been a great addition to my equipment. It is the just the right size for when I am shooting still life and macro photos. When shooting portraits it can easily be held by your model without interfering in close ups. 
11143 4 It Fit like the original hood. So far I am not disappointed. Would buy again. 
11144 4 GREAT 
11145 4 GREAT PRODUCT. RECOMENDT IT. 
11146 1 It was broken! so bad!!!! 
11147 4 It was worth my Lil change 
11148 2 t I don t like the instruction book being online. Haven t figured out how to view photos online. 
11149 4 Love it! Keep an eye on my dog throughout the day! 
11150 4 As described and delivers promptly 
11151 4 Works as described. Target and Walmart sell an exact monopod for around 45 dollars USD. Have not got it wet yet but cheap enough to buy two, one for the water and land. As plus it comes with a GOPRO tripod mount. (score) 
11152 2 Is a nice product, nicely build. The only problem is the foot holder, It doesnt stay up. At the end I removed from the Monopod. 
11153 4 Lenses were a great deal for the price. Seem to be quality. Definitely would buy again 
11154 4 we should all have them at home never know when you need them 
11155 4 Excellent product. 
11156 4 My order arrived as promised. The D5300 manual is well written and the camera easy to assemble with very intuitive controls. With accessories, this is a ready to shoot package for beginners and experts. 
11157 3 Camcorder worked well although there was some pixiling after using Digital Video Head Cleaner everything worked out well, good buy, satisfied. 
11158 4 Product received, as scheduled, and is just as it is advertised. I am very pleased. 
11159 3 works really well when it s working, my son loves it. It does what it describes, fly really well for a $50 drones. But one of the propeller fails after a few days of heavy use. It becomes useless if one of the propeller fails. 
11160 2 These batteries do work, but don t fit into the slots as easily as the originals. The batteries don t seem to hold as long either. 
11161 0 DOA Returned. 
11162 4 I love this flash! It was inexpensive and does the job I need it to do. 
11163 4 Good 
11164 4 Arrived on time and fit right onto the standard lens for the nikon 1 s1. Works great to reduce lens flare. 
11165 4 This remote works with my Nikon D3100 perfectly. 
11166 2 Awkward to use. Takes three hands to align the hood properly. 
11167 4 Perfect exactly the expected 
11168 4 Was wondeful, gave the camera the grip it needed 
11169 4 Gift 
11170 4 Love old school Polaroids 
11171 4 Great stuff! Works as expected and protects your gopro from occasional loss 
11172 3 Now I am always strapped for when things get messy. 
11173 4 it lasts long enough!! :) 
11174 4 Honestly there are so many uses for this product! We use it in pools the ocean while spearing, surfing, body surfing and just catching family fun. Thanks again for the great product. 
11175 2 Good camera, but returned it as there is no real flash. It comes with a little toy one that looks like an after thought. Great pictures in good light, but there are better options for a little more money. 
11176 4 Sturdy little cap. The string isn t adjustable, so it s kind of useless but doesn t get in the way much. 
11177 4 Absolutely love my new Canon! It s exactly what I wanted and all the added items are great, especially the case. 
11178 4 They are working fine. Thanks. 
11179 4 Came fast. fit great in the camera and work perfectly. 
11180 4 I love this set of reflectors, very pleased! 
11181 4 Great case, holds everything I need. No complaints 
11182 2 Its OK the battery doesn t fit all the way in the charger 
11183 4 the case is not solid red. it is fully clear. the only thing red is the rubber liner that is inside. it will fit 2x iPhone 6 w/ cases on, a wallet, some keys, and pocket knife. 
11184 4 Packed full of capability. A real bargain. At first the latest software did not allow me to register on Lenovo tab, but they quickly remedied the problem. 
11185 4 Excellent camera for a point and shoot. The camera has many great features only found on more expensive cameras. The photo quality is excellent. 
11186 0 Dose not work at all. If cane tack back the one stare I will 
11187 4 Should have came with lens ( Canon ) 
11188 4 Nice price. 
11189 1 Battery life is terrible. Should have looked around for better camera. Price was ok, videos clear. 
11190 2 instructions not very good, could not get the audio to work properly. 
11191 2 Works well but kinda stiff, I like my backpack style better. Larger and bulkier than expected. I find I use the inside case more than the whole thing. 
11192 4 Flawless. 
11193 4 Great 
11194 3 Great Compact case. Perfect for those who do not need to carry around a bunch of different lenses. 
11195 4 easy to use 
11196 4 Works like it should 
11197 3 Not bad for the price, it doesn t work really well with my d810 but is pretty handy for smaller cameras, (I cant reach all the neccasary buttons on the larger dslrs) 
11198 4 Great item 
11199 4 Well they are Sony lens caps which is what I needed. 
11200 0 Total Junk Camera s do NOT buy... they didn t work, period.... fuzzy picture for a while then no picture 
11201 4 High quality well made compact unit. Easy to carry and use. 
11202 4 Well made pouches. I prefer these to the larger cases because they can be packed anywhere. 
11203 3 Works fine but loose in socket 
11204 4 It works as it should. 
11205 4 Perfect! Just what I needed for my next project! 
11206 3 Canon top quality & has the space I need. Only objection I have is the lack of a zippered top closure instead of the Velcro fastener option. It s noises & I don t feel as secure with my gear without a zipper closure. Maybe just me 
11207 3 Too small for necklaces, and not enough lighting even in a brightly lit room. Otherwise great product. 
11208 2 Doesn t take great out of water photos, but hints why it s an underwater camera! 
11209 4 Nice 
11210 4 love it 
11211 4 Does the job, like the price! 
11212 3 Hah Go Pro nervana 
11213 4 Excellent camera took great vacation photos 
11214 4 Bought it for a gift. My daughter was thrilled!! 
11215 4 Nice frame i make my wife happy with this frame with all our goo moments & memories 
11216 4 Fits perfectly into my Okley backpack 
11217 4 Perfect 
11218 4 Used to replace two flooded o. e. cams out of 8 in my system. Exceeded expectations for a unit with this low price. Much better resolution and color rendition than o.e.., and much better mounting brackets. Will use them in the future as the others give out 
11219 3 Quality and price are great. I wish the threads weren t so darn long though. I m just posting this so the MNF might consider shortening them? :D 
11220 4 This camera is awesome and you can t beat the price. The best thing that I like is that the screen on the camera is so very clear and easy to use...will have lots of fun with this for years to come 
11221 4 took a little while to get it to work. has been great since with no issues. 
11222 3 Really easy to install. And love that I can get real time on my phone. Just download app and set up account good to go. Love it 
11223 4 Very satisfied. 
11224 0 Its not good for my canon t3 after a couple of shots it tells me the communication between the lens in the body are not compatible I have to clean the connectors this lens is s***** 
11225 0 The product is very low quality. It is cheaply made and does not work properly at all. 
11226 4 This is an awesome scope. 
11227 3 Looks like it will do the trick. Fairly comfortable and constructed well. 
11228 4 A really good camera for point and shoot. Has an amazing zoom, shoots quickly, has some special filters and stuff 
11229 4 100 % recomendable 
11230 4 Great kit for anyone with a go pro ! 
11231 4 I love the pouch they came in, and they work really well! 
11232 4 happy about it 
11233 4 Good charger I use it as an extra works perfect 
11234 4 Works perfectly for our smaller waterproof camera and allows it to easily float in the pool rather than sink to the bottom. 
11235 2 good product. 
11236 4 Right angle plug much better than straight plug. 
11237 4 Awesome in every way-- I bought this for a trip to Yosemite in August--was the perfect lens for my GH4-- 
11238 1 Like many things somethings you can not buy cheap What I am looking for is about 300/500 dollar range. 
11239 3 well made. good price. 
11240 4 Good 
11241 0 It was working now it keeps disconnecting. I dont know whats going on 
11242 4 Great camera, came with all cables and parts. very high quality. 
11243 2 This item does what it is designed for. It does feel flimsy and make you worried that your flash will fall but it holds up. It works. 
11244 3 Works as well as original, but a tiny bit thicker making it difficult to eject from camera. 
11245 4 Super fast shipping & fit my Nikon perfectly 
11246 3 Great protection. 
11247 0 Not ready for prime time. After countless hours with their support, we could not get it to work. Had no choice but to return it. 
11248 4 Suction works well! Tried it on my wind shield and my surf Board and held up pretty tight! 
11249 4 A solid kit for any sort of standard photography uses! I used it successfully in cleaning both my sensor and my lenses. It is a great deal and definitely something to look into. 
11250 4 This is a fantastic lens. I can t recommend it enough. 
11251 0 I had to return it. Bad flash & one of the batteries were also bad. It was after 30 days & Amazon would not accept my return!!! 
11252 4 Good courteous job, with full satisfaction. 
11253 4 The best starter Professional tripod you can find. I would recommend this tripod any one who wants to start off with a awesome tripod. if your worried if it s shakey it s totally not super sturddy and can put it anywhere 
11254 4 Its a nice product. Came in safe and secure package. Got that nice look. So far I like it. 
11255 4 Sibling used this on his backpacking trip to Japan. Camera came back! The clip is really sturdy, there is no fear of the camera falling off. Great product! 
11256 4 great. 
11257 4 Very nice 
11258 4 I have been Pelican fan for some time and have picked up 7 bags so far! The best case for camera lenses. 
11259 4 Good quality and price 
11260 4 One of the best DYI system available on the market. 
11261 3 Better than the GoPro battery 
11262 4 Great case! Great quality. Perfect for my needs. 
11263 4 good price 
11264 4 Really like this camera 
11265 4 Perfect! 
11266 3 Fun to use. Very versatile. Held Canon Rebel ESO T3i stable and level. Hooked to a tree limb. :) 
11267 4 perfect 
11268 4 Love it. Very good starter Go Pro. Will eventually upgrade but this one is great for starters 
11269 3 I probably would have paid another $10 for GoPro s frame mount with the quick release. However this works too except the CamKix frame mount got caught in the front faceplate and bent the corner of it! Good thing these are replaceable. 
11270 4 Great little filters for the cutest camera ever, 
11271 4 Great bag for video gadgets. Well made and good cushion. 
11272 4 Has worked great ever since I bought it 
11273 3 Works great!:) 
11274 4 Extremely usefull and recomended to protect the camera. Canon 70D fits perfectly. 
11275 4 very happy with purchase 
11276 4 Durable. Reliable. Well-made. Great value! 
11277 3 This is a very affordable remote. I would recommend taking out the battery when not in use. I have found the battery dead several times. After being stored for a short time. 
11278 4 Excellent product. 
11279 4 My 1st one [exactly the same] was stolen, so I liked it so much I got another one. I ll be more careful this time. 
11280 4 Bought this for my Husband while he was out to sea. He used it constantly in rough conditions and it held up amazing. He filmed awesome footage of aircraft and similar events and he said it was extremely easy to use. 
11281 4 This gadget proved to be very helpful and convenient! 
11282 1 confusing instruction and battery not charging. 
11283 4 Very easy to set up and use. I have gotten amazing footage thanks to it on my bike! 
11284 4 Good telephoto lens in well lit situations. 
11285 4 amazing 
11286 4 They are sturdy forceful clamps. I like them fine so far. 
11287 0 CAN NOT fit my D750 as the title described!!!!! Please change the item title and the description!!! 
11288 2 These have a tendency to unscrew as you use it. I m thinking about taking it off 
11289 4 It really protects the camera and is easy to use. It can be used with the kit zoom, the Panasonic 14mm, and the Panasonic 20mm. The front cover doesn t fit when the Olympus 25mm is used, but you can still half cover that fits on the camera. 
11290 3 Exactly what I expected for the money. I wish the bars could be a little shorter, though. Too long with three bars, too short with two. Oh well, the price was right. 
11291 4 These are great! And the case to carry them in is perfect! 
11292 0 The camera is fine. 
11293 0 The NVR is dead after 7 months. Front panel light are dark. Also ... The cameras require Microsoft Windows to configure. Cannot access without an unsecure and unsigned Active-x IE plugin. This system is useless to users with real computers. Linux users beware. 
11294 4 Works great! Must buy for any photographer, amateur or pro. 
11295 4 just the item i need. 
11296 4 This bulb is really big. But it does put out a very nice and bright light. I m using it to light a painting area. Would not recommend using this for regular lamps due to size. 
11297 4 This is a really good value. You get a ton of paper for a very small price. 
11298 0 Not working with Control4... 
11299 0 Didn t work well broke, but I got what I paid for 
11300 4 Awesome camera!!!! Lots of features that I will need to learn how of use..Uploading to internet is a breezy!!! 
11301 4 This item is exactly what I have been looking for. My SLR is very heavy and I have been looking for some way to distribute the weight. 
11302 4 Have everything I need for my sj4000 adventures ;) 
11303 0 PIXDIGITAL is not an approved NIKON dealer (called 3rd Party by NIKON). Subsequently NIKON will not honor their warranty on the camera. 
11304 4 It is well worth getting these chargers when you add the battery pack to your camera. 
11305 3 Works great, lightweight and nicely straps to wrist when your up a ladder! 
11306 4 Works. Fast shipping. Easy setup. Great picture. 
11307 4 This is a great wifi camera, very easy setup We use it everyday to keep an eye on our dogs. 
11308 4 100% good 
11309 0 Did not work well with android note 3 
11310 1 I love the light from this. I can t use it because on the two location shoots I ve brought it out, half of the support ribs have broken. 
11311 4 I used i this on my panasonic ag-ac 90, It works excellent. No humming or background noise like other mics in the price range. 
11312 4 It fits snug on my flash and does a great job of changing the light of the flash. 
11313 2 I feel like this product is a little half-baked, they rushed it to market and it isn t great. The shogun is great, but I m considering finding a third-party sun-hood. 
11314 3 Good price on these batteries, and they arrived before I expected them to. 
11315 3 seems to be doing a great job as of yet! smudging is a bit temperamental when it happens.. but I wipe it with a lens cloth and it seems to do the trick 
11316 4 Great product for the price. Shipping was fast. The battery life only lasted about an hour, but for price I was still happy with the product. 
11317 4 It works great on portraits. I recommend this also to my friends. 
11318 4 I ordered this thinking that it was a wireless, returned it without a hassle when I got it. 
11319 4 Great camera 
11320 0 So bad it s not worth a review.. useless junk. 
11321 4 A convenient little bag to hold my t3i camera and its lens. It s just what I needed. However, if you wanted to carry extra lenses, this would not be a good bag for you. 
11322 4 Sony is very good 
11323 0 The easiest waist of money, doesn t work AT ALL. 
11324 4 good price and product. 
11325 4 Thanks 
11326 4 Works as described and reasonably priced. 
11327 4 Just what I needed, great price and fast shipping 
11328 3 Loved these! Eventually the clamp tips did snap or break off so not sure if that s normal wear and tear or if I did something that caused it. Just used it to clamp fabric onto my photography backdrop stand. 
11329 4 Great value for the price, my son love it because of unbelievable quality. 
11330 4 so far so good 
11331 2 not always focused, not enough zoom for me 
11332 2 This works if you bounce it off the ceiling 
11333 4 Fast delivery, good product 
11334 4 Same color as described. Lovely grass green Great thick quality as usual 
11335 4 works great 
11336 4 I m a 10 year old girl and got this camera from my grandparents. I like the camera because I can go underwater with it, and I can take selfies, and I like the color choices. 
11337 0 The camera software is not compatible with my smartphone ... no version available for other cell phones or tablets 
11338 3 Haven t used it yet but it is charging 
11339 4 Awesome product and for the price? Da boooomb! I love it. The shots are smooth and I look like a pro. Awesome. 
11340 4 NIce lens hood, looks well made, gets the job done. 
11341 4 It seem good for the price, i will use it and update the review. 
11342 4 Really clear sound for the cheap price. Sucks the cord is short so can t do long distance stuff, and the wind shield fell off super easily so it s lost forever. 
11343 4 Works well, stays on glass and holds up my point and shoot, no complaints here! 
11344 1 The lense bends the horizon on the peripherals, the software will not load on my iPad. The system seems to be incompatible with my 64bit windows app. There were no prohibitive warnings at the time of purchase. Kind of a rip off, Nothing works as expected. 
11345 2 Shutter button would have been nice... 
11346 4 Clever system that works for us. Not intended as a full time security system but more peace of mind when away. Could do with some sort of IFTTT integration or one of the smart home systems - maybe on the way if so then systems get even better. 
11347 4 A 
11348 4 AAAAA+++++ 
11349 4 I use it as babay monitor and it works very well, I can see the stutas everywhere. recommened. 
11350 4 Amazing camera! My daughter loves it! 
11351 4 The lenz arrived on time and works great 
11352 4 Love this case! Looks great and fits my Samsung WB35F smart camera great! Just a little snug at first but stretches just enough to fit perfectly! 
11353 4 Love this tripod. Definitely sturdy. 
11354 4 I was a little nervous about buying a refurbished camera, but I have not had any issues with it and it takes beautiful pics. 
11355 4 very nice and slim 
11356 4 New and delivered on time. Great deal. 
11357 0 Would not recommend 
11358 4 Great image quality, fast lens at low cost. Plastic mount is durable. No focus scale and lens hood. I would get the FA 50 1.4 if I was more professional. Great lens for cost conscious enthusiast without sacrificing image quality. 
11359 4 Delivery was on timeach and the charger has a great overall value. 
11360 3 Very nice product, doesn t have the quality feel that more expensive ones have, but performs great nonetheless. Only problems I had was the battery door not staying shut occasionally, and the foot being plastic, I broke it while removing it from the camera. 
11361 4 Camera works very well. It does generate quite a bit of heat, but the image is very nice. 
11362 4 Excellent camera, good quality and clear image. 
11363 3 Muy buenos 
11364 4 it came with a bag, camera strap and 32 gb memory card. Thanks 
11365 4 Great product, used it for 2 years in our office. No falsies, no problems. Calls up to 3 phone numbers when activated. Perfect for small businesses located in a big building without security. Door opening and motion activated, strongly recommend. Not for high security. 
11366 4 the batteries and charger worked as expected, the items were delivered as promised on time with no issues. A seamless transaction as it should be. 
11367 4 I have had no issues with this. Fits my Canon 70D with a longer lens on it. Great for everyday use. 
11368 3 Easy to operate. Slides sometimes hang up inside. Otherwise - light is bright, picture is good. Did not try negatives. 
11369 3 When used with various Lowepro bags and their utility belt, this is a great way to distribute weight and reduce the strain on my shoulders (already an issue with two Nikon DSLRs). 
11370 3 This was for a Granddaughter, so I don t know about the performance. I did get it in just a couple of days, so I was very happy about that. 
11371 4 As advertised. Solid construction and fits perfectly on my 400 Rebel XTi. The ability to use either standard batteries or 2 battery packs make this quite versatile. I ve used it with the battery packs and it lasts a long time. I recommend this product. 
11372 4 I have been using this camera for a few weeks now, and I have been completely with its performance. Expecially when you get into it more advanced features like the multi frame noise reduction and HDR. my wife loves the creativity while in auto mode 
11373 4 Good for the price. Really creates the appearance of a TV 
11374 4 Awesome product great the building custom iPhone rigs 
11375 4 Excellent 
11376 4 Cant beat the price fast charge and always have a battery for my canon D30 camera 
11377 4 Exactly what I wanted for my T5i...snug fit with kit lens. Will offer the protection I was looking for. Snug around body and long enough to cover lens plus straps secure to each other. 
11378 4 sharp, rich colors on my 7R2 
11379 4 Fantastic for the price! Great accessory for macro lighting! 
11380 4 Love this camera. With the bundle you have everything you need. 
11381 4 Great product very good prise fast shipment I recommend. 
11382 4 Perfect. Flexible and lightweight. 
11383 4 I got it, what more do you want. 
11384 4 Lens is great. I am highly satisfied! 
11385 3 Great 200 ISO color negative film. Seem to shoot a little blue for me, I have been editing this during scanning. 
11386 4 I like it. 
11387 2 Product works as advertised. However, like other reviewers have said, it is very hard to remove the lens. I have resorted to using a flat blade screwdriver to get in there to unlock the pin so I can remove the lens from the adapter. 
11388 4 Works great, just what i needed. Great distance, worked well out of range while camping even. 
11389 4 Take the time to balance and it works great. The grip tries to slide though. 
11390 3 Not much to say. I m happy with this product. 
11391 4 Excellent binoculars. I can see far goes perfectly with this product that is not too expensive. I am satisfied 
11392 4 Product is light weight and feels durable. Metal GoPro attachment point is a big plus for confidence that your GoPro is staying put. GREAT customer service! 
11393 4 Easy to use. Well worth the price 
11394 0 stopped working after a week 
11395 1 Do not buy this camera as a deterrent, it is only meant to fill in spots that real cameras might miss. If this is the only camera, in about a week everyone will know it is fake. 
11396 2 Ok 
11397 4 Bright back light, Clear view in bright and sunny conditions outdoors. Long action time on high capacity battery (2 days of use between charges.). Only came with short MiniHDMI to HDMI patch cable and no pigtail for the analog av input. Would have also liked a 12vDC pigtail as well. 
11398 4 Just what I was looking for 
11399 4 Works as intended. 
11400 3 good camara but didn t realise that it didn t have share options 
11401 4 It is just the size (a medium, despite the description) for my needs, falling between a couple of smaller bags and a larger system bag. It certainly seems sturdy and well designed. I opted for the orange interior to make finding the small odds and ends easier. 
11402 1 Pain to install and uninstall. Does not fit in case with guards on... 
11403 4 Takes great pictures! 
11404 4 ok;-))) 
11405 4 Love it! 
11406 4 I love my Manfrotto! 
11407 4 It came exactly as the description said it would. It s adorable and unique. 
11408 4 Bought one of these for my 70D and it works great. But no surprise there - I have bought SterlingTek batteries for my other DSLRs (40D & G12) and they have always been excellent and cost-effective. Highly recommended! 
11409 0 This is not a UNIVERSAL AC ADAPTOR, it does not fit into my device 
11410 4 This little camera works awesome for a whole bunch of different applications from underwater to live shows and for the price you can t really find something this good I think. 
11411 4 Fit my filters fine. A nice additional to my Cannon SX520 outfit. Well worth the price. 
11412 4 The frame works great and has a great picture. The directions for use after set up could be better but, even I figured out how to navigate the web site. 
11413 4 Great mic, low hiss 
11414 4 Happy 
11415 4 Received on time and in perfect condition. Works very well with no issues. Recommended product 
11416 3 Worked as advertised. Expensive way to print out pics. 
11417 4 This is a very simple device and so far it has worked as advertised. The item is supposed to be built by Foto&Teck but it carries the name &#34;Lynca&#34;. It works and it is very inexpensive. 
11418 4 These work great! 
11419 4 I bought this initially for my binoculars to use at concerts but took it to Boston last weekend and paired it up with my camera and it was great. It s light, compact, and steadies your shots beautifully. 
11420 4 High quality and worked fantastic! 
11421 4 All seems in order. I got this to view the Blood Moon in September 2015. And to view our wonderful night sky on other occasions. Packs easily in the backpack (included). Nice value. 
11422 4 Extremely light and EXTREMELY loud. You pull the top loop off the Robocopp to turn it on, and it s very secure so you can be sure it won t go off automatically. It s sturdy, well-designed, and as I said, it s LOUD!! 
11423 0 Ok 
11424 4 Awesome build quality and functionality! gonna buy more for my class. 
11425 4 excellent 
11426 4 it is very well 
11427 4 Awesome camera! Plenty of features, easy to handle, and takes absolutely splendid pictures! 
11428 2 They do the job of an extension tube, but feel very cheap. My lenses have also become stuck every now and then, but still easy to remove. 
11429 4 Great siren. Has decent volume 
11430 4 Great Product 
11431 4 Battery was great. Last double of the one that came with it. 
11432 4 Great tripod, very light weight but sturdy. I can now get close-ups without movement by using the bluetooth remote control button. 
11433 4 Great product. and it s a Tiffen even better. 
11434 4 Good quality...good price...timely shipping. 
11435 2 Works! but probably would not withstand rough handling. JC 
11436 4 Fits my old camera perfectly thanks ^^ 
11437 2 What can I say, it works......got tired of fooling with this and just put velcro on the speed light..... 
11438 3 Good price 
11439 4 Great Product 
11440 4 works great. 
11441 4 The batteries are working well so far. I don t live them overnight for charging. They will get hot if you do. The charger is fine too. But you should charge one battery at a time. 
11442 4 So far so good. Arrived earlier than promised. Have used a few times with excellent results. This was purchased for a Canon 60D. 
11443 4 There is a reason why products like this from Manfrotto are more expensive.... They are grade A quality and you can tell. The movement of this head and the incredibly sleek build are perfect for video and/or photo. You get what you pay for! 
11444 4 The best lens I d owned so far. 
11445 3 Very good, but it doesn t quite have the range of configuration I was hoping for. I could probably use on with slightly longer arms. Mechanically, it is solid. 
11446 4 Great product, as expected!! 
11447 4 Worked very well. It attached to my Canon t2i and helped me take some great pictures. 
11448 4 Perfect. 
11449 4 Equal, in my opinion, to high-priced brand name filter sets. 
11450 4 Works perfectly on my Canon T3i and 7D Mark II 
11451 4 These cells actually had more juice then my OEM battery. Highly recommend this product. 
11452 3 Got the wrong size case but it works good for something else I am using it for 
11453 4 It is very good 
11454 4 Great product! Easy to position. Stays wear you put it. 
11455 4 I like it 
11456 4 very good ! 
11457 4 Very happy with them!! 
11458 3 works just fine 
11459 3 Product met all my expectations, price competitive and delivery quick. What else can one add? 
11460 4 A++++++ 
11461 4 so far great lens, very low light pic looks good shooting with nikon d7100 iso250 f2.8 new camera and lens my bluecloud. 
11462 3 The product was delivered in a timely manner. It was purchased for a new Canon 70D DSLR. It fits well, but it is a bit loose. It falls off in my camera bag, as I m removing the camera. While using the camera there is no problem. 
11463 3 Very clear, bright image with accurate color. Weight is not too great for easy carrying considering the magnification and objective lens diameter. Lens caps are awkward in use. 
11464 4 small enough to put in my back pack but not big enough to carry everything you want in it 
11465 4 need to include attachment instructions 
11466 1 Hi, it came in a bundle. Big, spacious, but the twinkle that makes when you walk is just too annoying. 
11467 4 it s comfortable for the dogs, put on snug it holds up very well to even my most active dog. Running jumping swimming! Keeps position and gives a great view!!!! 
11468 4 works great 
11469 0 There are much more effective staff on the market. But I found how and where to apply it. Good for the price. 
11470 4 This is a nice protective cover for the price. It fits my Canon SX40 nicely and fits in your pocket when not in use. 
11471 4 Works well! 
11472 3 product was as advertised. shipment was quick. 
11473 0 The gaps (in the way the cover closes) reflect on all of the photos. 
11474 4 fits the 18-55mm lens perfectly. 
11475 4 Great but needed assistance to setup 
11476 4 Indiana Jones asked me where I got this and how much it cost. He offered to exchange this for his leather pouch; but, I didn t accept the trade. 
11477 3 Product was as advertised and a great buy for the price, shipping was on time and the tripod works with a number of different cameras. A worthwhile purchase 
11478 4 Good deal for the price. Has every piece needed to enjoy the camera. 
11479 3 My purpose for this camera was to watch my dog. I love it. I can also talk to him which is awesome. To be able to scan the room Is a great feature. Highly recommend this product. 
11480 4 plenty of run time with this pack 
11481 4 Great light as a great price 
11482 0 cannot connect as wireless unit have done everything - useless 
11483 4 Easy to program. 
11484 4 Everything was as stated. All accessories were as described. Arrived on time. Product is excellent 
11485 4 light & durable, we will see how it lasts the test of time. 
11486 4 These are great! You can place them on windows or doors and they will chime or sound an alarm when one is opened. Definitely beats paying a high price for alarm monitoring. 
11487 4 I just needed somethin to see my driveway area. Easy to hook up and works great 
11488 4 I got this camera since a friend of mine has it and I saw it working. It works for me as a baby monitor. I had no issues installing and setting up it. Like it! 
11489 4 Charger does a fine job and fits the battery well. 
11490 2 A few times after using my GoPro with this case for a while in the water, the lens on the case begins to fog up a bit. From time to time I have to disassemble the case in order to wipe the inside which becomes a bit inconvenient. 
11491 4 Very happy with the batteries, charger and all at half the price. Great deal! I was so happy that it arrived early so I could take it with me on vacation! 
11492 4 Worked Better than expected !! 
11493 4 Is a great tool for beginners as well as pros, and takes amazing shots! Lightweight and high quality! 
11494 4 Nice 
11495 4 easy to operate. Husband has a very large wrist fits him perfect 
11496 4 This battery works very well with my external HD dsiplay monitor used for my camcorder. Battery discharge lasted for the time expected. Recharge time depends on the charger, but I had no issues iwth this item. 
11497 4 excellent product 
11498 1 Too many parts not as easy to install as expected 
11499 4 great camera and cheap 
11500 4 Purchased this item to replace a broken contact on sliding glass door. Item arrived quickly, was exactly as represented in the description, was easy to install. 
11501 4 This camera is my baby, I highly recommend it to anyone who loves photography. Plus you can t beat a touch screen display ! 
11502 3 i like it. great ! 
11503 4 PERFECT!!!! Works great! Sooo easy. We have the GoPro4 mounted on our roll cage of our RZR... I put this remote on my wrist and control it from my seat. 
11504 2 sometimes the control of the lens through this extension not work but still good addition to my gear. 
11505 3 My son really liked the camera and it looks to have a good seal. Should come with some small memory stick. 
11506 1 This was more of a pain to use than it was worth. The clips don t allow for for flexible positioning. We had to use our clamps instead. More for studio use than field use. 
11507 3 work good no problems yet 
11508 4 Just what I wanted. 
11509 4 It s a battery. It works. 
11510 4 These work very well for getting a better position on the camera. Along with a set of straights, there are only a few positions that are not possible. 
11511 4 Simple and durable. 
11512 4 Only used couple of times but works good 
11513 4 It is just perfect! 
11514 4 Great filter. Now I can shoot video in sunny condition with low aperture and fixed shutter speed. Good deal! 
11515 4 As Described 
11516 3 Definitely a little too expensive for what it gives you but it does perform well. 
11517 3 Great value, good quality kit, seems solid. 
11518 4 higher quality 
11519 4 Perfect size case for all my gear. Make sure to get the lid organizer too. 
11520 4 Have a wide range of lenses for my Lumix DMC-GM5...but this lens has quickly become my absolute favorite... 
11521 4 The camera was clean and has performed great shooting sports for two weeks. 
11522 3 Rounded ones fit well on the top of my 8hp Johnson motor. I also used one on the dashboard of my jeep. Also worked perfect. 
11523 4 Best bang for the buck in a 4K camera, I m very impressed with the resolution and capabilities, I d been discovered its potential day by day. 
11524 4 The charger works perfectly with my original battery and getting the extra pair of batteries means I can shoot for days before needing to recharge. 
11525 4 Works great and easy to program. 
11526 2 I bought this device from this seller based on the reviews. The device is not the one pictured, but is identical to the cheapest looking, lower rated models. Don t make the mistake I made. Don t pay extra for looks and reviews. 
11527 4 Nice and compact case! And WOW for customer service! They wanted to make sure I was happy with the product and followed up with me immediately on a question I had. 
11528 4 Husband LOVES it! 
11529 4 Works as they say. Easy to install easy to use. 
11530 4 Product works great. Got it the next day! 
11531 4 fits perfect, but it should, both case and camera are Sony 
11532 4 Wife likes it in her buisness. Mail n more. Thinking of buying another one for the new restaurant. 
11533 4 Very nice just what I wanted. It did not disappoint. Durable and beautiful for photos 
11534 4 Good camera! Good delivery 
11535 4 Other reviews state that the rolls don t have an expiration date but I used it for the Dallas Cowboys training camp, the pictures are great. Product arrived before specified date. 
11536 4 Camera is one of the best of this type on the market. Quick setup and excellent support if needed. Just call Walter and he can provide you with excellent help & support 
11537 4 Excellent hi resolution video surveillance camera, can be controlled remotely so it can pan and zoom remotely provides good color video when there is enough light and monochrome video using infrared in the dark. 
11538 4 Best buy for the money! 
11539 4 great 
11540 4 Fits perfectly on my Canon 18-135 STM lens. I can zoom wide and it s not in the picture. It also doesn t stop me from being able to put the lens cap on when I m done with the camera. It s everything I needed for this lens. 
11541 3 The batteries doesn t hold the charge as well as the actual fujifilm battery I have. I noticed if I don t use the batteries after charging them, they slowly lose charge. So they are not amazing, but work as expected. 
11542 2 It worked great until the attenna broke off. It is touchy, will try again and be more careful. Otherwise it worked as it is supposed to. 
11543 3 The colors are not as vivid as I would like, but far superior to my last photo frame. I have not a explored all its capabilities, but it appears it will do more than I will ever use. It is a good value and well worth its price. 
11544 1 Not great but works 
11545 3 For the money, this is a nice quality case. Bought it for a Phantom 3. The hell fits great. Had to do a few small cuts for the controller. But it was easy with an electric kitchen knife. Not as sturdy as a hard case, but good basic protection. 
11546 4 very good 
11547 4 good 
11548 4 Worked perfectly 
11549 4 So happy I can find instant film at a low price! 
11550 4 Danny was very helpful with the problems I was having setting up my camera. The camera is very clear 
11551 4 Everything Perfect! 
11552 4 Incredibly solid, microscopic precision machining and tolerances, and superb build quality! A real winner! 
11553 4 excellent 
11554 3 Great WiFi camera for the price...easy to set up 
11555 2 at my second month it broke 
11556 4 nice product 
11557 4 as good as a go pro kess expensive 
11558 4 Got to use it once, then strapped on the chesty mount to paddle board and the gopro popped out and sank to the bottom of the Willamette River during Redbull Flugtag in Portland. Should have just been using this. Oops 
11559 4 Light and cute camera! Comes with a lot of accessories. Video/photo is sharp and clear. Also the price is so much better than GoPro. 
11560 3 Very good quality and very light. 
11561 3 Excellent monopod. It comes with a phone holder and it is also good for camera. Most importantly, it locks, which allows to install a phone or a camera without any fears. It looks sturdy, I hope it will last. It comes with phone holder and a screw for Gopro. 
11562 3 Pretty small, but does work. 
11563 4 Excelllent Product and great price 
11564 4 Excellent! Exactly what I was expecting. 
11565 4 Henry Campbell was very helpful in solving my camera issues. Henry was very diligent in making sure my issues were resolved. Foscam has excellent products. I recently bought 2 more Foscam wireless cameras. 
11566 3 These work pretty well and last a reasonable length of time (without using the flash, though I ve read LION AA batteries last longer.) Having 2 batteries means you always have a spare ready to go if 1 batteries gives out. And it was a good deal. 
11567 4 I have a camera like this, love it. Got this one for a friend. 
11568 3 Great product 
11569 0 It blew..... amazon gave me a refund, also I would have given it 0 stars if I could 
11570 4 perfect fit for my eos t3i as good as new piece 
11571 4 Use this on my Canon T3 and T5i; works fantastic. Fast lens for a low price. 
11572 3 This item arrived in good condition. It will come in handy when I need to clean my camera and looks like a quality item. I received this item at a discount for my honest opinion. 
11573 4 Good items! 
11574 4 Super product! 
11575 4 Very heavy duty and will protect my camera gear without any worries. 
11576 4 good 
11577 3 Takes a bit of patience to dial in motion sensitivity so that it doesn t record anything that moves. Make sure to schedule reboot at least once per week. Dlink app is ok. Saving recordings to network drive performs better than to sandisk. 
11578 4 great batteries and prompt shipping. 
11579 4 Don t pay for the name brand. This an amazing product. All in the family have loved using it. Riding water crafts, swimming with dolphins and surfing it is uP to the task. 
11580 4 Product was as described, and delivered as scheduled.The quality is excellent and does the job perfectly. 
11581 3 We have a great picture. Very pleased. 
11582 0 Worst video security camera I have ever used. 
11583 4 Good Boom stand for the price..will do the job if you don t want to break the bank. Received this boom stand pretty fast. So far it has been very sturdy and I ve had no problems whatsoever. 
11584 4 perfect no problem what so over. 
11585 4 My Nordic waterproof camera floats work as expected. They are keeping my valuable cameras safe in, and around the water. 
11586 3 Great Update 
11587 4 I ve long wanted the SLR-Zoom GorillaPod and when it went on sale I couldn t pass up on it. I use it for my Samsung NX1 and 16-50mm S lens - it works as intended and don t have to worry about hitting the weight limit! 
11588 2 It s a great tripod for beginners who haven t used one before. I noticed that when I tried to adjust it some washers and bolts actually fell off of it. But besides that, it works great. 
11589 4 Works great on glass. Customer Service was excellent and I was contacted by the owner to ensure everything was satisfactory. Where else can you find customer service this good. Will definitely buy from a service that cares for their customers. 
11590 1 I might have to return it Didn t come with manuel on how to use Fits my camera but when I take a picture it comes up errow try cleaning lenses 
11591 4 I needed something compact for spare lenses. These are perfect. I love the cinch cord with hooks so I can clip them to other items or my bag. The padding offers extra cushion to protect the lens. Great value. 
11592 4 Awesome quad copter!! My sone LOVES it!!! 
11593 4 This greatly exceeded my expectations. It s easy to setup and is nicely made, considering its very modest price. Now I only need to pull out the big roll of seamless paper for large items. This is perfect for items up to about to about the size of a basketball. 
11594 4 Holds all my gear safely. Lots of room for stuff. 
11595 4 Great little camera. The only potential problem are the on and off switch, gets stuck from time to time. 
11596 4 Great value 
11597 1 Too complicated. 
11598 4 Great product and great price. I would purchase again. Best Buy didn t carry the batteries, but they sold the camera that needed them. Go figure. 
11599 4 ok 
11600 4 These batteries may not last as long as the Canon ones, but they have lasted me for three years and still kicking! 
11601 2 works ok but to small and to heavy 
11602 4 It was the item I ordered and perfect for transferring pics. 
11603 4 Love, Love, Love this! I will order another one just to have for events. Using this one for my photo booth at my party and the second one will be used just for a second prop to have a different background for pictures. Very professional looking. 
11604 3 Good for quick carry, doesn t take all your lenses and accessories. 
11605 4 Still holds up well. I needed something to protect my camera. I love this cover. 
11606 3 Good 
11607 4 Worked great 
11608 0 Don t waste your money! 
11609 4 I bought a Nikon camera and this cable wasn t included. Anyway I thought I needed it and this cable worked perfectly 
11610 4 Love the product, like how it attaches to my camera very easily and quickly while trying them out.. it would be nice if they make included a red and orange color one too, maybe in the future they will.. 
11611 4 These are great octoboxes for the price. I can t speak to their durability as I only use them indoor in a studio, but for my purposes they work great! 
11612 4 Got it for Zukio 12-40mm f/2.8 Pro 
11613 4 Perfect for the mobius does feel a bit make shift but works exactly as it should. 
11614 4 Securing your property have never been easier while at the same time being able to be done with such quality as it is now possible with EasyN IP camera,High quality video makes me happily to monitor my store.I will buy more. 
11615 4 Fits great, works great. Does exactly what it s supposed to do ... 
11616 4 great service and price 
11617 4 The best drone for professional and safe pilots who respect the art. 
11618 4 My grandson loves them. 
11619 4 Cute and works well to keep the camera afloat! 
11620 0 camera would not work with my iphone ,appel 5s. The app kept dropping info and I had to re enter. 
11621 1 Board snapped 1st day on set. Gaff tape kept it together mostly. Rain started to wash colors off the sticks 
11622 4 Great price and great product. Can be used to charge Wasabi and GoPro battery. Gives a lot of flexibility. 
11623 1 To those who say it will not fit the SX520 - they are right. It does not even come close. It does appear to be a classy case, somewhat retro which I like. Too bad it does not fit the SX520. 
11624 2 its ok but now with more gear the bag is to small need bigger one 
11625 4 its great and the color match the camera, 
11626 3 Works perfectly 
11627 4 I Love This Film 
11628 4 Good 
11629 0 worst product ever, no instuctions sent it back for full refund...still cost me $300.00 to find out it would not work I also sent message to amazon to let them know 
11630 3 The filter holder is padded and, protects the unused filters. I consider this to be a very nice value for the money. 
11631 3 An inexpensive way to adjust the flash on the a6000. Works well. 
11632 3 It is a good semi professional camera. The only problem is sometimes gets hard to get focus. 
11633 1 grainy video 
11634 1 Very flimsy album and will not order it again 
11635 4 This is an amzing tripod. Especially for the price. It has everything you need. I just don t recommend taking it outside if its windy but besides that it s wonderful. You should really buy this 
11636 4 I love my Nikon Coolpix. It takes great photos in low light and has a powerful zoom. I only wish it were smaller and lighter, but you can t have it all. 
11637 4 I can say nothing bad about this camera, was so usefull for my photography class, and even after the class i ve still been using it! Great deal over all 10/10! 
11638 0 Would not take the information for the protection. How can you register your product if the website will not take the information. NOT GOOD! I feel like SmartGuard took my money - no coverage of product. 
11639 3 Great picture quality without that &#34;fish-eye&#34; look, night vision works well ( unless pay higher $ for infrared cams ) No problem with cables and power adaptor. 
11640 3 I really enjoyed it. It works as expected. However, it kind of sucks that it only takes 8 pictures, especially with it being so expensive. 
11641 4 Rather than digging up the wire when I moved the PTZ camera I purchased a replacement cable. Good quality, works as it should. 
11642 1 The shipping was really fast but the product came damaged so I wasn t able to take it on my vacation as planned. Not sure if it happened during shipping or what 
11643 2 Leather? No it is not. But, not too bad 
11644 2 Poor performance out of box. Need to be collimated. Celestron may charge you extra to do it. Once collimated, works fine. 
11645 4 Fit perfectly and does it s job well. I m a happy customer.(: 
11646 4 These cases are very nice, plenty of room for the gear and it rolls well. Two man carry handles work great. 
11647 4 Lots of really cool things in here. Some of the items I had no idea what they were for. When I googled them I got inspired with cool new things to try with my GoPro 
11648 0 Can t get it to work.went step by step.records nothing 
11649 4 This is a really nice &#34;bundle&#34; I gave it as a gift and thought it was a good camera with some good accessories. 
11650 2 My daughter received it OK. However, I apparently ordered the wrong one because it didn t charge her camera. Thanks 
11651 4 a perfect replacement for the original Eyepiece cup that comes on the camera. 
11652 4 Good product. 
11653 1 The device refuses to recognize the internal hard drive. Cameras work, but the system will not record. 
11654 0 Far smaller than appears in photo 
11655 3 So far so good. 
11656 4 Great addition to the Tilta rig. Allows you to move the handles down and forward to, with the addition of a shoulder pad, create a shoulder rig for the BMCC. Amazon price was way better than eBay or direct from Tilta. 
11657 4 awesome!!! use it all the time!!!!! great price 
11658 4 Be careful with using them in flashlights they will blow bulbs in streamlight TL-2 and TL- 3 my mistake but great lights 
11659 4 Camera, case and extra battery are great. The other stuff is just clutter 
11660 4 Love all of the compartments and construction of this bag. My Cannon t3i fits perfect! 
11661 3 as described. 
11662 4 Works as well as expected. Better for trip to Greece to take Acropolis photos in crowds. Light-weight & packable for carry on luggage for airplane, no questions asked (I thought it might not pass because could be used as a weapon). 
11663 1 One side where the flash is inserted just broke. Made of cheap material. 
11664 4 Great camera for the price.... Excellent customer service from Digital1 
11665 4 Quite satisfied with it. Do wish it had a GPS. 
11666 2 The further zoom the more blurry. 
11667 3 Order it and got it pretty quick. The item is working just fine. Came about half charge on one and the other was full charged. Thanks 
11668 4 Great product 
11669 4 The spectacle of this tiny camera is big, when you consider its tiny size. I bought the camera for its large 20.1 sensor, but mainly because it boasted a premium Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar lens. The results are unmistakenly grand. 
11670 4 Worked very well for charging my camera battery! 
11671 4 tks 
11672 4 Works well with my A7. 
11673 4 Love 
11674 3 Roy martin help was so appreciated thank you foscam!!! 
11675 4 Great Product. How do you get value any batter than this with Prime shipping?! 
11676 2 Works pretty well. Sometimes difficult to keep it out of the picture. 
11677 1 The description item says &#34;Waterproof&#34; and I have used just one time in my pool and later, the screws show corrosion. 
11678 4 Complete package of accessories for lower than individual prices. 
11679 4 Easy setup, superior design, and superb definition. 
11680 0 Camera sucked in lighting setting weren t helpful. Pictures came out light. Better to buy in store. 
11681 4 Cable arrived ahead of schedule and worked as expected. Good service, good value. 
11682 4 super dooper 
11683 4 great 
11684 4 This works great, first tried a bar fly which was no good. Arkon actually fits the bars of a bicycle handle 
11685 4 It floats and it s easily visible. Solid product especially for the price. Saved me the first time I used it, almost lost my camera as i was floating down the Potomac river. 
11686 4 perfecto 
11687 4 like it..! 
11688 3 Good quality tape. 
11689 4 I really love this product. It s all about whatever I was looking for. It s so convenient. I am fully satisfied. 
11690 4 Works great, and shipping was quick! 
11691 4 They gave me the purchase price for what I paid for since they couldn t fix my camera and were very nice helpful and quick 
11692 4 soooo happy with my purchase! the shipping was super fast and came a day early. :) I am so excited to use it! 
11693 3 Exactly what we expected. 
11694 4 Both the battery and charger have worked well so far, and that too, at a price that is hard to beat! 
11695 4 Works great! 
11696 4 I love my Canary. Not only does it help me keep an eye on the house, but I can also watch the kids playing in the other room! 
11697 3 They work great, good investment! 
11698 3 The pictures are clear and pretty low maintenance for the price. The night view could be better, and the mounting brackets are cheap, they never stay in place and requires frequent adjustments. Anyway, over all a good buy for the price. 
11699 0 It broke the first day i got it the foot crumbled now can t be used. Didn t even get to try it out very disappointing 
11700 3 Great hidden camera, no one even can notice it s recording. Directions are confusing, but after you buy it, the seller sends clear instructions. Wish it was 1080p too. 
11701 3 Used for transporting firearm on vacation 
11702 4 Ordering more. 
11703 4 No problems, 
11704 0 Crappy accessories. 
11705 4 Love this camera....very easy to set up and use. The picture/video is clear even in low light. I like having the ability to keep an eye on what s going on at home when I m not there. The motion sensor and text alert are also great. 
11706 4 Love this so much!!! Beyond my expectations and it s worthy for me to wait so loong time to have it :) 
11707 4 ok 
11708 3 Have been using this camera both on dry land and underwater. I think the auto-focus is not quite as good as the old Canon that I replaced but, otherwise, this is a nice camera for someone who just wants to &#34;point and shoot.&#34; 
11709 4 Amazing Value for the money. Recommend buying extra batteries, there is a set of 4 or 5 that can be charged at the same time. That is what I bought and it is perfect. about 45 minutes total fly time. 
11710 3 Good idea for waterproof cameras, but no way to adjust for wrist/hand size. Well made 
11711 4 The caps is a great help when transporting water. 
11712 4 Thank you :) 
11713 4 Superb product for a great price. Lightweight and compact. 
11714 4 Not as good a picture as the Fujikam it replaced, but all of the local services it provides (to e-mail, local recording, FTP upload) make it worth it. The web interface is also well laid out and easy to use. Presets are pretty cool to play around with. 
11715 4 Love this thing! I bought this for my wife for Mother s Day and had no problem setting it up. It s completely easy to use. Really cool digital photo frame. 
11716 4 The best I have used 
11717 4 No complaints!! 
11718 0 The blower was the only item that completely matched the description. Biggest letdown was receiving a cheap brush pen instead of a Lens Pen. 
11719 4 Very happy with the camera system, I can rest better knowing I can watch the activity around the house at night, 
11720 4 Great clarity. Traveled abroad and monitored thr cameras with no problems. Make sure you have a good internet connection and you re golden. Customer support was very responsive to my questions before receiving and after. Highly recommended. 
11721 4 OK 
11722 4 awesome! 
11723 0 It didn t come with all of the pieces to cover all the sides. 
11724 4 Excellent work perfectly! 
11725 4 Shipped quickly, works perfect for the Nikon camera I am using for. 
11726 3 Does what it says 
11727 1 Didn t work for what I intended to use it for. Tried to mount my camera on my windshield but my camera would just be facing at awkward angles. Very strong suction though. 
11728 3 I would have given it 5 stars but you cannot view your photos with this on, otherwise it works as advertied 
11729 4 Better than expected 
11730 3 It s a good camera for what I need it for. The tripod is stupid... seriously, there s no other description for it. 
11731 4 It looks nice, and I like the pattern. 
11732 4 These are light and move very smoothly and with great ease. It was a great purchase. I bought a second one here at Amazon after this first one arrived. Make sure you have the right width based on your tripod. 
11733 4 Works perfect for my cameral!!! 
11734 1 Sometimes when one gets stuck it ruins the whole case and you can no longer use the rest of the packaged polaroid 
11735 4 Great price, works well. Worked like a OE flash. Will by another for a slave unit. 
11736 2 Not as thick as I expected. 
11737 0 This was cheaply made and tightening each leg as i lengthened it was a night mare. Didn t stay tight. The legs became loose and one of them broke. This was all within a month of getting it with minimal use. 
11738 4 [[VIDEOID:153357149d2c408819cc54ff2a1c437a]] Camera take great videos. Came with lots of accessories. Waterproof case works great. Great camera for the price.

11739 4 Great picture & Super wide image. Onvif works. Using 2 of them with BlueIris. 
11740 4 Second time buying this product.. no issues, works great for our chicken coops! 
11741 4 FAST DELIVERY...PERFECT FABRIC...LIGHTWEIGHT YET DOES HOLD ITS SHAPE VERY WELL.... 5 STARS TO THE COMPANY....COWBOY STUDIO 
11742 4 Just as expected 
11743 4 I have a Lopro that s a little bigger and takes up to much space. This smaller version fits the bill when I m packing lighter. Good value 
11744 4 Better than buying more filters. 
11745 4 same as before 
11746 4 all fine 
11747 4 Great case for the money. 
11748 4 The camera is very easy to use and is small enough to fit in your pocket or purse. Takes good pictures. 
11749 2 When this camera works, it s fantastic. I purchased it to take photos of the animals in our local animal shelter. The Sports mode and burst functions work very well for this application. The problem is that the camera is unreliable. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn t. 
11750 3 Have not had to use alarm, but like knowing that it is here if I do need it. I tested alarm, and it worked. 
11751 4 Good deal and very good lights. 
11752 4 the battery s and the charger work great. 
11753 3 Very easy to setup. The cameras have decent low light resolution but in color and with light sometimes are blurry. The motion detection is very sensitive, picking up even slight movements. Overall and for them money, this is a very good product. 
11754 3 It s awesome lots of pockets, and useful cutouts. It doesn t hold a P3 controller perfect, but I made do. 
11755 3 Good camera for the price! 
11756 4 Used this for snorkeling and scuba in south florida. Evens out the color just perfectly!! 
11757 4 I like 5x7 format for my photos.... the problem is there are no small photo albums. This one does nicely...... 
11758 4 they work good.Just what I needed. Was about to chunk the camera but they fixed it. 
11759 4 great conversion piece with fellow shooter. Works well and just not on camera and lens. 
11760 4 Excelente 
11761 4 Perfect!!!! Great batteries on arrived early!! 
11762 4 This is perfect for what I do. Needed for release on landscape pics that required long shutter speeds. 
11763 4 Perfect 
11764 4 The Removu P1 is a lifesaver when it comes to framing shots while boating. Until now, it was a guessing game to make sure I had the shot I wanted, but now I can make sure I get the shot I need without risking my phone to the water. 
11765 4 Absolutely the best purchase 
11766 2 Very good mount but the screws that come with it strip easily - do not use the screws that come with the product -only good for sheetrock if that 
11767 4 Nice little camera amazing performance for the price. 
11768 4 Love my ringlight 
11769 4 Nice gr8 price 
11770 4 Works as expected. We lost our Nikon version and this cheaper version works just like the Nikon version. 
11771 4 Love it 
11772 3 Pretty. 
11773 4 Works! 
11774 4 lasted about 2 hours of non stop photo taking before needing charged 
11775 2 I should have measured my camera s screen first ! 
11776 4 Good quality film, and it lasted me a long time. 
11777 4 I love it! 
11778 4 Best camera of my equipment, good quality and reliable. 
11779 4 Great product and great support! 
11780 3 Good product 
11781 2 was unable to attach the arm to the stand as it doesn t fit at all, not even the mid section... 
11782 4 Used primarily for night photography and eliminated camera jitter due to camera motion when triggering the shutter. 
11783 4 Just as described 
11784 4 Good Product 
11785 4 I though it would have been to small and not have any sections but to my surprise it was perfect. love the color and it feels & look like a regular messenger handbag 
11786 4 It s everything Canon and everyone else who has one says it is and more. 
11787 3 Great Value! 
11788 4 Good easy to use zoom lens 
11789 4 AS ADVERTISED 
11790 4 Henry was fantastic with his support, so far camera is ok. 
11791 4 This seems to be just what I needed. 
11792 2 I loaded 10 pictures onto a flash drive to plug into the USB. It will only display 4 of them. I have no idea why that would be. It s a basic frame so I can t seem to find much information on it. Very, very annoying. 
11793 1 Returned it after finding many of the screws on the clamps were stripped out. If you get a good one probably not bad for the price. 
11794 4 We use this camera float mudder often as we are Floridians and &#34;live&#34; in the water. Its somewhat of a bulky fit for my petite female wrist and little unattractive but it does the job well. 
11795 4 Super durable! 
11796 0 Poor quality product. Battery never charges, buttons work randomly and after 2 months of use the volume buttons stop functioning. 
11797 4 It s been a good feature for airsoft 
11798 4 Excellent value - Provide hours of recording time in the Canon M41 camera. 
11799 4 Love it, work great. 
11800 4 Loved all the gadgets and the suction cup actually works on the hood of the car - it didn t budge at all. Good quality and lots of variety for a great price. 
11801 4 Perfect for my camera. Plugs into the wall and so keep one battery in camera and if I go out, I tuck the spare in with the camera. 
11802 0 No customer support ? Who is responsible here Agasio ? Foscam ? The support number dials Foscam and they say call Agasio ? Ridiculous Do not buy Agasio 
11803 4 Works as expected. 
11804 4 I bought this for a wedding I was a second shooter at worked perfectly and I love it , the stars made it very easy to put on my flash when I needed it. It folds up very flat so doesn t take up much room in your bag. 
11805 2 I m not really sure if this works or doesn t work, or make a difference. But one thing I learned is to be careful how far I insert the cord tip into the conditioner. It can, and has, pulled out the cord tip, rendering the cord useless. 
11806 0 Charges battery but e charge on the camera runs out only after one hour of use! 
11807 4 Order arrived safely and quickly. 
11808 4 This camera is amazing! I have 3 other people interested in purchasing the same thing! 
11809 3 once adjusted to both eyes it works great, Good buy for the money 
11810 4 perfect 
11811 4 very good..... 
11812 3 Easy to use. Gives good light. A tiny bit too heavy for my flash--causing it to move the swivel. 
11813 4 Good price seems to be the same as the one with the Nikon logo but less cost. 
11814 4 awesome. no complaints 
11815 3 Works well, had for a while and still working well. Nights a little blurry but still good. I will try to put a photo or two on here of the night vision. In the next couple days.:-) 
11816 4 Polarizer arrived on time and was as advertised. Condition was very good and it works well with my 14-150mm telephoto lens. 
11817 4 like it a lot 
11818 0 They were not even close to what was advertised 
11819 4 Henry is good. 
11820 2 battery drains quickly but it works if used immediately. 
11821 4 This is one nifty little accessory. Many uses and very sturdy. I already had a ball head to use with it, if you don t, you might want to consider purchasing with the ball head. 
11822 3 The fit is acceptable, but a little loose. It comes off just a little too easily. 
11823 4 Exactly as described, works excellent! Bought as a gift specifically for the moon filter and they are greatly impressed with the quality and viewing capabilities that this kit offers as a suppliment to their Celestron telescope. 
11824 4 This lightweight camera has some great features and I think with be fabulous when travelling! 
11825 4 Great camera 
11826 4 it was great 
11827 1 Worked fine for 6 months, then started making corrupt files and ceasing recording at random intervals. Had to tell the cops that the hit and run I filmed was a corrupted file. No one was happy. 
11828 3 Love the Camera. Bit confused on some of the accessories that came with it.. some seem to be missing parts.... 
11829 4 Love...exactly what I needed 
11830 4 Bought this for my son-in-law, who had a camera bag, but it was big and bulky. He loves this as it is compact and he can take it with him hiking much easier. 
11831 3 I wish it had a wider panoramic view, other than that it is awesome! 
11832 4 Replacement for lost charger works 
11833 4 Always can use extra mounts 
11834 0 It is not good ,l will not recommend it to anyone, 
11835 4 No problem! 
11836 2 This case works well, but after swimming, the lens fogged up, ON THE INSIDE 
11837 4 Thanks you! Great job. Shipment did arrive late:( 
11838 4 This is the safest option for me to carry my cards. There is been a couple of instances where the cards are falling out of their places, but not enough for me to dock a star off of this review 
11839 4 Very Well Satisfied. Thanks. 
11840 1 I bought this to save a little money, and it broke the second day I had it. 
11841 4 Flies very well inside the house but is no good for outside 
11842 4 i use this to hang images at comic cons and it works great! sturdy and easy to set up. held up all 30 images. awesome purchase! 
11843 4 The pictures turned out great!! 
11844 3 Good quality but do not fit as well. 
11845 4 Very good, auto-focus works as long as there is enough light. I prefer to use it with a zoom lens since with a prime the distance object - lens is too critical. 
11846 3 Good addition to the Roam 3 bundle, exactly what it is....nothing more....nothing less... 
11847 3 Like the others, very nice, I have seen some ?? hoodlums walk be and sort of glanced around to find the other cameras, some fake many many real ones J R 
11848 3 Solid image quality. Interface not as good as GoPro, but otherwise can t find a flaw. Gopro accessories work well with it. Get a lot of interference when recording with auxiliary power source. 
11849 4 Excellent 
11850 4 great lens for close up work at school. 
11851 3 Worked for me......Takes a bit a skill to get a fine adjustment......course adjustment is quick and once locked with the thumb set screw very stable. So far only used with a 28 MM lens which is fairly light. 
11852 4 Protect your investment. 
11853 4 Works extremely well as a baby monitor with a phone app! 
11854 4 I liked the product 
11855 1 One of the connector that holds the strap to the bag broke within 6 months, the other one keep coming off from the bag. The bag is too deep to reach Not efficiently designed for its size Good thing that I got it free when I bought camera 
11856 4 Its answer to all my needs. 
11857 4 Nice work fine. 
11858 4 Perfect for my application, and I love the small footprint it has! 
11859 4 as described,easy to use 
11860 1 Doesn t work at night .... Not sure if I have something plugged in wrong. 
11861 4 Works perfectly, just what I needed 
11862 0 theses lenses are not meant for ipod touch 5th generation. it keeps falling off of my camera. 
11863 4 I was a bit apprehensive after reading a few of the reviews, but after a week s use in the field in hand-held flash mode for my macro photography, I have absolutely no complaints. 
11864 4 FAKE BUT THEY LOOK REAL! 
11865 4 This is a perfect bag for just about everything I do. Great for travel, casual movement between offices, trip with the family. From clothes to electronics and everything else. Great construction and already has taken quite the beating. The bag is holding up great. 
11866 2 OK ... it s supposedly a NIKON-made shutter release but the price (almost $40) is ridiculous ! It s well-made but NOT worth that much money. 
11867 4 Batteries last all day , recharge pretty quick. No Problems. Can never have to many batteries. 
11868 4 Excelente!!! 
11869 3 Fair enough 
11870 4 Product arrived on time and as advertised. Otherwise, what an I say? They re cleaning cloths. A good value for the money, and they do a good job, both for my glasses as well as (gently) cleaning camera lens filters. 
11871 4 Great for my two light stands with light socket attached. 
11872 4 everything was as stated in the product description and the quality is as expected and the price is good too 
11873 4 worked well, no issues or flaws found in product 
11874 2 Cool 
11875 4 Works great! Just like the ones that came with my other lenses. 
11876 4 Happy with my purchase 
11877 4 Its controls are way easier than others I bought my kids. 
11878 1 Very please with it 
11879 4 Perfect bundle! 
11880 1 Too small......got a bigger one 
11881 4 Great tool to have in your bag, doing a lot of GoPro filming like I do. It s nice to have a tool to be able to tighten it so tight it will not move. Using this when you have high impact stress helps to improve your video quality. 
11882 4 I couldn t be happier! I use this for monitoring the children when it s nap time. Super crisp images night or day. 
11883 4 Perfect for me... small,compact and easy to use. 
11884 0 Out of the eight pictures taken, only 4 developed. I have never seen instant camera film this bad. 
11885 4 Great zink paper 
11886 4 Very nice cameras! 
11887 4 Sharp images and vivid colours. 
11888 3 Does the job without extra wiring. 
11889 2 Knew it was vintage, actually looked used. Came with European wiring and plug. Had to replace plug, which took up the cost of the lamp. 
11890 4 The only bad thing, was 3 of them broke before the end of the roll of film. We ll see how the photos turned out in a few days. 
11891 3 I wouldn t recommended this for photography.. I use it for electronic pass thought for my canon s lens so I can control the aperture. The auto focus is to slow for any type of photography use 
11892 2 Good for the most part. Wish the case was better quality though, especially the inside padding 
11893 4 Exactly what I needed 
11894 4 seem to work well. I have had others that did not 
11895 3 for the money, not a bad buy. 
11896 4 This lens is crisp and clear! I am in no way a professional photographer, but love to photograph as a hobby. This was the perfect addition to my basic lens. 
11897 4 Works great. Adds stability to vertical shots. Adds weight with two batteries. 
11898 4 Well built. But it is tall if you have on a tripod and the slider. 
11899 1 Could see in lens. 
11900 4 Really good product stands up to what it says 
11901 4 Work very well on plastic lenses. Never have enough of these. As good as anything I have tried in the past. 
11902 4 Love the case and functionality of this item 
11903 4 Good strap easy to use, connects with other Op/Tech products, makes it easy to swap straps when needed. 
11904 3 I just got this so we have sometime to try it out, but I plan on coming back with and updated 30day review! For the price this is amazing! It came with so many extras and I m really excited to take it with us to the pool tomorrow 
11905 4 Works as advertised! Not much more to say than that! 
11906 4 LASTS LONGER THAN ORIGINAL BATT WOULD BUY AGAIN!! 
11907 4 Amazing quality. Just wish I had opted for the slightly higher model that had wifi, so I could connect to my smartphone. 
11908 4 Great zoom 
11909 4 nothing is more trusting than foggy camera lenses. These have helped, haven t had any issues since using them. 
11910 2 Can t use auto focus but these little lens adapters are pretty neat 
11911 3 After testing all the accesories in different scenarios I can say that this bundle is very good, specially for the price. Only negative point is the weekness of selfie stick 
11912 3 Stands seem a bit top heavy! 
11913 3 Working Great 
11914 4 amazing camera wrist strap. bought it for my nikon d3300 and it worked perfectly 
11915 4 Love it! 
11916 4 Great product. Delivery was fast and the covers fit my Gopro perfectly. 
11917 1 I found it in parrot story US by22.99$ 
11918 3 Must use on flat surface 
11919 4 Absolute must have when buying the ski phantom 2 drone 
11920 4 Awesome case! 
11921 4 The Promaster adds an extra layer of protection to your lens. As a bonus, it does not distort your pictures. 
11922 4 very good 
11923 4 Simple device that works well for various photo ops. 
11924 4 It worked great and we loved the wrist strap 
11925 3 Works great 
11926 4 worked well 
11927 3 hi l hace neewer nw565ex is there any setting to remove the beep every time i take a photo 
11928 4 Received in timely manner and was as advertised 
11929 3 I like it 
11930 3 It shipped quickly, the product works perfectly for land or water. I am very satisfied with this model. 
11931 4 Excellent kit, batteries last longer than gopro batteries. 
11932 4 Remarkable camera. Amazing feature set and great IQ. Feels good in the hand. 
11933 4 Does just what i thought it could do. Perfect! 
11934 0 Unit worked once then quit working. New egg and manufacturer FAILED TO refund or replace defective product after many requests. New egg passed responsibility to CHINA company who has not refunded for product. RIP OFFS 
11935 4 As advertised. great light and can t beat the price. Works greats off camera with my two other Canon Speedlites. .they all get along like one big happy family!! 
11936 3 Just what i needed. 
11937 4 Work fine and was what we were looking for 
11938 3 Glad to have another battery 
11939 4 Very good product 
11940 3 Great camera! Great video quality! This being said: The default IP differs from the documentation; the bundled software also kinda sucks... I recommend the Blue Iris software instead. 
11941 4 I love this selfie stick! Wonderful quality! I had before stick from be bath and beyond and the quality sucked! This stick is amazing: easy to manipulate, holds phone well and has a nice color! Love it! I always have it with me ;) 
11942 0 The video not clear. The sound is bad and nosy. The detect move notification is late. It is really useless 
11943 4 Bought several of these cases. They work great and are a bargain. 
11944 4 Awesome value. Simple setup. Well done. 
11945 3 nice and compact but sturdy 
11946 3 was looking for an underwater stick to use for scuba/snorkeling.. this worked awesome 
11947 4 I love my filters! They improve my photos so much! 
11948 4 So far so good. I almost went with a SLR but prefer a pocket-sized because of so many activities with my kids. 
11949 4 Excellent, watches over the contents of my garage 
11950 0 I m so unhappy , the mobile holder was broken as you can see in the photo 
11951 4 Just as described. 8 year old loves it. There is a learning curve to flying but he has mastered it. There were a few crashes in the beginning but the copter held up fine. 
11952 3 Haven t put a 5 star yet because I m not 100% finished hooking up everything at the dvr, but so far everything is great!! Quality material and everything works. Can t beat the price either 
11953 3 great value except battery charger charges the batteries slow 
11954 4 I was worried about sacrificing quality to get such a...portable lens. I didn t have to worry. 
11955 4 Great Item. 
11956 4 Hands down the fastest I ve ever received any product. Great quality! Recommend to use this seller. 
11957 4 Excellent 
11958 4 Product packaging solid, fully applicable to outdoor sports, good quality, practical，I have used the suction cup and it did a fantastic job,and will use other accessories for a free time 
11959 4 Not bad 
11960 1 The on/off switch does not work with my Canon HF G-20 camera. Does the endless cycle (on/off) as has been reported on other cameras in review section. Zoom does work 
11961 4 Good quality bag. I use it for my Fuji X100S, which fits just barely. I wish Billingham made a bigger version, as well. I would love to use this as a camera sleeve for my Leica M. 
11962 4 Great exposure and very easy for me to use! 
11963 4 easy to use, just love it - this was a replacement as I lost the first one 
11964 4 Stick and move... This is better than a bare flash gun will ever be. Nice soft focused light. Cats wait for no man. 
11965 0 Terrible it didn t work at all, it didn t show any recording only lines across. Don t by it just try a different one. 
11966 4 So far, so good.. 
11967 4 I ve used this type of Nikon flash for years now. Very reliable, durable, great quality, always great performance. I like its light and compact size. 
11968 2 Wasn t quite as heavy duty as I thought it would be but it worked for the low price. 
11969 4 Am old school and like 35mm. This does a great job for what I need. 
11970 4 Great performance 
11971 4 I love the ability for family to send photos via email. 
11972 0 Unable to use the suction cup, I think it requires a housing for the gopro camera that snaps onto the suction cup and the same goes for the chest strap. 
11973 3 Great product and deal. I bought this for my son, who likes to make movies and he absolutely loves it. The stand is just a tabletop model, I thought it would be bigger, but it folds down, so my son leaves it on all the time. 
11974 4 So far, so good! Holds a big charge. 
11975 2 I am not really sure if it did cleaning job. I have not noticed any difference either in playing a tape or recording. 
11976 3 Battery type and no recharge when connected to computer. All other features are good. 
11977 3 A compact camera bag with comforted anti-theft features, nicely done! 
11978 4 Works great! 
11979 0 Worked ok but very disappointed that it did not come with the device. 
11980 4 Exactly what I was looking for 
11981 4 Nice deal and fast delivery 
11982 4 Great item. Quick shipping! 
11983 4 Works. I have not tried a battery drain but what I see so far looks great. 
11984 4 Does not seem to last as long as the Canon battery that came with my camera. But for the price I am satisfied. 
11985 4 Works great. Plenty of peices so you can get the camera at any angle you d like. 
11986 3 It works and charges 2 at once, but it feels cheap and the electronic display of the charge is wrong. 
11987 2 Lack of instructions with the piece means you need to do a little research, but works as expected. 
11988 4 Love it. I may look like a dork, but its easier to take selfies. Had to work a bit to download software, but stick works great. 
11989 4 Great product at a great value!!! 
11990 4 Perfect replacement if you lose your original lens caps and covers. 
11991 0 this does not work for a Canon 5d mark iii, they say it does but it doesnt. Will return. 
11992 4 Very useful. 
11993 4 Very nice in quality ! Happy with my purchase, also came a day early! 
11994 4 great bag for city shooting. Walked around downtown many times with this bag. 
11995 3 good 
11996 4 I m in love with this lens!!! I love not having to change lenses all the time!! Defiantly worth every penny!! And all the extras!!! Wow I was amazed!! 
11997 4 [[VIDEOID:69cd76e77c27154e03a263510f0419fe]] Camera take great videos. Came with lots of accessories. Waterproof case works great. Great camera for the price.

11998 4 It fits! 
11999 4 Nice small camera bag, a little too fat once you put and extra battery in it, but it will work 
12000 3 i m glad i purchased the hand trap, however, i haven t used it yet but the cost was great. i ve seen lots of professional photographers using their hand strap so i m sure when i use mind I will be glad i purchased it. 
12001 4 Excellent !! 
12002 0 Did not work right out. The box I was hard to pair the controller to the unit and it did not hover it was all or nothing on speed And after about 60 min. Of run time all the unit wanted to do was flip. 
12003 4 I like it alot for the price. when panning or tilting it does not move very smooth but that is to be expected with a tripod in this price range. 
12004 4 Good looking product. Not to sturdy tho, it will fall apart soon..but for the time being, it will suffice. 
12005 4 It s a must 
12006 4 Only buy your batteries OEM. Period. 
12007 4 Fast delivery and great product 
12008 3 best 
12009 2 Great product. Wish the seller could give some different recommendations on how it could be used. I searched YouTube for all kinds of ways you can use the straps. I was able to put it on my ski boot while snow skiing. It was awesome shots! 
12010 4 Very good 
12011 4 The package really saved a lot of money for us. This has all the functioning accessories for a semi-professional photographer. 
12012 4 very nice portable instruction booklet that be placed into camera bag 
12013 4 Nice camera cover 
12014 4 it s great 
12015 0 how do I return it Can t get it to work most of the time on my Samsung Galaxy S 4 I phone. 
12016 0 too lightweight...not good at all 
12017 4 Worked as expected 
12018 4 for the price, they are exactly why we need. they aren t SUPER durable, but thats not what we are looking for. people knock over our flash stands ALL the time, so its nice to have something thats faithful and replaceable if broken. 
12019 3 Simple but it s nicely made and it works 
12020 4 Excellent 
12021 3 so far so good bought less expensive model a year ago and screen looked schattered with colors and was disappointed after my first one lasted so long without problems 
12022 4 My daughter loves her camera, and this film worked out well for us. 
12023 4 Love this product! 
12024 4 Very good price More importantly, the product works as advertised. I replaced the deteriorating mounts with the new mounts which immediately connected to the system through the wiring. Thus far, the product is operation properly. 
12025 4 Just what I needed 
12026 4 as advirtised 
12027 4 good product 
12028 4 Worked just as good if not better than the original I am on my fourth photo shoot and have 38% still active I definitely recommend these batteries 
12029 4 I swap out the batteries all the time, they charge quick and I always have a good battery to go to 
12030 4 Excellent GoPro pole. Light and medium sized. 
12031 4 NICE ITEM 
12032 4 It s good for its price 
12033 3 Works good. Camera quality is not the best but does a job. Easy to install. 
12034 4 This item worked nicely 
12035 0 I try this for my iPhone 6 Plus. The thing is top heavy and keep ripping over not matter how I adjust this thing. 
12036 4 cheap yet very good quality head mount for GoPro camera 
12037 4 Easy to set up and sync. Tried it with both mine and my husband s phones (Samsung S5 & S6) and worked great. Can t wait to take it on vacation. Extends easily and the product has a tight hold on my phone. Love the color as well :) 
12038 4 Great product. Highly recommend. 
12039 4 Good simple case that fits my Panasonic DMC-FZ70 perfectly. I keep battery and charger in front pocket and SD cards in flap pocket. I like it. 
12040 4 Very nice came one time 
12041 3 very good 
12042 3 Great bang for your buck 
12043 3 So far works and my VHS camera hasn t fallen off. 
12044 4 Great product and price! Fit on my Nikon lens without any problem. You won t be disappointed in buying this one. 
12045 2 The lenses are awesome, but the way they attach to the phone is really annoying and can crack your screen if you re not careful. Good lenses though. 
12046 4 The selfie stick looks very cute. The button is sensitive. The selfie stick is convenient to take picture. Like it very much. 
12047 4 Use these in my RV for a bit of security. Stay put and do the job. Great seller! 
12048 4 Used this on the three week trip to Alaska, knowing the my regular strap would kill my neck. Love this!!! 
12049 4 Love this lens. It was priced right and is excellent quality. I would recommend it to anyone that loves prime lenses. 
12050 4 Great product. Light and easy to carry. Heavy duty endurance! 
12051 4 The &#34;handle bar&#34; piece fits my roll cage in my car 
12052 0 Cheap product, memory card inserted all the way into the camera instead of clicking into place. You can t record on a card that is floating around inside the camera. 
12053 3 Good mounts and good price 
12054 4 You get a really cool perspective on your snokeling with this mask, relive the moments of feeding fish all around you! 
12055 4 I love this! I put it in a tote bag when I don t need my whole camera bag and gear and just look like anyone else on the street. 
12056 4 FAST, AS PROMISED 
12057 3 Good one I am using it for pat 2 years. 
12058 3 One side of my Big lights don t work. Other than that the product is a great buy. 
12059 4 Since the camera didn t come with it, I had to get this product, which complements it perfectly and the neoprene is comfortable. 
12060 4 This polarizing filter works extremely well for the price. I can detect no noticeable distortion in images in which it has been used. 
12061 4 Nice set of filters in a nice holder. The Polarizing filter works well with the UV used to protect the lens. 
12062 4 Fantastic ,works great and excellent service 
12063 4 Unbelievably efficient. 
12064 3 I d give it 5 stars if it were metal, otherwise it is very real. Photo sensor shuts it off during daylight to save batteries. The IR LEDs for night vision are just like the real thing. Very real looking if you are 10+ft away. 
12065 4 Got this for my mom. It is so easy to set up. We already loaded hundreds of photos and it has great quality. I thought this might be too big but it s perfect. Best gift ever. And the best part is that it will constantly be updated for her! 
12066 3 The zoom feature is nice, however the picture quality is not much better than my 800 TV lines of resolution from my Zosi camera at one third the price. Rain tends to stick to the lens and distort the image. 
12067 4 Worked as expected 
12068 4 These are replacement batteries for my new Leica Q. Rather than paying over $100 for Leica s battery, this Wasabi package includes two batteries, life same as Leica, and includes a great dual-volt charger. 
12069 3 very good tripod for photo and video. i recomand 
12070 4 Thx 
12071 4 Works perfect. Fast shipping. 
12072 3 So far, a good solid camera that takes good pictures. My daughter took it to Europe, and the pictures turned out pretty good. 
12073 3 This works alright. With snappier rounds, it can get a little loose. I haven t had a problem with my .22 or 9mm. We put it on my friends .40 and it tended to fly around a little. 
12074 4 Easy to set up and works great. 
12075 4 A+ 
12076 4 GREAT battery 
12077 4 Great lens 
12078 4 Great price fast shipping it works great 
12079 4 Purchased for the PowerShot SX700. Battery life appears equivalent or better than Canon battery that came with camera. Takes recharging well. Good to have reliable spare batteries for several hours of continuous camera use, with and without flash. 
12080 4 No need for an expensive one, this is all you need. Unless you like wasting extra money for no reason. 
12081 4 great product well worth the money... 
12082 4 Can t really ask for more so far so good awesome product 
12083 4 Excelent add-on to the GoPro, and nice bang for your buck. 
12084 4 Great little camera, easy to use. 
12085 4 Its camera was really awesome i can even connect it with mywifi router also using its WPS button.all over i would like to 
12086 4 This is my first hefty photography purchase, I m a beginner and I would absolutely recommend this. It s been great so far. 
12087 4 Used it on vacation and got excellent photos. 
12088 0 I have to revise my initial review. This product mostly worked as advertised for about a month, maybe less then suddenly stopped working. I emailed the seller for guidance with no luck. Be Wary 
12089 0 Do not buy! Flies away on its own! Totally lost all my money and gopro4 
12090 4 Arrived earlier than I expected. I didn t like the packaging, but I like the bag very much--that matters. Fits my Canon SLR with a battery grip and an 18-135mm lens. There s still a room for one more lens but I don t wanna overload it. 
12091 4 I was pleasantly surprised at how well this portable vocal booth helped to isolate noise and give me clean vocals! I m very satisfied with it! 
12092 4 It works just as well as any lens cloth I ve used. Even though the top doesn t have a closure to keep the cloth in place I haven t had any problems with it falling out because it s a tight enough fit. 
12093 4 I love it! 
12094 2 for me, the price is equivalent with its quality. it is ok to shoot not quickly moving subjects. for better shoot, you need .... a tripod. a very very good tripod 
12095 4 Awesome!! 
12096 4 Works exactly as advertised. Has pockets and a drink bottle holder.. Makes it easy to hike around with the inspire 
12097 4 Just what I needed to replace my lost charger 
12098 4 well built tripod and I love it 
12099 4 very good product! 
12100 3 Solid buy for a much cheaper price than the canon version. I haven t used the canon version, so I can t necessarily compare the difference of the two. 
12101 3 The lights are great and illuminate my studio set for video and photo as expected. I would ve rated it a 5 star if it came with a carry bag. 
12102 4 I love this Will be using it on a trip in a few days But I have gotten some great selfie with this with my pets. 
12103 4 Received this product at a discount in exchange for an unbiased review This tripod is awesome!! We ve been using it with our kindle to watch movies! The legs are very flexible and we are able to make a stand that stands on our couch!! We love it!! 
12104 4 All perfect! 
12105 4 Does what it needs to do. 
12106 4 SO AMAZING. So cute and cheap& the texture of the front and back is bubbly. It is so amazing and holds the polaroids great!! 
12107 4 Its awesome cut my recharge time in half which allows me time for shooting pictures thank you 
12108 4 The item looks very good. Also, the seller is very responsive and supportive. 
12109 4 exactly what I needed. 
12110 3 well worth price for on the go Videos.. I use if for my Golf outings... nice !! 
12111 4 Superb glass quality achromatic lens, made in Japan. A rare find as new. Works great on my Sigma DP2 Merrill. 
12112 4 Got this as a gift, it came quick and was exactly what they wanted. 
12113 4 works great and super portable! 
12114 4 Great little tripod base. Legs are long which give solid support to the attached top heavy cell phone. 
12115 4 Perfect fit. Fast shipping. Thank you! 
12116 4 Yeah, I used this to store my anker charger and 2 extra batteries. I don t want to damage my battery so yeah. This thing keeps it getting crushed inside my backpack. 
12117 4 Purchased this for my GoPro Hero+LCD and it works great. It fits everything all my accessories and extra mounts I have with plenty of room. 
12118 0 Very delicate, instructions not very helpful. Broke second time using it. 
12119 4 Battery was an exact fit! Camera working great 
12120 4 Works like the original. 
12121 2 I used this to mount a Baby Monitor near my baby s crib. It is just okay. It doesn t grip that well and caused it to slide down all the time. I also bought another one with a better grip (cushion instead of plastic) and it s WAY better. 
12122 4 Exactly what I needed! 
12123 4 Fantastic Umbrella 
12124 4 Great product and shipped fast. 
12125 0 One star. 
12126 2 Feels cheap 
12127 4 THIS SD STORAGE CASE IS GREAT! 
12128 4 the perfect starter cleaning kit for a camera 
12129 3 A OK!! 
12130 4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTC3eUorRMU Here is how I used it I think it worked great for us 
12131 3 [[ASIN:B00LAVA2OW EEEKit 8-in-1 Accessories Kit for Gopro HERO 4 Session LCD Black/Silver HD 3+/3/2/1 Camera]] It all came as advertised, and I am impressed with the assortment of accesories. I have not fitted the camera to these accessories yet, but it looks like it should all work. I m happy. 
12132 4 Great product and works as expected. 
12133 4 Absolutely amazing camera. More than I need. 
12134 3 you get what you paid for. items are not super premium but ok as they re not expensive, the straps for head and chest are totally worth it. 
12135 3 They do the job but if I would had known exactly what I was looking for I would have went with a better brand 
12136 3 This product is fine. It didn t get five stars due to the fact the band that holds the filters in place doesn t work to well. 
12137 4 I have two cameras now. Great picture, and lets me keep an eye on my dog while I m gone to work. 
12138 4 Very good generic cable for my cam 
12139 4 Thick, Soft! Will last forever. Beautiful flower design as you see it, orange/red, yellow, green with gold vase! :) 
12140 4 I upgraded a few months ago from the Canon t3i and I LOVE this camera! My quality of images has improved immensely, and it wasn t hard to learn how to use it. I would definitely recommend this camera! 
12141 4 its ok 
12142 4 smaller than I thought but work well - good price and quick delivery 
12143 4 Perfect! 
12144 0 my order arrived dirty 
12145 4 this backpack holds my dji phantom 2 vison plus v3 and all the equipment needed to fly except my ipad tri pod i have to carry it seperately and i still have one free hand.I don t know if it is the best backpack but it works perfectly for me. 
12146 4 They work 
12147 0 Firmware wrong! Don t buy 
12148 4 Awesome! Charges quickly and very easy to use. It is a must for Gopro users. 
12149 3 really good film. although taking pictures outside normally makes the picture over exposed. the film lasts for a long time and is just great over all. 
12150 2 Great quality images but super awkward to hold. I think that s ultimately why this body was discontinued. 
12151 4 This is such a good buy! It protects my camera from scratches and I get so much compliment on the case. 
12152 4 This has helped me so much! 
12153 3 Digital Goja was great, everything came as advertised. All the items were working properly. My only concern is that the Sigma Lens itself takes soft pictures, in general. I think it still is a good walk-around lens but I wish it could take sharper images. 
12154 3 I have both this camera and a Go Pro brand. I found this one to be much easier to use, lighter weight without feeling cheap and much less expensive! 
12155 4 Love this camera. Easy to use, takes great pictures. And takes AA batteries. 
12156 3 good price/value 
12157 4 Love my flip camera. I use in my classroom. 
12158 4 works as expected 
12159 4 Good quality mic with a very accessible price 
12160 4 Best Goods. I love it.!!! 
12161 4 Perfection 
12162 4 This is nice speedlite works like a charm. 
12163 3 Camera works fine 
12164 4 Good inexpensive lightweight portable tripod. Not to flimsy, good fit for small lightweight cameras. Nice to come with a carry case also. 
12165 4 I really like this viewfinder that enables you to take reflective readings, and it is easy to install and remove with the Sekonic light meter. Using the light meter with this has really helped my pictures. So far have just used it for landscape pictures. 
12166 4 Fullfill my expectations... 
12167 4 these are good cameras for the money 
12168 4 Works Great 
12169 3 I like the filter set but the filter holder could be a little stronger :):) otherwise the filters work well 
12170 4 It fits. Not loosening up 
12171 0 One battery can t last for 20 shots, though the other is fine. 
12172 3 It met my expectations. For the price, it s worth it. The resolution is somewhat limited. 
12173 3 I absolutely love these for the price! I bought one a year ago and just bought the 2nd. 
12174 4 Took it on mission trip to Guatemala. Gave more than 400 kids the first picture that they had ever had of themselves. Took picture of 88year old lady. When I gave it to her, she said it was first time she had a picture. 
12175 0 My stabilizer broke 1 DAY INTO SHOOTING! this is absolutely ridiculous & I would love to hear an explanation! 
12176 4 Some photographs are priceless...you ll ensure capturing the shot with a back up battery!!! This one will be used with my TG4 Olympus. 
12177 3 It works great with my Sony Nex 6. 
12178 4 Very good bridge camera. Options and online help have been very good. This kit from Amazon was all it promised, although I upgraded to faster/bigger memory right away. Very good photos, but best in class video. 
12179 4 Excellent product. 
12180 4 I got exactly what I needed for the price 
12181 4 They work well, and at a great price. 
12182 4 The batteries are great, the charger works, and it was a fraction of the price of the OEM version. 
12183 0 Had to replace..it did failed after several charges! 
12184 0 its not working...... 
12185 4 As described. Thanks 
12186 2 doesn t hold much 
12187 4 Showed up fast, works great. It replaced a DJI Vision 2+. 
12188 4 Perfect lens! 
12189 3 Great so far!, 
12190 0 Bad product that doesnt work at all 
12191 4 Great camera for the price. 
12192 0 Looks nothing like the picture on the box.Just clear through cheap plastic. Cant get the film roller to turn.Acts like it is locked into position. Then what could you expect for 10.00? Hopefully I can return it. 
12193 4 No complaints. 
12194 4 Great item, holds good charge, fits camera perfect. 
12195 4 Excellent product and seller. 
12196 4 Nice small simple camera. Does everything that I need a camera to do. 
12197 4 I needed a polarizer and lens hood for my zoom lens. This worked just fine. I like the cleaning brush. 
12198 4 Great for what it is 
12199 4 Great value, looking forward to purchasing other sizes for other lenses. 
12200 4 Great product, great price, no issues with it being refurbished. 
12201 4 battery works great. used with large Tamron 150-600mm lens and never wore out battery for a full day of wildlife shooting. 
12202 4 Plastic but feels good quality. Good for the money. Good as an entry level flash. 
12203 3 I might like it more if the product would have instructions on how to use it.. having great difficulty collimating my celestron reflecting telescope. 
12204 3 Love the color and touch screen and ease of use.... But it SUCKS UP YOUR BATTERY FAST. 
12205 2 Not quite what I expected 
12206 4 Excellent product with a comfortable grip and takes very good photos. 
12207 2 ok 
12208 4 Bought this for my son so he can use some legacy Canon FD lenses on his Canon digital camera. It works fine, and is well made. No problems focusing throughout the entire range. This is a good product. Recommended. 
12209 4 Great Picture ! 
12210 4 Delivered as advertised 
12211 4 Compact and useful. Wish I had had one of these years ago. 
12212 3 very useful but no adjustment of light 
12213 0 Total junk. Needle was stuck from time took it out and would never move. 
12214 4 Returned bought a different dropcam 
12215 4 Quality product, and one of the few I have seen that allow you to insert 4x6 pictures both horizontally and vertically, thereby allowing you to view vertical pictures without having to twist and turn the book around constantly. 
12216 4 Thanks 
12217 4 Product arrived on time and was as described. Perfect condition. Thank you ;-) 
12218 4 High quality. Thick cable. Rugged. 
12219 3 Small but perfect for this camera. 
12220 4 This battery was perfect. I have a battery that came with my Canon EOS Rebel T5, but sometimes forgot to recharge. So I decided that backup battery would be best. No complaints at all. It charges well and fit perfectly inside of my camera. 
12221 4 Just came off of vacation, worked great. 
12222 2 Dont buy this unless you have a warehouse size studio. Too many pieces to assemble. I wish I had saved my money because I never use it. In fact, I ve never used it. 
12223 3 Very good!! 
12224 4 Thank you 
12225 4 Great product, great customer service! 
12226 3 as back up batteries PERFECT Work with camera charge time a little short 
12227 4 Perfect for the backpack 
12228 1 Very short range! Went back to my 5yr old bunker hill(works most of the time). 
12229 4 I have given this a 5 star rating because of the vast selection of attachments, the price and the speed at which it was delivered. Each item is sturdy and well built. Most impressed. 
12230 3 Excellent a must have for a Sony camera 
12231 4 Kenneth done the best cx service very helpful.so happy.nice camera 
12232 4 Great choice! great service from company! 
12233 3 My son loves it and uses it in our pool a lot. 
12234 4 works well 
12235 0 I hate it. Not comfortable. Still slips down when you lift the camera up to take a picture. Tried it for a long time, now looking for something better. 
12236 4 great working, looks fine. 
12237 0 These cameras have very poor color rendition. 
12238 3 Good lens for shooting moon. 
12239 4 I loved it! Thank u ! 
12240 4 Photos came out fantastic!! I have an older Polaroid that I found at an estate sale and I was very hesitant about with to get for it. This site helped me a lot! Although it came out a little more yellow it had more to do with the Polaroid. 
12241 4 I love this. It s wonderfully sturdy with a great grip, and yet compact enough to carry in the tripod straps of your camera bag. Easy release attachment at the top is an extra plus. Well worth the price. 
12242 4 Works as advertised 
12243 4 Perfect fit case. 
12244 3 Very nice camera 
12245 3 Everything works and does the job. Light weight and easy to carry, like to a waterfall. Not made for rough handeling and I would not recommend use by children as the legs could be bent. 
12246 3 Didn t use right away. By the time we started using it, found out that there was a glitch in the remote and had to spend an additional $50 for download cable and update, just so we could use the remote control 
12247 3 A little bit tight for my WB350F but still a decent case. 
12248 4 great product. Works as described 
12249 4 Picked this up for my light painting brushes, seams well made, and is just the right size for all my flashlights and attachments. 
12250 4 Nice eyepieces.I have purchased several of these--the 31mm,19mm,10mm and 7mm all work as advertised 
12251 0 The 3 second delay between detected motion and picture taken along with poor focus gave no useful pictures. 
12252 2 It doesn t come with the memory card as of Aug 2015. 
12253 0 This did not work. It did not pick up dust from the sensor of my digital camera. 
12254 4 Perfect size and nicely padded. 
12255 4 My granddaughter loves this, 
12256 3 Know that this product comes from China and may take time to arrive. Product works nice in that it covers both the eye piece as well as the LCD screen. Only downside is that it easily rocks back and forth (left and right) fairly easily. 
12257 4 Exactly what it said it was. Fits my Canon 18-135mm EF-S perfectly. 
12258 4 Looks real! Especially for the price! 
12259 4 This battery pack was the perfect replacement. The price was was fair as well. Highly recommend. 
12260 3 It took weeks to get here from China. Phantom 3 fits in there great. You have to remove the tablet holder from the remote and no place for tablet inside. Not super rugged, but is much better than a floppy, soft-sided bag. Couldn t beat the price! 
12261 0 not work with my printer!!!(Polaroid Zip Instant Mobile Printer) 
12262 4 Nice little camera case. 
12263 4 worked well while scuba diving no wories about camera floating off 
12264 4 great for a beginner like me. 
12265 0 DOES NOT WORK WITH THE NIKON D3200. 
12266 4 I love this product so much.... I have searched all over for something that was suitable for my camera and I finally found it. The price is perfect, the quality is very good and the slider is perfect and ready to go whenever you need it. I highly recommend it! 
12267 4 Easy setup, better video quality than the garbage cameras I used to install in Wal-Marts and the remote monitoring, motion detection, sound, wireless capabilities are all a plus. A consumer friendly product with commercial grade (or better) uses. 
12268 4 Works great with Nikon 18-140mm NIKKOR (67mm). See attached photo made with +4 close up. 
12269 4 came quickly, works well. 
12270 4 It makes people look younger!!!! Great one!!!! 
12271 4 Perfect for small camera. 
12272 4 The microscope works well but the package was received without the CD and the free CD memory. RL 
12273 4 Took it to 80 feet, no problem. 
12274 0 It is literally useless it gets the picture in negative color them drops to static and its only 30 feet away. Waste of money very cheso and a waste. 
12275 4 Like it very much 
12276 4 Great set for new photographer. 
12277 4 Great little optic - very handy for hunts on the move! 
12278 4 Works perfectly for my gopro hero3, battery pack, and lcd screen. No issues charging. 
12279 4 Handy and useful! 
12280 2 The strap is comfortable but not without problems. Most importantly, the metal buckle reaches around to the fragile camera LCD screen so it can potentially damage it. 
12281 0 Never held a charge. Useless. 
12282 0 Doesn t work from the pc. I can only use it with my iPad. Very buggy and not worth the purchase. 
12283 4 Product as expected. 
12284 4 love this product. 
12285 4 Works great for trouble shooting. 
12286 4 Love the variety in the patterns/designs. Perfect for my 13 yr old and her cousin 
12287 0 I would love to be able to rate this product, however it came with no instructions... I would probably give it more stars if I could use it. 
12288 4 Excellent Quality 
12289 0 Junk! 
12290 4 I matched this with a Opteka MP100 monopod for a trip to Africa, as a full tripod would be too bulky to carry and use on Safari. 
12291 4 Perfect! 
12292 4 Wonderful quality. Not lightweight but carries well with its shoulder strap. I didn’t think I could afford binoculars this nice. 
12293 4 These were a great cost effective replacement for our stock cannon batteries. worked great. 
12294 2 I was hoping it would be a bit smaller, but its super loud and great otherwise. Definitely makes me feel safer. 
12295 4 This charger does the trick. I plug in 5 batteries and an hour or so later they are all charged and ready to go. That gives me a good 45 minutes of flying time to include changing them out. Much better than the one-battery charger that comes with the quadcopter. 
12296 3 lot of camera for the dollar 
12297 0 It stated it fit my camera but it didn t. Otherwise the quality was good 
12298 4 As good or better than the original batteries! 
12299 4 This is beautiful, looks amazing, Exceeded expectation for appearance. Don t know yet about how it holds up. 
12300 4 Light but strong lens cap keeper without any exposed metal scratchy parts. 
12301 4 it works great 
12302 4 So happy 
12303 3 GREAT EQUIPMENT at a GREAT PRICE!!! 
12304 4 Great product....the quality of the video really good too. My son really enjoys it. It is great family fun for all of us. 
12305 4 What a deal! These work just fine and the price is right. 
12306 4 Simply awesome 
12307 3 I m hoping these batteries will last longer than the last ones I purchased. 
12308 0 Did not work. 
12309 4 Great! Live the product...records great...just had to get extra device for cell phone viewing! But very happy overall thanks 
12310 4 This is an amazing camera. Super easy to set up. Great app. I can check on my home anytime. I can move the camera by swiping the screen. I am ordering additional cameras for other areas of my home. Great camera, great price! 
12311 4 After ordering and receiving the camera lens I found that it didn t fit, I contacted the reseller they sent an adapter ring, it works fine now. I am very happy with this reseller they went out there way make thing right. 
12312 0 Ordered 2 and both did not work. 
12313 0 Batteries don t fully charge or hold a charge for very long. Total waste of money. Don t buy. 
12314 4 Good!! 
12315 4 Very Good 
12316 4 I got this lens for wild life photography. It is heavy, but well worth the trouble. I ve gotten great shots across a lake, without any loss of image quality. This lens is Sigma s better quality, better sealing, better glass. I think it s great!! 
12317 4 Love it. Fast delivery 
12318 2 Not sharp at all. I use this for skateboarding 
12319 4 Worked perfect. Unfortunately the item I got it for was a piece of crap. But I ll hang onto this, never know if I ll need it. Sucks, cause now I don t actually need it. Grrr! oh well.... 
12320 4 I use this everyday and it produces some excellent pics plus other photographers are always interested in my camera. 
12321 4 Sharp. I use this lens all of the time. 
12322 0 Does not work with my camera as advertised..Total rip off. So disappointed. Might stop shopping on Amazon. Sellers require no creditabilty. 
12323 2 I would not describe as pro-grade but probably comparable to other tripods for the price. 
12324 4 Worked Flawlessly. 
12325 3 Great warning system that is inexpensive yet gets the job done. 
12326 2 Works as described although as many people have said and I can attest to it that the IR extender receiver doesn t work. 
12327 4 Spectacular lens. Extremely sharp on the Pentax 645Z, great contrast, and small footprint. Great grip. Little to no flare, even shooting directly into the sun. Only minor quibble is that there is some purple fringing against bright light. Fantastic value. 
12328 3 Recommended by fro knows photo, yeah its OK, pretty simple, limited use since there is no zoom. 
12329 1 This did not meet my expectation at all. I returned it to the vendor. 
12330 3 Solid product and a good cost benefit. Great for everyday shooting. Good materials and well made. 
12331 4 Makes you feel like a pro! Love all sides and works great for making pics better lighting 
12332 4 This was far better quality than I expected for $10. 
12333 3 works just like the originals 
12334 0 Didn t charge anymore after the first power up 
12335 0 Nikon does not recommend. Suggested using them could possibly void warranty. Returned for refund. 
12336 4 Loved it I take it wherever I go! 
12337 4 This camera is a must for every hello kitty fan. It s adorable and very much worth the price. Easily the cutest camera I have ever owned & a crowd pleaser as well. 
12338 4 Great product, high quality, arrived quickly in the mail. 
12339 2 Works but battery doesn t fit 100% straight away. Gotta jiggle it to snap on. 
12340 3 They fit well, good replacement! 
12341 2 good 
12342 4 These are legit. 
12343 3 Well designed, very functional. Light weight. 
12344 1 Bad battery. if leave charging all night will only fill half battery but if you leave charging for a couple hours will be 90% but don t last to long before die so I can t charge overnight and I can t trust when is full. 
12345 4 Caps better designed than original manufacturer s cap. 
12346 3 Used our floats at the beach and they worked very well. Love the bright colors for easy detection in the water. Only concern is the thin cord which could break easily. Only time will tell for that. Excellent customer service! 
12347 4 Fantastic little radio triggers!! Love em. 
12348 0 This battery did not work. Will never buy again. 
12349 4 Has been a great pack for my SLR! It has kept it safe on hikes and during travel! 
12350 4 Everything arrived in a timely fashion. All was as advertised. Best of all the hoods and filter work well together and readily go on my 52 mm lenses. I am very satisfied. 
12351 4 Perfect 
12352 4 Perfect fit. Sturdy. 
12353 4 A++++++++ 
12354 4 works like a charm! 
12355 2 Its just good 
12356 3 A gift--got rave reviews. 
12357 3 This worked great for about three months then the legs started loosening up. 
12358 2 This is great looks almost faded though. Not real bright. 
12359 1 Didn t work out for me 
12360 4 Excellent 
12361 3 Named after horseradish LMAO!! Works okay and price is good. Just for backup. I use the Nikon battery as long as it has juice. 
12362 4 Love it. Who would have thought that something so inexpensive could make my $250 Canon speedlite better. Fits perfectly and seems to provide 
12363 3 Optically excellent. I m coming from the crappy 28-100mm f/3.5-5.6 kit lens from 2002. If your sample has the squeak it s really annoying. Oh, well. That s what I get for going the cheapest used I could find. 
12364 3 It s handy and compact, but sometimes the camera makes it too top-heavy if you re using it as a tripod...the little legs are not enough of a base. Works well for hand extension though! 
12365 4 Pretty good. Better than low end go pros but not as good as the very expensive ones. But for the price you can t complain. 1080p 30fps and a screen. 
12366 4 very good for this price, i use rarely, so, cant say a lot about it 
12367 4 Gr8 product for the price i pay 
12368 4 Fits my Panasonic Lumix camera at a great price for 2 batteries and charger. Charger also recharges Panasonic battery that came with the camera. Panasonic doesn t provide charger for the battery. Camera has to be plugged in & that is a nuisance. This way I always have extra batteries. 
12369 3 liner not glued very well! selfie stick spins around!! HEAD GEAR GREAT!! 
12370 0 Doesn t work. or i was sent a remote with a dead battery 
12371 4 Loving this Dlink Wireless 
12372 4 Works perfectly 
12373 4 Very good quality, indistinguishable from a name brand item. 
12374 4 Love the improvements. 
12375 4 For the price it is great. It takes some getting use to for opening but it makes sense when you see it 
12376 4 Love this camera. The price is really good compared to the same exact model at Best Buy. 
12377 4 Convenient for my DSLR. Haven t tried remote but that was one of the major reasons I bought this package. Great combo. 
12378 3 Gets the job done.clear picture works great. 
12379 4 Good price ... exactly as expected. 
12380 4 Excellent 
12381 4 Very good quality for the price 
12382 3 This is the new hobby to keep me relatively 
12383 3 Good, versatile bag. Nice solution for dividing compartments and to take out the entire cushion assembly. Very good weatherproofing. I am missing smaller organizing pockets, say, in the flap. Carrying options: shoulder strap, hand carrying strap, attach to suitcase. 
12384 2 items are ok to use. 
12385 3 Glad to see I m not the only one who couldn t fold the thing back up!! Will be making a trip to YouTube for a video! Great size though! Large enough for someone to get in and move around comfortably. 
12386 3 Easy to use and the included case is a plus 
12387 4 Love it 
12388 4 So in love with the cell phone mount for my go pro. Now I can take it to theme parks and it s easier to record/shoot pictures and videos! I do recommend this product to other people!! 
12389 4 the stand is pretty good quality for its price.............the fabric is thick and heavy...........i would buy again 
12390 0 Battery fit into charger but could not get battery out of charger. Had to use a small screw driver. 
12391 0 only used it for a day and it broke. Invest the extra bucks for quality. Lesson Learned 
12392 4 I like it 
12393 4 Excelente producto. 
12394 4 I bought this lens as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it. It came to my house right on time and there are no problems with it. Overall it was a perfectly successful order. 
12395 4 Great 
12396 4 Great lens cleaners at an unbeatable price. 
12397 0 Didn t work at all! 
12398 4 it really helps when video recording with a camera that has no light 
12399 4 So far so good. 
12400 4 The product was perfect in condition and package was apt. I d recommend this to anyone looking for an intermediate level photography. 
12401 3 Great product! 
12402 4 Works perfectly and such a great deal. Definitely recommend for shots where a slow shutter speed is needed and you want to eliminate any camera shake. 
12403 0 Like the idea it seems to work but there is no way to play SD card on your computer you have to use the dvr I thought you would be able to emailed several time hard to get point across its sitting in a box 
12404 4 works great the only downer is my lens cap does not fit it as it is bigger opening but it functions like a pro. 
12405 0 Took it and phone to shop and they couldn t get anything out of even after hours of trying to charge it. 
12406 4 Great color. I should have gone with a smaller width. I ended up cutting mine, which was a pain, so keep that in mind. Paper is very sturdy and suits my needs well. I love not having to deal with fabric wrinkles. 
12407 4 Awesome idea. Didn t fully test it but I also bought Joto waterproof pouch and brought my iPhone on the river. 
12408 4 the best thing ever ;) 
12409 3 Looks good and fits well. A good idea for protecting the lens but have no way of evaluating the optical benefits. 
12410 4 Illuminati 
12411 3 a great handycam 
12412 4 Excellent product. Strong, light and easily carried on airplanes. Brilliant idea. Works well with my SonyAE7R light-weight full-frame. I ve had several Manfrotto products, and I like them all. 
12413 1 The seams are very visible, and my white backdrop was torn. 
12414 0 Absolute piece of crap. After the update it won t work anymore. Hugely disappointed! DO NOT BUY! There is no way to contact the manufacturer for a replacement or anything. It s a rip off. Amazon needs to step in and stop these douchebags from selling here. 
12415 3 Recommended. :) 
12416 4 works fine 
12417 4 Great, worth the price 
12418 3 I like it, good for the price 
12419 3 A great package! Everything is new, all counted for. The price is awesome for how much accessories you get with the camera. I think this bundle is the lowest priced on Amazon... or any market. On time shipping! 
12420 4 Great if you want a 40 mm. 
12421 4 Have been using this for our trip to california,oregon,washington and canada. Couldn t be happier and at such a great price!! 
12422 4 Love this camera does everything i want, takes great pictures and its pink! 
12423 3 It works well but have to be right on your idem to bee looked @ 
12424 3 Worked fine. 
12425 4 works great 
12426 4 Best carry on case you can buy... worth every penny. I use this for traveling in the Middle East and R&R carrying my Mac Air, Samsung Tablet 2014 Edition, iPad Air 2, ext. HDD, and charging cables. 
12427 4 Best drone for the price. Great company and deal with the extra batteries. 
12428 1 Doesn t allow you to add battery grip, unable to close. 
12429 3 Camera works great! Only downside is that the box didn t include a manual or memory card. 
12430 4 Very good item 
12431 4 Awesome product! 
12432 4 You can t beat it. It took the place of two lens that I have. 
12433 3 Great light. Just wish it was AA or AAA instead 
12434 4 The item showed up 4 days earlier than promised. The item is of high quality and I d recommend it to a friend 
12435 3 Book I received with it was not in English 
12436 3 Light weight, very adjustable, great fees tires. 
12437 4 The work great! 
12438 4 ok 
12439 1 small need extra to be studio 
12440 1 The arm are not very flexible, hard to bend.... 
12441 2 Not nearly as roomy as I thought it would be. 
12442 2 Handle with care! First time I mounted it, I got it stuck on my lens. Second time it got stuck in the body of my D7100. I would highly recommend getting a filter wrench at the same time you purchase the ring. 
12443 3 solid case/great for price 
12444 4 I can t say enough about this product, it does exactly what I wanted and it sharp corner to corner. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a Ultra-Wide. 
12445 4 The materials are good and sturdy, the parts fit together nicely, but putting in the rods requires a bit of strength. My recommendation is to put it together and leave it assembled. This one is the perfect size for my purposes. 
12446 2 Excellent purchase. Very fast shipping. The flash kit comes as described and fitted perfectly on my Nikon D7000. It worked wonderful. I really loved the difusser. 
12447 2 Falls off camera too easily, already lost this viewfinder 
12448 2 came with missing screw 
12449 4 its a decent quality camera for the price. just wish that it would also record so wont have to watch it every so often. the cloud notifications dont fully work, other then this it allows me to see whats going on in my place while im not home. 
12450 4 Love it its so cute and able to carry any where :) 
12451 4 Love this lens,. Light, small, and photo quality is awesome,. Using it together with my D7000, takes good sharp photos,. really like it a lot. 
12452 4 Bought to calibrate laptop screen. Works exactly as it should and it was easy to use. 
12453 2 ok for the money, but not what i wanted so i returned it for a higher quality and more expensice tripod 
12454 4 Perfect for keeping all of my photos safe and organized. Love this will purchase again. It actually arrived sooner than I thought it would couldn t be happier with this purchase. 
12455 4 Great camera using it to film skateboarding with a neewer 37mm fisheye and opteka x grip 
12456 4 Perfect for what I needed. Great quality. 
12457 0 taped thru the middle all the way across. folded like an accordion so folds won t come out..can t use as a background. 
12458 4 Definitely good to have extra batteries when you re out and about. If you re filmong for the day, you don t always have a place to recharge. Fast shipping. Good price. 
12459 4 Works like original. 
12460 3 The case is really nice. It s sturdy, well made and comfortable when wearing it. My only complaint is there is no place to put prop guards. I have to carry my prop guards outside of the case. 
12461 4 Nice, love. 
12462 3 These are good, they do what they re intended, which is to power an IP security camera, and are not expensive. 
12463 4 The screw in version installs differently than the bayonet mount (aside from the obvious difference). This video was extremely helpful in getting the latch closed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CsoNmlFZMU Be sure to run your finger over the latch from the attached side rather than trying to just push it in. 
12464 2 The product was OK. Would not fit my Camera. I think it s the Camera. 
12465 0 I was looking forward to receiving these but I was disappointed. They were already broken before I could put them on. One of the arms was in a few pieces I will probably use the parts to make something different. 
12466 2 Ok. 
12467 4 Great case 
12468 3 Nice and small and works well 
12469 3 When I used this, it completely drained a newly charged camera battery in 3 hours. Thankfully I own a backup battery. Otherwise it s awesome! 
12470 4 It wasnt exactly what I had in mind, but was easily adaptable so great! 
12471 4 I would definitely recommend this product. Good value for money and looks great. 
12472 3 Amazing gopro piece ! 
12473 4 This film turned out great! Just keep your exposure to the darkest you can. 
12474 1 the image quality of the camera was terrible so I returned it... not sure if my camera was defective or generally the 240p sucks! Setting up its wireless connection was so easy and using it whenever there is an outlet was practical. 
12475 4 Works like a charm... nice clean professional look 
12476 3 works well 
12477 3 The size it s very practical, too small. 
12478 4 Love Canon products... they seem to surpass most other brands with features and performance... 
12479 4 Amazing very sturdy mount stays in 5 out of 5 
12480 3 A bit snug for my camera, but it is very nice and it was a great price! 
12481 4 I love this lens, picture quality is very good. I was unsure about going with a brand other than nikon but glad I did now 
12482 0 Doesn t work outside USA 
12483 3 Very fast service. Great to work with. Camera is very nice. 
12484 4 i ve owned other B+W protective filters and bought this one based on those previous experiences. i m very happy with the quality of images that i m able to capture on a sony a7r. it s like the filter isn t even there. great product. 
12485 4 good and fast 
12486 0 The sticker did not fit and fell off right away. Terrible item. Waste of money. 
12487 4 Got this for my Canon T31 and it works perfectly, also works well on my film camera. Great product and great price! 
12488 4 They work. A couple have been in use for a few months now without issue. This was a good buy. 
12489 4 They work great and the picture quality is good. My only complaint which has nothing to do with the camera at all is that they are not cheap to develop. 
12490 4 Very good ! I love it !!!! 
12491 4 Works great. Very happy with the purchase. 
12492 4 Using on my Fujifilm S1 camera. Great price and a product I will recommend. 
12493 4 I bought these for my Nikon Coolpix L830 and they seemed to do the trick! I am happy with the product, thanks again Amazon! 
12494 1 Came with chinese firmware and seller only directed me to Dahau. Dahau support is non existent. This camera is actually the lowest end Dahau..I would suggest the 2xxx or 4xxx models over this for a fe more $ 
12495 4 Great Product 
12496 3 Everything okey 
12497 3 Fiddly to set up but it does work. 
12498 4 Worked out really nice. 
12499 0 What can I say....it broke 3 minutes into my ride. It was lose so I gave it another turn and it fell apart. Plastic junk. 
12500 4 what a great kit for a great price 
12501 0 Flash will not work anymore. Only 1 day after purchase. This thing is bad!!! 
12502 0 It was nice 
12503 4 This is a good deal - two batteries, a house charger, and an adapter for the car, all at a good price. 
12504 4 Worked as expected. Thank you. 
12505 4 you will not regret spending the high price on this one 
12506 4 Awesome product and great customer support by POMBO! Quality camera and accessories at a amazing product = satisfied customer 
12507 3 Perfect for the price every thing works but I have one complain, the screw that holds the position of the suction cup is no holding it, but the other things are perfect!! 
12508 0 It doesn t zoom well 
12509 4 Good quality. Great price. 
12510 4 all the pieces work great with my GoPro HERO! 
12511 4 Nice 
12512 4 So far, its been outstanding. Lens is sharp for such as wide range zoom and the noise on he camera is remarkably low at iso 6400. 
12513 4 met and/or exceeded all expectations 
12514 3 Difficult to set up but once it is set up correctly, it works like a charm. If your kit weighs more than about 3-4 lbs, this is not the stabilizer for you. 
12515 3 Love this. Is not auto-focus on Ds3100, but I prefer to use manual. 
12516 4 Lens caps fit perfect on my Pentax Digital SLR. Package arrived on time! 
12517 4 Very useable and interchangeables. 
12518 3 I have this camera. It worked for a few months and I got a few worthwhile images from it. It likes bright sun and works well in the water. The good thing about this camera is the price. 
12519 4 Excellent camera strap! Very fashionable and useful strap. 
12520 4 Price was good and its a great battery for the Phantom 1.. 
12521 3 SONY engineering always seem to make weird design decisions. This time, they removed the IR receiver which has been available in all previous models. So I can flip the LCD screen 180 degree but there is no easy way to trigger the shutter. Brilliant!! 
12522 2 Too much noise. Any suggestions on how to reduce the noise? (AIR) 
12523 3 looks good 
12524 1 It s just a tripod inside a box. The tripod itself is fine, but don t market it as &#34;with a bag&#34; if you re not going to include it. 
12525 2 Worth the money, filters add more creativity, but are hard to focus with them on. 
12526 3 I love this camera. Takes good pics and is very user friendly, not a ton of confusing buttons. It s kind of bulky and it s hard to find a case that fits it, but I would say that s the only con. 
12527 3 Fits the tripod well. Looks k=like it will do the job needed 
12528 4 Fantastic Little Tripod That Will Grip Almost Anything!!! 
12529 4 Great filter, spendy but high quality professional. 
12530 2 not what I expected. 
12531 4 This battery from Sterlingtek works just as good as the Nikon battery that came with my d7100. Great purchase! 
12532 4 Great gift item. 
12533 4 Does what it needs to. 
12534 0 I ONLY GOT ONE SET, NOT TWO! SO this was a JOKE of a product! 
12535 0 This item ripped in several places on the first use. The quality was horrible. 
12536 4 Works perfect on any 50mm lens, bought it for my Canon. Works great! 
12537 4 Good 
12538 0 Bad product and bad documentation, it has issues to function. It is surprisingly that a leader brand like Nikon develops a product like this. Another story is the software which is realy poor. I don t recommend it 
12539 4 This bag was much better than I anticipated! I was originally going to buy myself a different bag! But this one will definitely do the trick! 
12540 4 works just fine 
12541 4 Excellent case,rugged and it s Waterproof,just right for a GoPro Camera. 
12542 4 Excellent quality at a great price. Fit my light perfectly. 
12543 4 great battery. 
12544 2 I very much like the camera, but there was no lens cover or instruction Manuel 
12545 4 Great simple way to carry your lens cap. Stays on tight. 
12546 3 Film worked as intended, wish it was less cost effective, remember to not shake the photos and to place in the box the film came in to help develop them faster. 
12547 4 good 
12548 4 Great mini tripod, what you would expect from Manfrotto, stylish, light, usable and the mobile phone attachment is very easy to use. 
12549 2 It has a lot of use and think it is really reliable. 
12550 4 I d highly recommend for ease of use and a balanced posture. If you shoot a lot, this is very handy. 
12551 2 Just fine 
12552 4 ok 
12553 0 Not up to the expectation. Would recommend Nikon COOLPIX S5300 instead of this model. 
12554 4 Exactly what I wanted. Easy to install. Very flexible to meet differing needs. Used for protection in my separate garage. 
12555 4 It works 
12556 4 Definitely not a GoPro 4 Silver, but that is not what is aiming to be. Simpler controls and a more responsive LCD screen make this camera great for beginners and people on a budget. I would highly recommend this over the HERO. 
12557 3 I really enjoyed the product and the pouch is incredibly handy for stowing safely, however the Polarized lens does not screw in tight. It stays put, but will come off if pressure is applied in the outward direction. 
12558 3 as expected 
12559 4 It is so nice to have back up batteries for whatever purpose, so the price and quality of this product was great! 
12560 3 Easy to use. Sleek. I like the options for uploading pictures. My husband enjoyed his birthday gift. :) 
12561 4 Great batteries 
12562 3 Exactly as expected delivery was a bit slow. 
12563 4 Use is monitor my baby as baby monitor, it works very well. 
12564 0 Does not make a smooth uninterrupted scan no matter how fast, slow or careful you are with it. You get what you are willing to pay for it, I guess. 
12565 4 Expensive, but worth the money. Comfortable, well designed, good quality. 
12566 4 Great câmera. I had some trouble ajusting the flash light when taking pics on a sunny day. But the camera is super fun to use and practical too 
12567 4 Connected to raspberry pi. Works like a charm. Worked right out of the box. Definitely worth the price. 
12568 4 Comfortable. 
12569 4 I am having a blast with this little camera. The photos are small but they are tons of fun. I like the double-exposure feature for creative special effects. (Note-there is trial and error involved in that! But it s fun and works). Great colors in the prints 
12570 4 Great! 
12571 4 Love it! 
12572 1 This camera is mediocre at best. I recommend going to Walmart and buying a canon elph for less. I own a 7d and iPhone 5s. I prefer iPhone 5s over s110 pics. 
12573 4 Camera take great videos. Came with lots o accessories. Waterproof case works great. Great camera for the price. You can click on the links below to view sample videos.

12574 3 ok 
12575 4 Convenient, space saving way to hang multiple backgrounds 
12576 4 Love it! Great quality at an affordable price. Safely packaged and quick delivery. 
12577 4 Great camera easy to set up except for the wifi portion which I have yet to figure out. But love being able to spy on my pets at home. Night vision works. I like all the functions of the camera. 
12578 0 The usb charging port already broke. 
12579 4 Excellant binoculars ...(and I bought used ones!) 
12580 3 The color was a little off between materials, but the thing is very usefully and I am happy I bought it. 
12581 4 Awesome, does so much more than I expected! 
12582 4 Lens came fast and in perfect condition. Its a quality lens and takes great photos. 
12583 0 I couldn t get this harness to fit at all. I m female 5 5&#34;. When I adjusted it to the correct length I was unable to raise my binoculars to my eyes.Definately not a product that will work for everyone. Returned without any problems. 
12584 2 Cool. 
12585 4 love it 
12586 3 Good quality. Sturdy.. only problem is blue tooth not compatible with my phone :( other than that, good product. 
12587 4 The is a great deal and a GREAT drone. Tons of support videos on YouTube. The only manufacturer with a 60 warranty with support in USA. 
12588 4 Best deal I could find 
12589 3 No issues with this replacement battery for my Canon elph. Haven t stressed it to much, though; just casual usage. 
12590 4 Excellent tripod. I ve had it for about 10 years. 
12591 0 Broke right out of the box. 
12592 4 Nice 
12593 4 Saves my lens from scratches 
12594 3 help some 
12595 4 Does the does as expected. 
12596 4 Works well! 
12597 4 Great batteries. 
12598 4 New to FPV, if have found the technology to be challenging. But my learning curve has been appreciably accelerated by these folks. They sell great products, backed-up with great documentation and, most importantly, superior after-the-sale support. 
12599 4 I love this canvas, wish it was bigger. 
12600 0 Garbage, does not work!! 
12601 4 Best Price for a solid bundle! Hands down worth it! Thank you for this! 
12602 4 Nice camera strap it fits well 
12603 0 Worked fine when I first got it, and now a few months later, I go to record and nothing. No sound. 
12604 4 This photo studio is large and everything is high quality. May need to add more lights if it s pretty dark but works well for gloomy day product shoots and it gives it the extra light needed. 
12605 4 Great product 
12606 3 All the harnesses work great but the hand bar is unstable and always fell over, I had to tape it right side up. Everything else works great! 
12607 4 Wished it had an auto focus. But other than that, love it. 
12608 4 Perfect! 
12609 4 Great product and quick delivery. 
12610 4 Great item , makes for very nice and interesting camera angles. 
12611 4 Henry was helpful and patient in assisting me in setting up the camera and on my phone. These cameras are very durable and have good quality for the price. 
12612 4 Great, very very strong light! I ve said it before and I ll say it again... SATISFIED customer! Love it!! 
12613 2 So far so good. Only time will tell if this is a product worth more stars. 
12614 4 For the price and quality it worked just fine. I do recommend any one to get a heavy duty tripod. 
12615 4 Used these on a recent rafting trip, everything worked great! Selfie stick is as everyone has pointed out... Not great, the weight of the camera in a housing causes it to flip around on you. 
12616 3 Great set for the price. Didn t come with any explanation as to what lense is used for what purpose. Overall pleased. 
12617 3 Case Logic DCB-304 
12618 4 Works as expected, fits my Trek Alpha series just fine. 
12619 4 Perfect 
12620 4 Love it! 
12621 4 Awesome product sent in record time. 
12622 4 very nice product! nice and clear and does not affect my usage of my go pro. protects my screens well. thanks! 
12623 4 works as described 
12624 4 Good product as advertised. Pictures turned out very good and used at Cancun resort. 
12625 4 Good very good job 
12626 4 Received it a few days later than expected but no worries! 
12627 4 Bought this lens for Milky Way astrophotography and was not disappointed. Great lens for the price, so long as you don t mind manual focus. The nikon version comes with the right interface for the camera to control aperture, so all of the auto exposure stuff will work. 
12628 4 The transparent crystal case fits and goes perfect with my daughter s instax mini 25 hello kitty camera. She loves it and thank you. 
12629 3 Cut my finger on a shard of steel that was leftover from the machining process on one of the balljoints. But the arm works well, locks into place, and is stable. 
12630 4 Was perfect for our daughter s wedding photo booth! 
12631 0 I wanted extra batteries for an upcoming research trip to Mongolia. Sadly, this held an incredibly low charge and was next to useless. Very disappointed. 
12632 4 lots of mounts 
12633 4 The only time that is a good thing 
12634 0 I got this because I m a bit p-noid sometimes...this only made it worse!! I get it and test it out, the signal was going off every where, my tv, my ceiling fan, my cable box and spots in my ceiling I which is probably an electric junction box. 
12635 4 As advertised, fits the camera like a glove 
12636 4 Perfect solution to lighting up our pond at night and shutting the lights off from inside our home. 
12637 4 Works as described! Alerts me on my iPhone of any movement or noise in my home. App allows me to see what s going on from wherever I am. Works day and night. 
12638 4 BEST SELLER... HOPE TO DEAL WITH YOU AGAIN, 5 STARS FOR SURE 
12639 3 easy set up - high def only thing is that not enough controlled access when used as a nanny web cam compared to another webcam that i ditched [Belkin], this one never lost connection to the network 
12640 3 Seem fine and strong, but only time and many uses will really prove these as good product. They are fatter than most of my other Nimh AAs, so they don t fit well in some applications. 
12641 2 Camera is OK for the price. A little slow on focusing and pictures are not spectacular, but it is a decent enough point-and-shoot for brightly lit scenes. 
12642 4 Mounts the the bag and does not move at all. Awesome build quality 
12643 4 My new favorite lens 
12644 4 great quality mount. holds firm and is easy to setup 
12645 4 Good looking fake camera. Happy with the purchase, 
12646 4 Good for this price 
12647 4 Very nice Case for my camera. Looks sturdy and cool. Would recommend it 
12648 4 very good 
12649 4 Fast and Reliable. Will order again soon! 
12650 4 protects tiny camera 
12651 4 keeps it floating... 
12652 4 Works exactly as it should. There s not much to say about it, it s a handle that floats. When dropped into the water it floats as it should. I ve never had problems with the mount either. The strap is comfortable and can tighten on your wrist. 
12653 4 Henry Campbell helped with the issues with my foscam setup, he finished within 5 minutes, all of their technical support persons have good knowledge 
12654 4 Very easy to use. AFFORDABLE, STURDY. I have used it many times for off camera flash projects. WOULD BUY AGAIN! 
12655 4 Prompt delivery. Substantially cheaper than another charger I had priced at a local camera shop. Works perfectly. 
12656 4 Goood 
12657 4 excellent product! love it 
12658 1 Worked great until it died six months later. 
12659 4 Nice backpack. We ordered multiple of these and like them better than DJI version. But would like the price to match DJI price if we are to order anymore. 
12660 3 This fit well on my D5300, not a perfect fit but good enough, I think that I should ve taken more care putting it on. 
12661 4 Just works! No complaints about quality or delivery time. Will be purchasing another. 
12662 4 Bought as a present for someone who is very pleased as he now can clean all his lenses etc properly. 
12663 4 Just started using.. Seems a step above the average Chinese replacement battery. The items were well presented with well done packaging. 
12664 4 Sweet camera for the money and hard-to-find No Infrared option in a bullet. You can use these thru a window or other places you d like discreet surveillance minus the giveaway of infrared bulbs. The included power adapter is a nice touch. I will buy more of these! 
12665 1 Constantly switches to channel 1 instead of staying on channel you set it on. Also, lots of interferences and loud ringing despite systems being place far apart (different floors). 
12666 4 Works exactly as advertised as well as very handy. It also is possible to purchase and extension cable to longer remote controlling. 
12667 3 Exactly what we needed! 
12668 3 Product is good the battery I ordered was not, the one I had here did fit fine. I had an off brand that did not fit, fits in camera though! 
12669 4 Camera is great. Could not get the SmartGuard Protection Plan registered. SmartGuard would not take the information. NOT GOOD!!!!!!!!!! 
12670 4 I wasn t certain that this mount would work with my 3Pod H5 ballhead, but it does. Solidly made, and a great value! 
12671 2 The die quickly. But you get what you pay. Cheap price=cheap quality. 
12672 4 Great! 
12673 4 One of the best lenses made! 
12674 3 I like this case it works perfect and half the price 
12675 4 &#34;If you only carry one of these this is the one, extends out longer and remote is keyfob size , i can use with ALL my cameras 
12676 4 Purchased a 95mm and was impressed so I purchased another UV Filter at 67mm and once again am very pleased with the purchase. Fits perfectly and threads are smooth. Just purchased two more and expect the same excellent quality. 
12677 4 Matches my nikon d5200 body perfectly. Doesnt add too much weight to the already heavy camera. 
12678 4 One of my best investments ever. To start on the world of Digital SLR photography, this is it and much more.. 
12679 1 I may have bought the wrong case as this doesn t fit the stuff very well can t quite get a handle on where stuff is supposed to go. Next time will purchase larger case where I have options on cut outs. May work for you though. 
12680 4 great 
12681 4 Still works good after many years. 
12682 4 love it, but thinking of getting something lighter for my hike... 
12683 4 Replacement (upgrade) for my Fuji X-E1. 
12684 0 This item is really unattractive and not functional. Also they charged me $7 to return it??? Terrible. DO NOT BUY! 
12685 3 heck ya 
12686 3 Nice and useful set. Quality matches price. Shipping was fast and packaging was fine. Minor scratches on watch stand, but the watch band covers this when it s used. 
12687 4 Arrived promptly and works as expected 
12688 3 Decent binoculars for the price. Great size. 
12689 4 Worth every penny. Loved the videos. More functions that I haven t used yet. Small fits in palm of hand. Great purchase 
12690 4 I upgraded from the A35 to the A7S and all my Full frame Lens work perfectly on the A-mount to E-mount adapter. 
12691 1 Much too small to comfortably hold my Canon 70D with a 50mm lens. It fits but you have to stretch like mad. 
12692 4 Great camera. Easy to use. Takes great pictures. 
12693 4 love it will be order again sometime soon. 
12694 2 I like the camera but when using the fisheye lens underwater, water gets between the fisheye and normal camera lens. 
12695 4 I have already recommend to my friends 
12696 4 &#34;Very good product. I like.Thank the seller to send a birthday gift Integrity of the seller.&#34; 
12697 4 good price and product 
12698 4 This is one of the best. Very durable. Zooming option is nice and clear. I owe one for about 7 years now and have no regrets buying it. Nice piece of equipment. 
12699 4 This is the only kind of lens cleaning paper I usually order. Always does the job and is not flimsy to use. This product arrived in the time they said it would arrive. I m happy with my purchase. 
12700 4 Good product, very durable, shipping was EXTREMELY fast... I ordered this case on a Saturday and paid for 2 day shipping and it showed up the day after i ordered it, on a Sunday... I didn t even know I could get deliveries on Sundays haha. Overall very satisfied. 
12701 4 Replaced a 10 yr old alert that is no longer made. This one is much better - it has volume selection and choice of sound. It works from 1/8 mile from the house. Lpve it. 
12702 4 We use it as a back door alarm at our senior thrift store. It works great. 
12703 4 Great, met all of my expectations 
12704 4 Perfect bag for everyday use, lots of storage potential and places to put different things! 
12705 4 Really great! The video is so smooth and the glasses are so stylish that I can wear them out and nobody knows what they are. 
12706 4 It worked great 
12707 4 This is my additional order. I bought 3 before from different seller. I use it on my off flash n strobes 
12708 2 Item is what it says it is and arrived as such. Just didn t do much to take out jello. On increasing height I would still get the wobble. Only reason for three stars as it just wasn t what I needed. Item was flawless in description and delivery. 
12709 4 Tough and easy to use. A great tripod 
12710 3 Pare soleil efficace 
12711 3 Great addition to the Orion 4.5 StarBlast, nice wide field of view. 
12712 4 This was easy to install, works like it was advertised and best of all I can easily view what the cameras are seeing from thousands of miles away. One more plus, it is superior to the wifi cameras in cost and it is hard wired. 
12713 4 Excellent hi-quality product and seller 
12714 4 Bought for my 12 year old grandson. He loves using it when he is riding his bike. 
12715 4 Great quality for a super low price. I use this on my sony action cam for motorcycle riding. It is directional so the wind noise does not affect the mic in my helmet. 
12716 0 This hood is not worth ordering. It does not securely mount onto my Canon lens, and has fallen off more than a few times. It is only a matter of time before I loose it for good (which at this point I am okay with). 
12717 0 good 
12718 3 No comments 
12719 4 ok 
12720 4 Lost my power for my camera this one works great 
12721 2 Nicely built bag that actually protects your camera but I hated how bulky this was. I brought this with me while I was vacationing and it was a pain having to lug this thing around. 
12722 4 Works great! Have been doing some landscape tripod shots and this remotes is a good product at a good price. 
12723 4 The lens hood came in an official Sony Box. It fit my lens as advertised. 
12724 4 I bought these as a gift for my wife and she loves it and its an actually steal... 
12725 4 Begginer photographer here so I don t know a ton but the product was as described and I m very happy with it. 
12726 3 Case is a little bulky for putting into a camera case so i can t actually carry it with me but it all works well 
12727 4 Excellent product Terry Morgan was very helpful! 
12728 0 When I attached it to my camera it wouldn t focus at all 
12729 0 i think maybe they lit for one night, then dead, nothing. get them at Home Depot instead. I should of. 
12730 4 Nice luv it 
12731 4 Fogged up due to humidity the first time I used it but that was my fault for not setting it out sooner in the outside air. 
12732 4 Works great! I use to get dizzy when watching my video but now I don t have that issue using the gimbal. A must have. 
12733 4 The package came as described, the light is very bright and works well for macro photography! 
12734 0 As soon as I put my flash, the clamp would fall and lost it grip. Not worth the price 
12735 2 Super hard to get pictures under water as you can t see anything on the screen but it s okay. I got a couple good pics and it s decent price/quality ration. :) 
12736 2 Pictures are O.K.,but deleting is a pain. 
12737 4 as described. Thanks! 
12738 3 Good props 
12739 4 Awesome product… 
12740 4 Great Product at a Great Price with fast shipping 
12741 4 Works well with a Nikon D3200, but autofocus with the Tamron 150-600 lens is hit and miss dependent on the light. At longer zoom settings you will need a tripod, or a lot of light and high shutter speeds, as expected since any movement blurs. 
12742 1 The product is described as HD / 720p camera. The quality when viewing through the Web app or mobile app while the camera was connected via ethernet, is clearly not HD. We have 2 other cameras on the same network and also 720p which have a much higher quality. 
12743 3 It works, but it s...big. It bulges over the side a bit more than it seems like it should, creating a lip on the end of my lens. This metal lip makes getting to the lens cap more difficult than it needs to be. 
12744 4 Purchased this for snorkling in Key West for our Canon Elph. It works great. I m sure it s not nearly as good as an actual underwater camera but for the price this case it s a keeper! 
12745 4 I mostly use it with a Canon T3i with a nifty-fifty and the 85mm 1.8 and the rest of the space (about half the bag) with things for work...so far I m happy with it. 
12746 1 has issues ... tilt axis keeps drifting even with a perfectly balanced camera. I ve used the GH4 and Blackmagic cinema and same issue with both cameras. Calling DJI is a joke and gets you NOTHING done. 
12747 4 I love this tripod, so versatile and well made 
12748 4 They look a little cheap, but they work perfectly. Strong clamp, good size for what I need. 
12749 4 does an excellent job of keeping my gopro afloat and it latches on and closes very secure and snugly. great product and was shipped extremely fast! 
12750 4 Worked perfectly ,good quality, arrived quickly AND inexpensive 
12751 1 Bulky, heavy, picture quality not impressive. 
12752 4 Exactly as advertised and works perfectly with Nikon Coopix510 camera. Great price for all that is included. 
12753 4 Product came as promised and came earlier than expected! Good price too! 
12754 4 Love this thing!! Super easy to use and takes great videos. 
12755 4 Very pleased with the camera and especially the price... 
12756 4 You can literally set up your go-pro anywhere and on anything. This was a great bundle package and super inexpensive. 
12757 4 Amazing video clarity for the price. 
12758 4 My daughter loves it came on time it s so cute!! 
12759 4 Great lens. Works perfectly. Shipped fast. 
12760 4 great set 
12761 4 It was as listed. 
12762 4 Very acurate very easy to use Test xlr 1/4 midi 3/8 rca 
12763 4 Great product! 
12764 4 Purchased to mount on a roll bar on an open-cockpit racecar. I have used it for one full day (about 3 hours of track driving including some off-track excursions) and it performed flawlessly, no shaking and never loosened up. It was received quickly and exactly as described. 
12765 4 Well built mount. It most important part of a mount is the it is solid with no vibration or slippage. This is a great mount. Likely I will order more. The ball joint allows infinite positioning possibilities. The best mount I have. 
12766 4 This new lens is most versatile lens by Nikon, in my opinion. I have many Nikon lenses over 40 years, and this one is the most convenient for my D700 and D750 in everyday and travel shootings. 
12767 4 Works like a champ. 
12768 4 Was exactly as described and came quickly! Very pleased! 
12769 0 Sucks... i need a serial code that they were supposed to give me to use the software so i can t use it until I get it. 
12770 4 Great for the price, avoid digital zoom of course. 
12771 4 Great camera mount. I bought it as a gift for my mountain biking cousin and she loves it. It is very sturdy and solid. 
12772 3 good value 
12773 1 Very nice camera. Software not user friendly. Spent hours trying to set camera up. Called tech support, they had problem had to download a fix. Reset camera, then could not log in ... return camera within a week. 
12774 4 Camera was in excellent condition. 
12775 4 Worked as advertised 
12776 4 Excellent product! Great alternative too name brand batteries. Worked great in my Nikon D5000. 
12777 4 It is a pelican. Need I say more... 
12778 4 This is s superb tripod! I couldn t be happier! 
12779 4 Batteries fit in a hero 4 silver without issue and last just as well as the factory. Charger works well. 
12780 4 must have for people who misplace their cap all the time 
12781 4 I will recommend this to anybody 
12782 1 Doesn t hold a charge. Runs down quickly. I get 70 pictures on 50% of the charge. normally I can get 350 pictures on 60% usage 
12783 4 Currently on vacation and haven t taken the go pro off of this stick. It s durable and perfect for us. Goes underwater, in the sand and even the basic stuff. Great product 
12784 4 It fitted my camera well. 
12785 4 all good thanks .. 
12786 3 Can t speak to the quality of the power output but in the field they last roughly as long as my Canon batteries. 
12787 4 works goood 
12788 4 I ve used these for a few months and I really enjoy them. 
12789 4 Love this HD camera 
12790 4 fast delivery and low price. 
12791 4 It can record on SD card and on laptop, recording is easy and automated. 32GB micro SD card holds more than 60 hours of recording and it keeps on recovering.Great camera and great image. 
12792 4 Strong., easy to use. 
12793 4 Fabulous. I cannot believe I was able to take such awesome video of the moon. This technology is amazing. I photoshopped my cat on the moon. Thanks so much for a great product! 
12794 0 Great idea, worked great for about a month then started having all kinds of problems. Would like to see someone build a more durable and reliable unit and charge more for it. 
12795 4 I wish it was 1080p but I m still happy with it. 
12796 4 Perfect fit, easy installation. Always a good idea to help preserve the condition of your screen. 
12797 4 good enough 
12798 4 More than what we need for taking pictures and for identification of small insects. I shall highly recommend it. 
12799 0 Too small to comfortably hold Coolpix S33. 
12800 0 No windows 8 drivers, not compatible 
12801 4 Arrived swiftly. Battery works great! 
12802 4 Works great! Can a photographer ever have too many backup batteries and chargers? 
12803 3 very good purchase. my camera would not work with the old battery that came with the camera. I tried charging it several times but nothing worked. so glad that amazon had these in stock. 
12804 3 It works! Easy to setup. 
12805 4 Work like it should. 
12806 4 Daylight, nightlight, whatever you shoot in, this thing will pick it up. Even in the case, you can still make out low voices talking, and the clarity is astonishingly better than I expected. For the price, you can t beat it. I plan on ordering a few more very soon. 
12807 3 Cheap, comes with everything you would ever need! Not as strong as GoPro (after 4 weeks a mount broke) The selfie stick (mono pod) tend to rotate a bit, but not to the point where it s unusable. 
12808 4 Just might be the best lens on the market, at least for headshots anyway. Super sharp, super crisp and the autofocus is amazing. Many complain about its weight, but that makes about as much sense as saying a Ferrari s engine is too loud. Happy shooting, Vroom Vroom. 
12809 4 good product 
12810 4 A+++ 
12811 4 This recharged batteries quickly and I was happy that I received it just as fast before the kids went to camp. 
12812 4 This is a great little case for the money. Works for me! Nicely made. I would recommend this anyone that doesn t have a case for their camera. Love it! 
12813 4 Perfect!!! 
12814 4 Cheap and works good 
12815 4 Best training quad for the money ! Stable and responsive. Buy extra batteries ! 
12816 4 Got these to use with my Eco shopping totes. Just the right size and padding is great. 
12817 4 Works as described and a must have for vacations. 
12818 0 Does not fit the Canon EFS 18-55 IS. The lens has 3 tabs, the hood only has 2. Returning to Amazon. I don t know how the people that answered questions got it to fit unless they have a different version of the 18-55 from Canon. 
12819 4 Great bag. Well made. Plenty of room and great compartments.. 
12820 3 Very good for a reasonable price. 
12821 4 It was easy to install with Synology Surveillance Station. Excellent image quality. 
12822 0 too dificult to operate 
12823 4 Probably will fit Most compact cameras. A MUST BUY! 
12824 2 These are ok but not great. 
12825 4 Great lense 
12826 4 I m glad and I like it! 
12827 3 Gave this camera to my 12 year old granddaughter and she has loved it! Is putting together picture albums and going thru film like crazy. This is what she picked out for her birthday and she has enjoyed it ever since. Great little product here. 
12828 4 I have purchased smaller cleaning cloths for my glasses. They were hard to use because they were small. I now only use them when I carry them in my pant pockets. These extra large cloths are AWESOME. No problem cleaning your eye glasses with them. I highly recommend. 
12829 4 Product does the job, as described. Doesn t scratch screen or glasses. Cleans smudges and fingerprints quickly. Good deal. 
12830 4 amazing device, smart idea. 
12831 4 works great with T3i 
12832 4 the BEST !!!! i want 10 of these !!! takes a contour from dead rto full in 45 less minutes. ALSO takes a GoPro from dead to full in about 40 less minutes. 
12833 4 Terrific camera with better IQ than A7ii. Easy to shoot hand held which is notable for a high megapixel camera.only negative I can think of is that it is a bit heavier than the A7ii. 
12834 4 Wow, amazing camera and I m a total rookie when it comes to photography. Easy to use and take clear professional type Photos. Excellent battery life also makes this machine amazing.. Love it, don t hesitate. 
12835 4 Ive had this for a while now with no problems never thought id find a charger for my fe-20 and i believe it shipped pretty soon 
12836 4 Great camera. Great price. 
12837 4 This kit takes out all quest work of gopro accesories, this covers the bases from the case to the tripod.the extra batteries are also very helpful,couldn t ask for more 
12838 0 Nope didnt like it 
12839 4 It does exactly what I wanted it to do 
12840 4 Rock solid. Even at 125 mph! 
12841 4 Good price for the amount of options! 
12842 0 My order was for 5 cameras- 3 of them arrived broken beyond repair. Of the 5, zero of them have a functioning light. They are passable as cameras but your odds are low that they ll arrive in usable condition. 
12843 4 Does the job! Used it for our honeymoon in New Zealand and Fiji. The camera was floating in several scenarios including swimming pools, rivers, and oceans! 
12844 0 Horrible super cheap made! They should not be selling this item it all I give it zero stars!! Please don t buy this item you will be very disappointed! I promise! 
12845 4 Easy to use and set up. Great item 
12846 4 EXCELLENT 
12847 4 I have to say I saw quite a few mixed reviews. So far the lens is working out fantastic for all the landscape pictures I take and stars!! 
12848 4 it works and there you go. 
12849 4 The battery charger is exactly what I needed and it was shipped and delivered on time. 
12850 2 The item works fine but the housing was dinged up. It looked used. 
12851 4 Very good quality of pictures and videos, love it!!! Great accessories too, couldn t get better deal for my money. 
12852 2 Works for light camera bodies/lenses. A bit difficult to hold still when attatch a medium telephoto prime lens with a DSLR. 
12853 4 Terrific!!!!.... and the delivery was fast 
12854 4 Exactly what I expected! Arrived on time. 
12855 4 A+++++ 
12856 4 Good product. Would buy again. 
12857 4 I love it 
12858 3 these are great though we only received three instead of the four indicated. 
12859 4 Great way to be introduced to the effects among different filters. Gave this to someone who just got a new DSLR and thought they should have some lens protection. Case and filters have good construction feel 
12860 3 fit perfectly. Included a bonus - ability to tie the lens cap to the neck strap (won t lose it again). 
12861 4 Received item in good condition. Works with no problem at all. 
12862 4 Holds my camera with lens and 70-300 mm lens also. Room in pockets for gadgets. Bag resists water. 
12863 4 Excellent product, video is amazing, fast and quiet, micro SD is an extra for me, software support multiple cameras and multiple windows in same screen. EXCELLENT, this one replace a broken 0.3 PM Foscam and use it with my NAS system. 
12864 4 Henry from Foscam was great to work. He was able to get my camera so I can view it remotely in a matter of seconds. Great support and great product. 
12865 4 Can wait to use it for our cruise! 
12866 3 Screws right into my X-Pro 1 without any hassle and stays there pretty tightly. Looks good with the black and it s pretty lightweight. Plus it s the only soft button I ve had so far that hasn t fallen off! 
12867 3 Awesome! 
12868 4 Danny was ERY fast and helpful in the resolution of a probelm 
12869 0 It did not work. The screen was completely white. 
12870 4 pleased with purchase. Just as expected. 
12871 1 its made ok. it absolutely does NOT work with my garmin virb elite even though they put it in the description! guess i got caught with the &#34;keyword&#34; type ad they use to get you on their page even though their product has nothing to do with your shopping needs. 
12872 4 Great quality, won t pick up trees if windy. Easy to set up, 5 minutes, batteries after three weeks, still full. Recommend if your looking for a nice security camera. 
12873 4 Very useful one. Shipping was fast. 
12874 3 This tripod is perfect for the price! Easy to use, great size and worth it. Product came in perfect, all parts work! 
12875 4 Great lens at the best price anywhere. 
12876 3 Nice kit wish there was a small thin piece of metal to protect the set screw from bezel damage but I Mac Gyvered a shim to do the job works great. 
12877 4 Holy crap this is AWESOME!!! Im telling ALL my photog friends. 
12878 4 Fantastic lens. Very sharp. 
12879 4 Fantastic!!!! 
12880 2 The bottom does not work. Just de remote control 
12881 4 Great product! 
12882 4 Daughter is happy she bought a camera could not find the battery I DID GOT TODAY. SHE IS ON CLOUD 9 THANKS 
12883 4 Great products delivered quickly. 
12884 4 ExFoto body and rear lens cap fit just right on the Sony A3000 (&#34;Sony&#34; and &#34;E Mount&#34; are stamped on both). Handy when using adapters. Product arrived in about two days...great service. I recommend this, no problems. 
12885 4 Works great with my utility PG&E! 
12886 4 All my gear fits well. Nice fit and finish. Good product 
12887 4 Price beat out the competition and product was as advertised. 
12888 4 My go-to glass when I tie smaller than size 14 flies. Nice warm light. 
12889 3 Great product... Used it and works magnificently. Reduced the amount of gear I sometimes travel with. Loving it. 
12890 4 Great to have. Never know when will be needed. 
12891 2 It feels pretty cheap. One came damaged but they sent a replacement. You have to be extremely delicate when adjusting camera if not you can mess up the threading in the screws. 
12892 4 I bought this unit when I purchased a new video camera. They work flawlessly. 
12893 3 It has better resolution than the previous generation, but did not include any software for viewing multiple cameras, as in the past. 
12894 1 Macro lens is crap. I used wide angle lens only once and don t like to use anymore 
12895 3 Took a while to ship but it s exactly as described. 
12896 3 Does what it says 
12897 4 Amazingly thought and easy to apply. Great product! 
12898 4 Material is very sturdy, with very tight connections. 
12899 4 Love it, motion detector work amazing!!! wifi, free cloud! easy to use. Glad I got this! I use this in my room when I leave, I just plug it in when I leave and unplug when I get home. 
12900 3 Love it. Bought this as a gift for a friend and you can clearly see the difference in the pictures. Would recommend this and the price is right. 
12901 4 We bought this when we had a baby. Takes amazing portrait photos at a reasonable cost. 
12902 4 Came in the mail fast. I only use my polaroid for special occasions and if you do the same, then I wouldn t suggest buying such a large packet because these expire and photos don t come out as great. This is a great deal though. 
12903 4 These work great. Not one problem 
12904 3 It is a very nice bracket. This is the only item that I have ordered from Foscam that I haven t had to send back for replacement. 
12905 4 Suitable quality for the price. Met description and accurately performs on my daughter`s iPhone 5S. Would recommend purchase to others. 
12906 0 My bouancy mount just crumbled in my hands after less than a month of light use. What gives? This is after the screw for one of the mounts disappearing in the ocean. I m dumbfounded. 
12907 4 Outstanding value for the price. You get 2 Vivitar batteries for the price of 1 and the charger and cleaning kit. Vivitar has made quality photography equipment for decades. 
12908 0 Wonderful toy, if it just worked how it supposed to. It doesn t matter how much i correct or &#34;calibrate&#34; it with the correction buttons in the remote, it just keep going front or aside, i almost lost it to the ocean 2 times!!! 
12909 4 This mount was slim enough to allow proper focusing on all my cctv lenses. It does what it advertises well. 
12910 0 Not sure have not got it to work yet. I will repost later. 
12911 4 As advertised and good price 
12912 4 Love the versatility with the 5 different colors and hues. Easily folds down (once you ve practiced a few times lol). 
12913 3 very good camera, but very temperamental. One should double check shots before relying on the evf focus or otherwise. 
12914 4 I use these Filmguard bags to keep my cellphone in when I travel. While the chances of damage are remote, these bags are used to protect some of my electronic devices. 
12915 4 Fits my old Cannon Eos RebelG yeah thats a 35mm. 
12916 3 So far, so good. 
12917 4 Perfect...!!! 
12918 4 Repeat customer. Shipped fast, great product. Chargers my Canon rebel camera just as well as the original battey! Thx! 
12919 4 As described. Quick ship. 
12920 4 Perfect! 
12921 4 It s a wonderful product. the night and day vision is very clear. Had no problems installing although had to ask for help with putting it in the right spot. We be ordering more of this item 
12922 4 Works great. Best one I ve used in this type of head 
12923 2 Does not record video from my quad copter cam. 
12924 4 awesome yo. 
12925 4 arrived fast easy to install 
12926 3 Easy to use, great price. 
12927 3 Perfect fit for my Sony camera. 
12928 4 Great camera, everything works great and the international delivery service was quite fast. Tnx for a good deal. 
12929 4 This camera takes great pics in and out of water. We took it on vacation to Punta Cana and were very pleased with the quality of the pictures. 
12930 4 Very happy with the kit. 
12931 4 I like the dual settings and it fits perfectly on your strap. 
12932 4 AAAA++++ 
12933 3 Great price to give as a gift to a young graduate. 
12934 4 I love this camera. Great pictures and options. Can use AA batteries instead of having to keep it charged. The wireless share option is absolutely awesome - it instantly will send them to my phone or tablet for sharing and uploading. No cords to worry about. 
12935 4 They thought of everything, most complete kit I have ever seen, amazing product. Very useful. 
12936 3 Seemed to work well for calibration, but started bugging me to recalibrate about two weeks later and I can t get it to stop. 
12937 2 not working great. hard to set up. returned and bought other camera 
12938 4 good 
12939 0 Not made strong 
12940 4 Works well as a replacement for a storage card reader. 
12941 3 Sorta big but it works 
12942 4 Great Item! Would buy again. Did not disappoint. 
12943 4 Tons of space, extremely comfortable, great value. Looks and feels like it should cost a lot more than it did. It has so much space, I don t even have enough stuff to put in there :) 
12944 4 Well built, smooth action, no faults so far. This head is more useful to me than a ball head. Handle is on the left side, right hand is free to hit shutter or change settings 
12945 4 Rhis was amazing! Way better than i expected. Durable vinyl. Greaaaaat color. Loved it and will use it for many years to come 
12946 4 So many different levels it can be placed on. Great tool 
12947 4 Great addition to my amateur photography case. 
12948 1 Cumbersome, not useful. 
12949 3 Don t try to tighten these suckers even slightly with your fingers! I did. And there was no way I could untighten them by hand! The lens binds! I actually had to take a pair of waterpump pliers to the filter to get it off. Just saying! 
12950 4 Whats to say? It works. 
12951 2 nice product, quick delivered, good description 
12952 4 They fit the screen of my a5100 perfectly. 
12953 4 Excellent product! Used it on MacBooks, Acer s, Lenovos. Makes all the difference in the world when running. On the MacBook, the fans don t turn on as soon as they would before, and it definitely runs cooler. 
12954 3 It is okay little too heavy but not try to look at the moon yet Wait until next trip to Asia. 
12955 4 Good, sturdy little tripod for the right application. Just keep in mind the size, and if it fits your needs, you ll like it. 
12956 4 Works perfectly with the strap. 
12957 4 Finally a cup that stays on in my bag. 
12958 4 Fast service! Love the product! 
12959 4 I wish the directions were a little clearer on how you know when it is fully charged and when its on verses off. 
12960 3 Seems to work pretty well, a bit faster than in camera charging. It does get a bit warm, but that hasn t been a problem so far. The batteries seem to hold a charge about the same as the Sony branded options, time will tell if they last as long. 
12961 4 Got as birthday gift for wife, and she loves it. Pictures are beautiful and it brings back the nostalgia of the insta pic camera. 
12962 4 according to expectations, very good article 
12963 4 A must have for action sports! 
12964 3 It has a pretty decent quality, great camera to take on a short trip, hiking or biking. No complaints. My only complaint is that it does not come with a memory card. The price is right and the quality is better than I expected. 
12965 4 The Lefun video camera was very difficult to activate to my IPhone but upon getting it done, it is a fantastic device. It met all expectations and was a great addition to the overall security of my residence. I am very pleased. 
12966 4 love it!! 
12967 3 Just what I needed and a price that I was very happy with 
12968 4 Very pleased with the camera and it s features from night vision to mobile device notification. I recommend this camera to anyone that is looking for a good security camera. 
12969 4 Great deal! 
12970 4 This bag is so cute!! High quality, perfectly fits the Fuji. Sturdy also! 
12971 4 Charged up fine and works well. 
12972 4 Fits on my T5i 
12973 4 It is good product. I spend a lot of time to find it. 
12974 2 Screws keeps coming loose and the Gopro adapter correctly. Otherwise it is ok for a starter clamp. 
12975 4 Amazing camera delivered quickly. 
12976 4 Awesome and cheap! Good thing i found this 
12977 4 Exactly what I was looking for for my GoPro!! Highly satisfied!!!! 
12978 4 This case is great! Fit everything I needed in it. 
12979 3 Works great. Just wish it had an off switch. 
12980 3 very nice 
12981 4 Product delivery and performance as advertised. Would recommend to friend. 
12982 4 Received in great condition. Packaged appropriately. Charged just fine. But have not been able to use as both camera shipments arrived damaged and were returned. 
12983 4 Can you use this for fishing in a boat? 
12984 4 very satisfied fast delivery would recommend ,charges fast 
12985 4 Love this cam and use it as a dash cam every day. 
12986 0 Was good till it rained. Camera maybe outdoor but not the poe connection. 
12987 1 The quality of picture is poor at best 
12988 2 Cool 
12989 0 AWFUL! Save your money. The software wouldn t download, making it completely useless. 
12990 4 A+++++ 
12991 4 great floats to save my electronics. I had 1 from before and had to order this set of 2 because they are so great. 
12992 4 Great quality for good price! Came really fast even though i chose free shipping! 
12993 4 Received product and tried installing it myself. Had a problem with the play back Called D-Link customer service and received excellent assistance from Employee id# AR004619 
12994 3 Didn t like the way the vivitar lens hood fit so I got a genuine cannon lens hood 
12995 4 Great lens for my Canon t3i, price was right. I like it! 
12996 4 Haven t lost a camera yet. 
12997 4 Best camera in the world!!!!!!!!!!!)))))) 
12998 4 This is a great product. See the video about it on the B&H site. 
12999 4 Good product and fast delivery. Just as expected. 
13000 4 Nice Camera and not complicated to operate. 
13001 4 Not bad at all. The Sony battery I m using can be a pain to pull out, but besides that, the light wouks great and can be VERY bright. 
13002 4 Great purchase, very usable for the batteries of our Panasonic Camera. 
13003 4 Looks very realistic, good quality and arrived on time. 
13004 4 Well, there is a ton of stuff in this kit. I hope my wife figures out what all of it is for. Super fast service, all packaged real well. Exactly as advertised. 
13005 4 Camera take great videos. Came with lots o accessories. Waterproof case works great. Great camera for the price. You can click on the links below to view sample videos. Sample Video @ 1080p/60fps daytime: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpDS_aVjA5Q https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZ4A19GoEFk Sample Video @ 1080p/60fps at night https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UQICoPTPlw 
13006 4 the lenses are great, though I rarely use the 15mm the filters are amazing!! you can even use the blue filter on the moon and the resulting image will not be too affected color-wise, where are if you use the moon filter you get a green moon. 
13007 3 I am very happy with it s calibration results, but the software is OK. Calibration takes a while, and the software could be a bit more powerful. I bought this hoping that I could accurately change color temperature throughout the day, but it s not an easy process. 
13008 4 The light is dim, but good enough to provide a little light to highlight our front columns. 
13009 4 Great Product just what I was looking for. Easy to set up. I also like the fact I can receive photos on my cell. 
13010 3 Arrived on time. Exactly as expected. 
13011 4 I am having a lot of fun getting to know my new camera. It takes incredible pictures. I only wish I could go on vacation to all the scenic places to take pictures. 
13012 3 It s fun. Make sure lighting is good when you take pic. If they are pics will be nice. Took it to a wedding. Fun. I give it 4.5 stars 
13013 4 Great I Love It 
13014 1 POOR DEPTH OF FIELD. PICTURES WERE NOT SHARP. OVERALL HAD BETTER PICS WITH LOWER PRICED CAMERS, ESPECIALLY NIKONS AND THE KINDLE FIRE HD. 
13015 4 Such a great price!! You would be crazy not to buy!!! Just got it in the mail today and everything is perfect!! I can t put my camera down! I have a Nikon d7100 and the auto focus with the lens works wonderfully! Thank youuuuuu! :) 
13016 4 Convenient and fits perfectly. Quality plastic cases for photo batteries. 
13017 3 very niice 
13018 4 This is a really nice camera strap. I replaced my Nikon strap with this one and have not had any neck ache from the strap cutting into the back of my neck. Good material, nice looking and easy to detach from camera. 
13019 4 Came with everything stated and in great shape. A really good value given the price. 
13020 3 very useful item! everything was ok, recommended! 
13021 2 Rough machining; not smooth when adjusting. 
13022 0 My camera stopped working the minute I plugged this in!!!! 
13023 4 They look real! Installed all 4 in 30 minutes. My handyman saw them and said, &#34;Good for you, you have a security system.&#34; I did tell him the truth😊 
13024 4 Spend the money on this and you will be glad you did. Works awesome, stinks really well without damaging. 
13025 4 Good 
13026 0 not good at all 
13027 4 Original and perfect! 
13028 4 Easy, fast, safe and confortable! 
13029 3 The item works as advertised. The only downside I have found so far is it does not fit as well as the original lens cap did. It does, however, fit well enough to keep dirt, water, etc off of the lens. 
13030 4 I wondered if I would like this since it is an off-brand, but so far the batteries last just as long as my Fuji batteries, so I have no complaints. Good price on a good product! 
13031 4 Batteries work fine in my Canon Powershot Elph 520HS. Received in a timely manner. Thank you! AAA+++ 
13032 3 ALL WENT WELL 
13033 4 Delivered quickly, quality product. Easy to use. Thanks! 
13034 3 I ve been able to calibrate all of my lenses with ease. 
13035 4 Awesome, Beautiful piece 
13036 4 Great buy, very happy. Easy set up 
13037 4 Worked to perfection. 
13038 3 The only reason I m not giving this a 5 star rating is the cheaply-constructed plastic ring adapter that comes with it. 
13039 4 Works great 
13040 4 Works great. 
13041 4 Ok 
13042 3 Awesome 
13043 3 I needed to file down the base that slips into the camera s hot shoe so it fit better (the paint made it just a bit too big to easily fit), otherwise it works great! I highly recommend this adaptor for devices like Sony s HDR-AZ1. 
13044 3 This works if it is trying to hold up just the camera. If you have any other accessories on it though, it doesn t seem to work so well. The bright orange does help find it in the water though. 
13045 4 Looks very realistic and if you can keep it in the sun the charging works well. 
13046 4 the pics of my husband in tis think was worth every cent 
13047 4 it is a very good polarizer at a good price. Recommended 
13048 4 Just like the ones that came with my Go Pro. 
13049 4 Fast shipping and quality product. 
13050 4 Great camera! 
13051 4 I didn t know how much I wanted this tripod until I used it ..fantastic! DSLR no problem. 
13052 3 Good. 
13053 4 Fast shipping, product work s as advertised. Great value I highly recommend! 
13054 4 very good picture 
13055 4 Worked fine 
13056 4 AS usual, a great filter. 
13057 3 Works, but be sure to rinse thoroughly after saltwater use as it uses cheap screws which will rust in no time. 
13058 4 Nice case 
13059 3 Product works fine (my second set). Inexpensive &#34;fix&#34; If you are going to get serious about using your GoPro, the higher end filter solutions will be better for you, but these do work as described, though short lived if handled often. 
13060 0 The fit is so far off the batter fails to make contact when this device is screwed onto the A6000 
13061 4 Great for getting those difficult angles. 
13062 4 keeps charge almost the same as original and price is awesome. will see how long will keep capacity. will buy it again. 
13063 1 None of the pictures develop , I went to Michael s and bought more film to see if it was my camera ,but all the film from Micheal s worked. None of these developed. 
13064 4 Super fast charger and two batteries for less than the price of the batteries. Amazing. 
13065 4 Using these batteries with my FujiFilm X100T camera as extra backups - they work like a charm, seem to be well made, charge reasonably fast, no issues with size. 
13066 4 Nice product. Will order one more right now. Great for dslr attachement and slider set up. 5stars Please check out our youtube channel PassionForDrive 
13067 4 Other than lockjaw because the weight of the camera I can t complain. Steve has great customer service and will take care of you if there is an issue. I highly recommend for those that want first person view while surfing! 
13068 4 Takes great pictures, easy to use. Great for telephoto shots. Have taken it 4 wheeling and no problem with camera being bounced around. 
13069 4 worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks. 
13070 0 Both units arrived DOA. No functions worked, not even flash test. Tried several Nikon flashes - all the same. Best thinks I can say is that I got a prompt no hassle refund. 
13071 4 Well made, excellent size. 
13072 4 very pleased 
13073 2 Used a light meter, this doesn t put out nearly as much as it claims too. False advertisement. 
13074 3 Works fine. 
13075 4 For the price, you can t beat this ball head with a stick! I own two of them. 
13076 4 great! 
13077 4 Have 0 complaints for the price. Mostly plastic with main bars, etc being aluminum. but again, it does what it s designed to do and is a very solid product. 
13078 0 This does not fit a Nikon P500 even though it s listed. 
13079 4 Item delivered on time, was as described, 
13080 4 Very Good!!!!♡♡♡♡ 
13081 4 Works perfectly! 
13082 3 They fit and do the job, although they seem to have less capacity than the Fuji batteries. On the plus side, the included charger is much more compact than the one that came with the camera. 
13083 4 I use this tripod in my studio and on location. Holds the 7-200L with ease. Love the grips for control. Buy it 
13084 4 For the price this is an excellent home camera. The ease of which it sets up is what I particularly like about the product. I would recommend this to a friend. 
13085 3 I love it. it works wonderfully with my Canon 5D MK3. Heavy duty construction. 4 stars because I think it s overpriced. Should be a $29.99 item. 
13086 4 Arrived quickly. Surprisingly good for moon and star gazing! 
13087 0 does not contain the circlip, not be able to repair ,the image does not correspond to the product 
13088 4 This is a very low cost solution for document camera needs. We use this in a school setting. It is very easy to store and to share among several teachers because the set up is so easy. 
13089 1 Great camera but very slow in reporting, sometimes none at all 
13090 4 perfect 
13091 3 Still have not used, but looks good 
13092 2 Great camera. The fact that you can control it with your phone is amazing. It s just the quality of the image that is a bit disaponting. But other than that it s a great camera 
13093 4 It floats! I took this on vacation and it worked great to store my cash in, clip it to my bathing suit or whatever! Very good quality! 
13094 3 Works great easy set except I can t get internet connection to the Internet no usb connect screen reads. 
13095 0 It was a plastic globe with purposely large drilled holes all around the base of it but packaged in a profoto box. Didn t seem legit. 
13096 4 Good kit, these accessories are just like the go pro ones, the only difference is they are lacking the name, and thankfully the elevated price tag. Good Stuff! 
13097 4 I have tried everything under the sun to clean my lcd/led tvs. This stuff is amazing!!! I will be purchasing another bottle as a back up!! 
13098 3 The lens protector is a must with this frame when not in use. The frame bends easily to get the camera in and out. 
13099 4 Works perfectly with the lens specified. Good deal. 
13100 4 These along with the ones that are 90 degrees lets you make any angle you can imagine. They do fit tight and hold well. 
13101 4 Great product. Effortless to do business with 
13102 4 Everything I hoped for!! Excellent pictures!! 
13103 4 Good product. 
13104 4 Photo quality a little less than anticipated. However, great value. Easy to configure. Has worked flawlessly. 
13105 4 Works wonderfully. 
13106 4 This product was easy to use and the pictures looked nice. You can put hundreds of pictures on this device with an 8gb card. There are many options for display and will play music as well. I plan on buying another for myself! 
13107 4 Works perfectly and for much less than the Panasonic version.. 
13108 2 This product is strong, but the shoulder pad constantly slides out of position. 
13109 3 No performance issues.....this link process my photos directly to my computer without any issues. 
13110 4 Very nice album for the price. I wanted this to put all my daughter s senior proofs in and this album more than met my expectations 
13111 4 Great screen protector! Must have for D750. Fits perfectly. 
13112 4 Charges fast. Charger was my main interest as I had buggerred up the charger input on the camera and the batteries were a bonus. 
13113 4 Amazing! Love it! 
13114 4 Good 
13115 4 Worth the price 
13116 4 Great case. 
13117 4 Very good 
13118 0 Not good at all! Never had Wi-Fi , you suck! 
13119 4 Original equipment that fits like it should! 
13120 4 Bought this for my daughter who was going on a cruise. She loves this camera and found it easy to use. 
13121 4 Excellent 
13122 4 Kept my camera dry during a rained out wedding. It was a total lifesaver. Worth the very low price I paid to keep my very high priced camera safe. 
13123 4 Awesome item for the graphic artist or others wanting to showcase materials in a clean and professional manner - many extra pages that other portfolios don t have at a great price! 
13124 3 It came with a ton of stuff. Something you deffenitly have to mess around with and get used to. Ober all very good product and it shipped fast. 
13125 4 every thing ok 
13126 4 Great bag, just the right size. Excellent value. 
13127 4 The very refined product fits my monopod perfectly. 
13128 0 This product freaking sucks! We have now had it for two and a half months, and it just QUIT WORKING! And Amazon won t let me return it, I am pissed! 
13129 4 Powers my 7&#34; Lilliput monitor from my RED Brick. Works great. 
13130 3 This serves the intended purpose- blocking excess light so that I can better see the viewfinder display. It does, however, block some of the rear screen. Debating about trimming it a bit. 
13131 4 really good camcorder 
13132 2 A little bit small 
13133 4 Much sturdier than the cable that initially came with the camera! 
13134 3 takes good pictures 
13135 0 Poor connection that requires the camera to be turned on before the lens is seated. This is too expensive for the build quality. 
13136 4 good to have a spare 
13137 4 Wanted wireless one. So returned this one. Got to order a wireless one. 
13138 4 Ths is a very well-made camera. The metal housing is lightweight yet very sturdy. The finish on the base metal is very nice and high quality.The color and contrast on this camera is very good. I would buy another one if the need arises. 
13139 4 Very dorobale 
13140 4 fast shipping, awesome price! 
13141 4 works great in my camera 
13142 4 Excellent camcorder, I have really enjoy to film with. Very stable image and clear sound. If you are looking for a good camera at perfect price, this is the one for you! 
13143 4 i love my new camera strap its so pretty and really nice fabric defiantly 5 stars 
13144 3 Nice, but loosens up in the water and came off during scuba dive. 
13145 0 Battery would hold enough charge to power the camera for 3 minutes. From first charge, this new battery would not hold a charge. Warning! Avoid! Pour quality. 
13146 1 Second-rate optics in a nice compact and light binocular. Lost it and bought a Pentax 9 X 28 for $180. Really nice. 
13147 4 Paper is good quality and color. Thickness was enough to hold up to taping and walking on. The pictures we took against this look fantastic! I highly recommend buying. 
13148 4 I put these on every lens I own, it protects your lens and with not really much of a reduction in picture quality. Worth the investment better to replace a filter then lens. 
13149 4 They fit just fine! 
13150 0 Junk! waste of time and money! Don t buy it! 
13151 4 Great quality. Perfect amount of storage. Take it on all my hikes. Rugged, did I mention QUALITY. 
13152 4 This is a really collection of things for my camera. It more than met my needs. 
13153 4 Adapter was shipped very quickly. I like it better than another PC hot shoe adapter that I used to use. TTL pass through works great and is not obstructed by the hot shoe. 
13154 4 Perfect 
13155 4 worked just fine 
13156 4 good quality 
13157 0 bad 
13158 0 I purchased the older model a few years back and it worked great! The new model works but is fuzzy and hangs on shutdown! I would not recommend. Instead of getting better it is far worse! If you can get dvu104 it works very well! 
13159 4 perfect spare batteries for the go pro, includes charger 
13160 0 Other than it breaking 2 days after getting it, it s great. I wish I could leave negative stars. Biggest piece of crap. Poorly made. 
13161 4 Minor hiccup at first when updating firmware for the first time, but once that s complete you won t regret. 
13162 4 I found the matching tripod for this piece at a Goodwill for $10 but it didn t have the quick release. This piece fits perfectly and it is very easy to remove and out back on the tripod. I m very happy with it. 
13163 2 Not really practical for shirt pocket, but picture is decent and battery life is as advertised. 
13164 2 It works great, takes awesome picutres and is very easy to get to record when mounted. However, the user interface with the phone app is really not intuitive and sometimes Finding harnesses and acessories are harder than other more popular cameras. 
13165 4 It s perfect I am very pleased with it. 
13166 0 I got the incorrect brand for my camera, loot at the details first before you purchase it. 
13167 2 Battery discharges extremely fast and overheats the camera causing it to shut down way to easily. 
13168 3 A little pricey but does what it is supposed to. 
13169 4 Just what I wanted and a good price. 
13170 4 Exact fit. Long life. Travel charger great to have on a long vacation. Never had to worry about a dead battery at the beach or at the wedding. Charging in the car is a great feature. 
13171 1 I bought two. Neither worked with motion video. Single pictures worked fine. Continuous video worked fine. 
13172 4 for being a off brand/knock off it holds really well against the true gopro battery. love that it s a wall charger and can double as a car charger too. 
13173 4 I ve used these for a couple of years- they take and hold charges well, and I ve changed them about every 2 years. 
13174 4 If you have a GoPro, just get this. Great price with a greet charger and you ll need the batteries. 
13175 4 Thourghly enjoing this lense 
13176 3 So far so good. Everything was there and more than I will probably ever need 
13177 3 Performed as expected. Still have not used all the accessories. Update. The headstrap works great better than the GoPro model for me.Have not used all the accessories, only those related to diving at present. 
13178 2 Seals well but buttons very hard to push, unlike original. would not buy again 
13179 2 It s okay should have done more homework before purchase. Do not like paddle flipping to one side. I find it difficult following anything I want to capture with paddle to one side. Just okay. Thank you 
13180 2 I have no experience with a proper wide angle lens but this one was a fantastic low budget solution to my dilemma 
13181 2 it did work for alittle bit,,you get what u pay for..lol 
13182 3 Love it. Bought two. May get a third. Can check on my elderly dog during the day. 
13183 4 Great for the lake and other dirty/dusty/wet locations. We have dropped it in the water several times with no negative results. Great for candid shots. 
13184 4 Sent this as a gift and the recipient loves it!! If has everything needed for a person who is traveling and hates to carry bulky accessories. 
13185 0 I wouldn t recommend buying this, the tripod is plastic, and one of the legs broke! Not very sturdy and it came to me all scratched up and rusty! 
13186 4 As advertised 
13187 3 Got the Sidekick Black Duo. Powerful light that attaches to the gopro via a long screw that holds at the pivot point. Great accessory. It s a bit too bright for close up but it does light up subject nicely overall. Great product. 
13188 3 Very useful 
13189 4 A great camera for the price. Wifi Picture downloads is very convenient, All user friendly controls and video quality is excellent. 
13190 3 its a X mass gift so have not used but looks like its a nice item ...... 
13191 4 Such a great camera for only $45. It does the job as expected. Super clear video quality and great night vision. Highly recommend it. 
13192 4 For the money.....excellent. I have high dollar lenses, and this glass performs as expected and exceeds expectations. Really fun to use. 
13193 4 Great item 
13194 3 Works ok. 
13195 4 My mom loves this bag, great size! 
13196 4 EXCELENT PRODUCT CLEAR VIEW 
13197 4 way too cool 
13198 4 Two thumb up 
13199 4 For a beginner you will be on overload with all the accessories. My daughter has a similar camera, she is helping teach me. Everything but, large tripod fits in case, but, full! I use another bag to carry my camera, most times. 
13200 4 Good 
13201 3 I am very happy with this lens. Did not have any kind of problem. Nice Bokeh in my pictures. I have been using with TC 1.4 
13202 4 So far so good. Great pictures. Thanks for a great product. 
13203 2 It works, but charger is a pain. It is an adjustable , universal charger. You will have to look up the positive and negative contact with the battery manufacturer (there are many contacts on these batteries!) just to see how to setup the charger. 
13204 2 Great bag, just needs a little more room. 
13205 0 Didn t fit. Didn t work. Didn t charge. 
13206 4 Oh how it makes me feel young again. The Polaroid, which instantly develops and prints out your photo within 15 minutes. I love using it but why it gotta be so expensive to get the film :( Can t mess up with this camera! :) Great quality, LOVE IT! 
13207 4 Great value. It works as advertised. Only thing that has me worried is how tight the included mount squeezes my iPhone 6 Plus. I may buy a different phone mount, but even doing so this is still a great value. 
13208 4 Excellent quality and easy to use! 
13209 4 Very comfy and secure strap. Well worth the purchase. 
13210 4 Great product and arrived on time 
13211 4 Fits my camer like a glove. 
13212 4 I took this home & attached to my camera & works great. What a find. My 200mm didn t go as far as I wanted, for our trips. VR works great as well. 
13213 1 The batteries are great, but the grip doesn t seat correctly. I loose power to the camera and have to reconnect the grip to get it to work. 
13214 4 Great camera easy to use. Beautiful 
13215 2 Construction/materials seems kind of cheap. I d pay more for something a little sturdier. 
13216 4 The item itself is really nice, it fit my crossshot strap well but the 2 is too small for my galaxy S5, It is good quality enought that I will order the Joey 3 since this wasn t useful for what I needed 
13217 4 does what is says 
13218 4 Basic film. Always good 
13219 4 Love this camera, makes cute business card size pictures. 
13220 4 Great Kit 
13221 4 Luv it. 
13222 0 Then Vivitar Auto Focus teleconverter lens would not operate on auto focus. I had to manually focus to obtain an image. I m very displeased with this purchase and when I return home later this week I will be requesting another one that works. 
13223 3 Lots of pictures of my hand due to lens placement. Underwater worked and underwater color was good. 
13224 4 Great little monitor, works really well with my A7S and the smallhd support team has been amazing! The 1080p panel has super high resolution which makes it simple to pull focus. 
13225 0 The product do not work well. First the stop sign I thought would have been a little bigger. And it want light up when the car touch the pole. It will light up way seconds later. I really not satisfied with the product. 
13226 4 THIS CAMERA IS GREAT. AND THANKS FOR THE REVIEWER S DISCOUNT. 
13227 4 this lens will change the way you see photography. It s pricey, but the quality come with a price. If you have the money please buy it. 
13228 4 Great battery at an affordable price 
13229 4 It was as advertised and arrived in good time. 
13230 2 Worthwhile if you find a bargain. Batteries hold up well. Motion sensors delay causes people to be out of the frame before recording. About a 1-2 sec delay. Numerous false alarms and yet has hard time recognizing people in vicinity. 
13231 4 Great Product, Fast shipping 
13232 2 This product works however you gotta watch the pin to make sure it doesn t come out. By pin I m talking about when you will see that I m pointing towards in the product picture. 
13233 4 Great camera! Worth it. 
13234 4 This product is awesome. I love it 
13235 3 It didn t fit my light setup but with a little modifying it worked out. Fun product. 
13236 4 Had to read the reviews to find out how it attached, but it works great. I don t ever remember owning a lens that required the removal of a piece of trim to attach a hood. 
13237 4 Great product.Would buy again. Expensive but worth it. Well built. 
13238 4 Arrival time as said Going to have so much fun for my birthday &#60;3 
13239 4 Every positive review is spot on! Love this thing! 
13240 4 still working 
13241 4 I m completely happy with the product. 
13242 4 Awesome 
13243 4 Great camera fast delivery very happy 
13244 1 I asked for the Kodak MD863 charging cord and adaptewr but was send one that did fit the charging plug on the camera. I hope we can resolved. 
13245 0 Horrible. I didnt even get a chance to get it wet. Thr screen stopped working and the battery died within 15 minutes. Now i have no pics of my event 
13246 4 Henry was very helpful getting my camera set up, foscam underestimates wait times on the phone but that is IT for you. An hour later I cannot connect to my camera, it says incorrect username/password 
13247 1 Battery Door does not fit properly. Adding tape to hold in place. Must snap door on and add tape each time battery is removed. 
13248 4 works great 
13249 3 Well pachaged and arrived very quickly. They charged up well and seem to be working just fine 
13250 3 I bought this for my Tamron AF18-270mm f/3.5-6.3 lens. Primary purpose is to use it as a protection to the front element of the lens. Very pleased with the quick shipment. 
13251 2 Neither great nor bad. Mounting hardware is cheap and flimsy. Camera works okay. 
13252 4 Great quality! 
13253 4 This bag has worked beautifully for our needs! 
13254 4 Delivered as indicated and works well on my camera. Great value. 
13255 4 Perfect! 
13256 3 great tool for knowing who s comming in your house. 
13257 4 Fits my Canon 85mm well. Attaches and detatches easily. Fast and efficient service and great item for a great deal. Thank you. 
13258 0 It was weak and break easy 
13259 0 Was NOT the color I ordered. I wanted raspberry, received a very dull, red camera instead. Very disappointed 
13260 2 Not bad. You probably don t want this if you take it places as it ll get banged up quick. But fine for a stable studio environment, and fine for the price. 
13261 4 Great item, good price!! I really liked the product! 
13262 3 Good system, easy to set up, works good, does good in the dark 
13263 3 Took a long time to get them but they are exactly what I wanted! 
13264 4 Amazing bundle! Great kit for the money. 
13265 3 It s amazing...as far as a 1000 m range when used as a momentary switch, the relay can chatter at 3 m if you stand between the devices. 
13266 4 Despite so many half assed reviews that sorta bash this camera, I found that it is leaps and bounds better than the original 7d that my neighbor has. The extra features are worth the extra money to spend on the mark 2 
13267 1 Grainy video. Can t see the difference between this and my old standard definition camera. I regret buying it. 
13268 4 Amazing system and easy to install! The camera views from the phone are real clear! You get plenty of cameras to place throughout the house. 
13269 3 Not much to talk about, it is ridiculously easy to install and sounds pretty good. 
13270 3 A battery is a battery, what more can be said. The ordering process was simple and it arrived on time. And I did order a second one. 
13271 2 Records really dope but Idk if it s my phone or the camera. But when i download the video too my phone I have no sound. 
13272 2 Case is soft not a hard case..price is right 
13273 4 Works great. Charges two batteries relatively quickly. Glad I bought it. 
13274 4 great accessory to have for the GoPro. really cool to see the point of view of your dog. adjustable for dog sizes 
13275 4 Used to replace Honda Accord original alarm horn. Works great. 
13276 0 Didn t fit. 
13277 4 Moose always delivers. Love this circular polarizer. It is my second size and every time I get a lens, I will return to get one in the new size needed. 
13278 4 bought this for my wife as a birthday gift as she was getting ready for a mission trip to Monterrey. Not only is it a good camera but as a tablet she used it to keep me informed of her trip via e-mail. 
13279 4 great product 
13280 4 Love it. Works great with my Olympus E420. Easy set up and works with AAA batteries, which were provided for both units. 
13281 4 I got this for my daughter s birthday and she loves it. I bought the accessories but she wants to get more. I ll leave it up to her to get the extras. 
13282 3 Maybe it s great product, but it s not that easy to use. 
13283 4 Super cute bag that matches surprisingly well with the Fuji Instamax raspberry colored camera! The material is really soft and the case opens 3 different ways so you can snap a picture on the go. Overall great case! 
13284 3 Very good! 
13285 3 Exactly what I expected 
13286 4 The charger and batteries work fine. I received them quickly and put them to use immediately. I had occasion to use the batteries and charger extensively on a recent vacation and they performed well. 
13287 4 Lots of options, could have lived with 1/2 of them for what I do. But nice that they are there if I do need them. 
13288 4 Works. Paired with my YN560-II flash (with built in reciever). 
13289 4 Perfect and battery works great in my samsung camera 
13290 0 Its advertised as new, the product is not and wont hold charge 
13291 4 Works just fine. 
13292 4 This one is a bit shorter than the original that came with the lens, but that is not a problem. It screws on much more snuggly than the original, so I m hoping this one won t fall off and be lost! 
13293 4 So glad I saw this before laying out $160 more for the Really Right Stuff version! 
13294 4 Great product. If you are not tech savory you will need to get support. Online support is great. 
13295 4 good 
13296 4 Good price for a quality pod. I use vortex for all my scopes binos and spotter 
13297 4 Finally a battery charger that actually works for my model of Sony handycam. Ty Ty Ty. 
13298 2 Not bad for a small camera. 
13299 4 works on the Nikon lens that it was manufactured to fit. Mine was busted so I purchased the replacement. 
13300 0 Doesn t fit any canons 
13301 4 excellent 
13302 4 The photos speak for themselves. An outstanding camera. 
13303 4 The camera cleaning kit that was purchased arrived promptly and is exactly what I want. 
13304 2 not as good of quality as I would like, but for the price it s alright. 
13305 4 Good price and long lasting. 
13306 4 PERFECT!! 
13307 0 The documentation is in unintelligible English. Product support is non-existent. Returned. 
13308 1 Worked for the first day and then sensor wouldn t recognize motion. Not a good product. 
13309 4 Compact, great pictures, simple to use, good value for money. 
13310 3 Quick and as described 
13311 4 I like the fact that the charges has a plug right on it rather than having to lug the electrical cord around as is the case in the original charger. 
13312 0 BUYER BEWARE... Both zipper pulls from main compartment broke off in less than 3 months... the shoulder strap also broke in half. This case have only been used lightly since I bought it... I guess you get what you pay for. 
13313 4 it´s my second MegaGear, i have one for my G16, and love it. 
13314 3 Inexpensive way to get macro effects. Works best on 3rd objects (e.g. bugs, flowers, etc.) Not good for magnifying flat surfaces due to edge effects. 
13315 4 Bought this for my daughter s GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition. It worked great and made using the GoPro a breeze. We used it in and out of the water. 
13316 1 item simply did not work 
13317 3 useful good condition 
13318 4 It s takes really good pics. I was surprised. No problem with the camera. I use it underwater all the time. Great buy 
13319 2 Not always reliable but can usually get it operable after a bit of fussing. Serves its purpose for the price. 
13320 4 It works as expected. Since it is very inexpensive, and it comes in a pack of five, I don t mind putting new ones one as old ones break or fall off. So far so good, I have not had any failed on me yet. 
13321 2 It would be a better product if the batteries came in plastic carrying cases, such as Lumix batteries. This allows storage in camera bag without the contacts getting dirty. 
13322 4 I think it worked fine for the price, what do all the complainers want. 
13323 4 Excellent product! 
13324 4 Great bag, lots of compartments, just what I needed for a work bag. 
13325 4 Omg this is just what I expected an more ! Great conatruction , great materials ! Smooth and simple ! Amazing !!!! If you don t buy this as your first tripod you are just dumb ! 
13326 4 After I figured out how to work it, I can t complain about the camera, although the booklet that came with it was missing things so had to download it online. 
13327 4 Viviparous - the old standard at a great price. 
13328 0 The hight of the mount slide was too shallow for my GoPro Hero 3 clip and I could not insert the clip. Nice try but useless. 
13329 4 Love this lens! I use it for landscape and night sky photography. Yes, it is a little bulky and heavy but I feel that is a fair price to pay for the results that it can achieve. 
13330 0 Monitor had to be sent back to uniden for repair 1week after installation!!! Very disappointed and inconvenienced! Still haven t heard back from manufacturer! 
13331 4 Excelente 
13332 3 This lens works great, it is very light zoom is smooth. I recommend this lens 
13333 2 This product functions as designed and is definitely small and light but I d recommend getting the Jellyfish tripod instead. You ll be happier if you do. 
13334 4 Beautiful and has enough space for many things 
13335 1 The charge doesn t last very long, almost the same as the original Sony battery that I ve had for a few years - which is why I purchased new batteries. 
13336 4 Great 
13337 2 One of the leds doesn t work. Even thought the battery is fully charged (I ve charged them and switched them) One of the leds nevers turns on green. Besides that minor inconvenience the product works as described. 
13338 4 I m so pleased with the product and the speedily delivery! Great doing business with, I highly recommend! 
13339 4 Works very well and charges batteries quickly. Easy to use. 
13340 3 It s OK. 
13341 3 Now I just don t have to worry about not having a battery when I need it the most. 
13342 1 Cheap quality. If you are looking to save money go ahead. This mount will fall over and it will not stay in place when you wrap the legs around things. The camera is too heavy for the top ball it will slowly move and fall back. 
13343 4 works well 
13344 4 I liked the product 
13345 4 Price is right and comes with a 12v adapter as well. 
13346 4 Spectaculiar 
13347 3 Works great but would have liked some way to attach wrist/hand strap. It s still an excellent value. 
13348 4 Great picture quality at a very affordable price. Easily connected to my current ADT system. 
13349 3 This is such a great product! The camera is very easy to use and it has great pictures from it. When I was a child I always wanted a Polaroid camera and now I do. This is so much better than any other Polaroid camera. 
13350 3 Good product 
13351 4 Easy to use. Works great! It s much more convenient than using my smartphone app to take pics. Well worth the money. 
13352 0 I expected this pencil to be able to mark the back of photos. It does not. Was I incorrect in my expectation? 
13353 4 great backup battery. 
13354 2 No instructions or HDMI cable. 
13355 4 I had this camera for about a month now and it s awesome. I barely had problems with it, and it took great videos, photos, and more! 
13356 4 Works very good as expecyed 
13357 4 So far so good. 
13358 4 I love the color it s really lovely 
13359 4 These are great to keep up with camera in the water. I love the colors too! 
13360 3 It works just the way it supposed to be. 
13361 4 Perfect fit! 
13362 4 Perfect, was give the part info from Panasonic so I could find it on Amazon. It is just what I wanted and needed 
13363 4 Setting it up was easy because of the instructional videos you provided. I use this for filming videos. Seems like great quality and has a sturdy and solid build. 
13364 4 Package delivered on time, products such as described, all excellent, recommended 100%. 
13365 4 Great price and the filters work great! 
13366 4 Great case. Really fast shipping. Really easy to modify if you have made upgrades go your Phantom or controller. Very satisfied 
13367 4 good strap 
13368 4 Works where other cables don t. Long enough to avoid most issues. 
13369 4 works great in the night with no light and the sound is awesome. 
13370 4 It work wonderful, I really enjoy it. 
13371 4 I with I had one when I lost my gopro at the lake 
13372 4 great replacement strap 
13373 0 Super cheap plastic. Horrible video quality. Wasn t worth the $26 amazon prime day special. Returned it. 
13374 2 Had trouble with this product. It ended up not being compatible with my camera(Sony HDR-SR11) as advertised. However, the company I bought it from provided excellent customer service. I was able to return it. 
13375 4 Perfect fit. Access to the lock button when reversed. You wont be able to manual focus with it reversed though. 
13376 4 Works well in 2008 Honda CRV. 
13377 4 Very strong and durable. 
13378 4 It is excellent , it better and more power than regular Canon bsttery. Fast delivery. Thanks. 
13379 4 Very good accessory. Very solid, very good quality. Ideal for shooting at low altitude. The videos are fluids naturally no jumps or abrupt movements. The gripper has a non-slip protection, useful. I totally recommend. 
13380 4 Using this for cave photography/video very pleased with the results. 
13381 4 Used for sides of van 
13382 4 Very satisfied with purchase. 
13383 4 For the price, it is perfect for someone like me (a beginner) to mess around with some fun additions to my camera. 
13384 4 Snug fit on the lens and great protection to the lens. 
13385 4 Nice and sturdy piece of equipment. We mainly use it for our company s office pictures as well as pictures of our many field locations. Adjustable legs makes it pretty much suitable for any surface if you re willing to adjust the legs just right. 
13386 0 The camera never worked and a child was very dissappointed. Do not buy this camera. 
13387 2 It s a little too compact for the Lumix FX100 basic camera, and replacement battery. I need a larger case but the case is built great. 
13388 4 As expected 
13389 3 Good picture, too bad the lens scratch easily. Make sure you shake your camera underwater to get all the bubbles out before recording. Or another tip is to remove and reattach the filter while under water 
13390 4 This is good staf, now I can take photos for long time and many hours, it work with my Nikon D-5100 camera very well. 
13391 4 Great value, work as expected. Thanks! 
13392 4 excellent product. 
13393 4 A must have 
13394 4 Great product, would buy again. 
13395 4 It is great and really easy to use and the pictures a re good quality and clear. 
13396 4 Worked out great. 
13397 4 Excellent quality for a very low price! 
13398 4 Love this modern technical device for keeping an eye on the baby! This is a different generation of parents and they like to keep on top of the sleep schedule. This is an easy way to do it. Syncs with your cell phone. 
13399 4 Works very well & is easy to use 
13400 0 Very bad product. It show no value for money 
13401 3 The camera is wonderful,I really got what I wanted at a very great price 
13402 4 You just can t beat this deal! My batteries work perfectly, no problem shooting a full day of my son s baseball tournaments. I highly recommend product and seller. 
13403 4 Great deal! Love the dual charging ability. Thanks! 
13404 4 Took this on a trip to Africa. The worked great so far! 
13405 4 soft on the neck, and easy to put on the camera. 
13406 4 love it 
13407 4 Incredible prime lens. 
13408 4 It has a ton of features. I m just beginning to learn and try them out. It s fun! 
13409 4 bought this as a gift for my husband. It is a sweet case. It holds a lot of the accessories that we have for the go pro. very strong and durable 
13410 0 The one thing I slider is supposed to do is move left to right smoothly. Not only are there a lot of kinks in the move, it also wobbles forward and backwards along the track. 
13411 4 It worked as advertised. 
13412 0 Bought two. Each charged in less than 2 hours with Canon charger, but both were depleted of charge in 2 days. One with no use and the other used to take only 2 photographs. My rating would be a minus 5 stars. 
13413 4 Great replacement batteries for a good price. Have alwYs used Sarah I. 
13414 4 Excelente producto 
13415 4 What we needed - works great for camcorder and DSLR. 
13416 0 Not was explained.. Wasted money! 
13417 4 Walter did a great job assisting me and this is the 5th foscam camera I purchased and plan on purchasing more 
13418 4 I love this. It works great and arrived quickly 
13419 4 arrived fast and worked as I had planned. 
13420 2 I got the one before the session came out and the selfie stick sucks and the car mount broke once i touched it 
13421 4 Works well 
13422 3 Good 
13423 4 Got the camera used as a gift with Chatger. This one works just fine and charges fast! 
13424 4 Great camera, easy to use, and the movie capability captures good quality sound 
13425 4 Great, it works perfectly!!! 
13426 0 Extremely upset! Wish i could give it zero stars. I did not receive what was pictured. It was suppose to be film with rainbow borders instead they all have white borders. Will be returning. 
13427 4 I really do Like how straight forwardly useful this product is. I wish I had ordered it earlier. It s versatile and I can t find any fault. 
13428 4 Excellent Product 
13429 2 worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks. 
13430 4 Got two for remote locations and meeting my needs, excellent. 
13431 4 Good quality, very relaible 
13432 4 excelent , no problem 
13433 4 love the versatility 
13434 4 Awsome good 
13435 4 excellent fit and finish, works good. 
13436 3 Good product, Works as described haven t used it yet in the field cause ive been fighting my GoPro to update correctly but is sturdy built well and holds the GoPro very well. would recommend for somebody looking to either film live feed or charge for longer time lapse/video 
13437 4 No reason not to give 5 stars, the product charges batteries and the batteries run my gopro..cant be mad at that! 
13438 4 Great product and prompt shipment! Thanks!! 
13439 4 I ordered this just to see the quality and to hold two JTL light stands. I am extremely surprised at the quality and the protection it gives to my light stands. I will be ordering more of them as I order more light stands. 
13440 4 Very high quality archival storage pages. I m moving family slides out of carousels and into these to save space. 
13441 3 Looks like the TV is on from outside. Somebody must be home, right? 
13442 4 Worked Directly without doing anything.... Just inserted it into the USB port of my Surface Pro 3 and Windows Hello was ready to scan my fingerprints... 
13443 4 i loved the camera, its great thank you 
13444 4 Fantastic camera!! 
13445 4 Calvin did a wonderful job and was very fast! 
13446 4 Needed this for my Kodak camera, however I paid about $20-24 dollars about 2 years ago on here, which I thought was kind of pricey. It does get the job done though. 
13447 3 Like having as a practical spare 
13448 4 Carlos, did an excellent job helping me with my camera 
13449 2 The card makes it worthwhile but probably won t use most of the items. 
13450 4 Perfect 
13451 2 The package arrived much earlier than promised. Excellent! The buckle s quality has room for improvement. The hook got pulled sideways by 2 MM after a week s use. 
13452 4 Easy to use and works well 
13453 4 Perfect operation simple install! You know someone s out front before they do! Range football field not bad! 
13454 4 I just love the camera the pictures that come are excellent 
13455 3 I thought it will be other type of camera with more features but still good for my photography classes. 
13456 4 Good for the price .The first times the stick rotated sometime but after some time it got harder and holds well big phones. Still using a lot after several months. 
13457 4 Very sharp, relatively light, and the AF is quick enough for fast subjects. 
13458 4 Cheaper than buying one of the clock nanny cams.. Works great, easy to program when connected to your PC.. 
13459 3 Good Material only first time to open is a little bit hard. 
13460 4 Works great! 
13461 4 I love it :) 
13462 4 Cannot beat it for the price. Great little lens and FUN to shoot with it. VERY pleased with this purchase and even though it is a manual focus it is easy to work with. The manual focus actually helps you to become a better photographer. 
13463 1 Does not fit well 
13464 4 So far, everything works great. My son ordered a GoPro for our vacation. His has issues and their tech support has been very lacking. I ordered a GeekPro and started to test it on Thursday. The picture quality is excellent and no issues were noted. Thanks for your prompt shipment! 
13465 4 I was looking for something to fit my Sony RX100 iii and this is perfect. It s kind of tight for it but it s work and it can also fit into my pockets. I needed something sturdy in case of an impact and this seem strong enough for it. 
13466 4 NICE! 
13467 4 Exactly as stated 
13468 4 great seller - delivered as promised! 
13469 4 The video quality is great. Love the microphone option. We are using this as a baby monitor. 
13470 4 Very nice product. Easy to install. Image and audio is not affected by the drop case. Rain, day, night, night vision is not affect by lens cover. Recommend this product. Perfect fit for my nest cam. 
13471 4 This item is as advertised. Seller shipped quickly. Would buy again. Two thumbs up. 
13472 4 Awesome results for a fraction of the price! Very cool close ups! Great for close ups of jewelry and insects. Worth every penny! 
13473 4 Good quality good price 
13474 4 Perfect! Highly Recommended ☺ 5 ★ STARS ★ Thanks! A+ 
13475 3 Does the job. Not as nice as the Nikon one. But at 1/3 the price and a couple free goodies in the box. 
13476 4 Very Good 
13477 2 The graduated filter works but isn t really dark enough in my opinion to make a huge difference. The build quality is very cheap and dust sticks to the glass like crazy. Not even close to being a high end grad filter, but will work kinda-sorta-ok. 
13478 4 Great product! Thank you for shipping it sooo fast!!!! 
13479 4 This is the first microscope I have ever owned. For the price it s a nice product. Very professional. Love hooking it up to the computer for a larger screen. No issues so far. 
13480 4 Great product 
13481 4 Works perfect! Arrived sooner than expected. Haven t had any problems with it. 
13482 4 Perfect 
13483 4 Great camera for the price!! Highly recommend 
13484 4 i keep getting asked if the round part is a bottler opener.... 
13485 4 Great product. Now I have a place to put my filters without leaving them on my lenses. The microfiber cleaning cloth; good addition. Thanks. 
13486 4 Right product..timely shipping....great price...charged right up...ready to use as a back-up!!! 
13487 4 Works just as well as the Canon brand battery and charger that I left somewhere in America s national parks last month. A great, cost-effective replacement. 
13488 4 Wow..!! Fantastic camera as I want. Its fell up my expectation. 
13489 4 The PERFECT case for traveling with the Inspire 1. Period. 
13490 4 This thing is big but then I bought it for the Tamron 150-600 which fits just right in it when locked at 150mm with the hood reversed and including the lens collar. Note: lens only, no camera attached. 
13491 4 These came with attached nice retaining strings, along with extra paste on strings. Great buy also with another Magic Fibre cloth too. 
13492 4 I LOVE IT....O PLAY IT ALL DAY FOR TWO YEARS NOW 
13493 2 The tripod itself is great for the price. It does the job that I need it to do. The carrying case on the other hand is terrible. I have had it just under two months and the strap has already come apart. 
13494 0 it is not charging anymore!!!!! 
13495 4 Works and fits my A6000 kit 55-210 lens perfectly! 
13496 4 Don t over fill easier to tie off 
13497 4 Worked out great, have plenty of room for accessories. 
13498 3 Arrived quickly and in great condition.It works ok but doesn t seem to last quite as the original. Just a little weaker I think. 
13499 4 first one got dunked in the ocean - loved the lens so much, I ordered a new one 
13500 4 these have been perfect for my new instant camera that i use on a regular basis. so fun & vintage. we display our photos on our fridge and in an instant film sized album. 
13501 4 Nicely padded, my dad loves it just wish it was a little bit longer 
13502 4 Snuggly holds my cards safely, I really like it. 
13503 1 It wasn t what I needed. 
13504 1 The clamp is great but the quick release tabs on the base of the neck both broke over the course of the first few uses. Now only the clamp is of any use. I wouldn t recommend this at current quality and durability levels. 
13505 4 worked as expected 
13506 3 works great. Also nice useful kit included. 
13507 4 Works great on my camera. I can now easily change from a neck strap to wrist strap in seconds and it is very sturdy. 
13508 3 Very attractive and sturdy posing stool. Assembly was very simple but because of the skimpy packaging, the seat-cushion was left with a large indentation mark that has not gone away after about 4 weeks. The height adjusting mechanism works well. 
13509 4 Good quality and love that it is not attached with a sticker, rather a secure cord. 
13510 0 Half didn t work 
13511 0 Bought this less than 6 months ago and barely made use of it but one of the batteries is a dud already. Disappointed! 
13512 2 Not as good as some other mini tripods, but it gets the job done. 
13513 4 Perfect. 
13514 4 Package was exactly as promised and received in excellent condition. 
13515 4 Awesome camera! Very fun and easy to use. Film is expensive, but what isn t these days? 
13516 4 Excellent product 
13517 0 didn t fit my gh1 
13518 4 Much better than the GoPro stock batteries, and these were fresh and let me motovlog for a lot longer without cutting me off early. 
13519 4 It s a great lens. there is a lot of distortion, but it s possibile to compensate using Camera Raw. Buy yhis just if you know how to work in iperfocal. 
13520 0 Camera is sold by Vivitar as &#34;underwater&#34; witha picture of a diver on the front of the box, yet on further review of the fine print, is only &#34;water resistant to 10 feet&#34;. This is a gross misrepresentation. Buy a go pro or another cheaper camera that is truley waterproof. 
13521 0 Detail of material 
13522 4 nice purchase 
13523 4 This has been a lot of fun to play with. Works fine. 
13524 4 Works really well... for the price 
13525 0 Terrible, terrible , terrible!!!!! 
13526 4 I completely adore these, they are a great catch for something more vintage fashioned when it comes to scrapbooking or even just for a wedding guestbook.Everyone had tons of fun with it, and we ve added it to our best times activity. just to incorporate some of everyone in it! 
13527 4 great item A++++ 
13528 4 works great 
13529 0 Wrong Key code on the software disk. Software will not load. 
13530 4 I love this tripod it is very tall as it says 5 7 it has a very nice height and it is light weight It works well with my Samsung Dv150f 
13531 3 Function OK. Quality OK. Delivery takes time from China. 
13532 4 For the price the quality surprised me. I m pleasantly surprised and happy. 
13533 4 I have Wasabi batteries for my Canon cameras and GoPro Hero 2 and 3. Better than OEM, more power so they last longer. Love the batteries, the chargers are OK - they use the same base and just attach the appropriate battery specific connector. This keeps sliding off. Annoying. 
13534 4 The Sony is great and the service was also! Thanks Beach, I ll come again. 
13535 2 was a good value for a full frame sensor but returned for the D750 which is well worth the the price difference for the added features and low light performance. Wi-fi, flip screen, and higher usable iso made it a not brainer. 
13536 4 They are great! Price is great! 
13537 4 Great little storage album with contemporary feel for 5X7 photos that includes a business card holder. After purchasing the first one, I ve ordered two more. Build is excellent and pages very clear and durable. 
13538 1 Units work, but video quality leaves a little to be desired. 
13539 4 works great for my Panasonic camera and accessories, just right size not too big but still fits everything 
13540 4 exactly what i expected. each lens is a little magnifying glass and pivots. you can individually tighten each one. 
13541 4 good 
13542 4 Use it almost anywhere. 
13543 4 Kenneth helped me with a wireless connect problem. I am setting up a C1. This is my 4th Foscam and every one is doing the job. There can be a long hold time for tech support but they fix it as promised. Highly reccomend Foscam. 
13544 4 By far the best camera in its class for the price! Make sure you shop around for the best deal and you will love this camera! It is very user friendly and takes amazing pictures for experienced Photographer and newbies! 
13545 4 Great price, got it quickly. 
13546 4 Great product and great service from company. 
13547 4 now my tool box matches the rest of my gear cases 
13548 4 Gr8 cam 
13549 3 Was just what I was looking for to Go Pro paddleboarding 
13550 4 Great 
13551 4 I recommend 100% 
13552 3 Using one on each of my Jeeps. One of which is used on a fender lip mount. 
13553 2 Descent midrange price flash. Nothing special. Use for times when a flash is required additional lighting. Not good for doing creative lighting. 
13554 4 Prompt service, good price. 
13555 4 Buen producto. 
13556 4 Great colors! 
13557 1 Couldn t get this to work with my Nikon D600. 
13558 4 Good Quality and Products, just what I needed for my small jewelry photography. 
13559 0 Does not fit my sb400 
13560 3 Well made but a tight fit for a camera with a zoom lens attached 
13561 2 cheap 
13562 4 Lasted longer than standard battery 
13563 3 Film worked as intended, wish it was less cost effective, remember to not shake the photos and to place in the box the film came in to help develop them faster. 
13564 0 Looks like a good quality product, but unfortunately it doesn t fit my gopro as advertised. I have a gopro hero 3. This skeleton housing is slightly too big for the houaing my gooro came with. Too bad. 
13565 4 Good quality camera for the price, but alternative software is highly recommended. 
13566 0 Did not like this item the lights are not bright enough to light the background properly for a good photo. I ve tried everything with this box and my photos do not come out nearly as well as my last box ( different brand). 
13567 3 Great Camera!! 
13568 4 solid, solid, solid!!! 
13569 3 My daughter was pleased 
13570 4 Worked very well shipped quickly and packaged well. All in all is what it says and does what it is supposed to do 
13571 2 Good kit. A couple of additional ways to attach the camera that didn t rely on an enclosure for the camera to be purchased would make it a great kit. 
13572 3 stylish and well made. Blue tooth works wonderfully and is easy to use. Camera is high quality; however, it seems to aim low. Like it is made for people with low setting ears. I only capture about the bottom 2/3 of whatever I am looking at when using the camera. 
13573 4 We swam with wild dolphins.Zip lined across a rain forest.Rode horses threw the jungle and jet boarded in puerto vallarta.But by far the funniest thing was clipping a go pro to our American bull dog puppy.Good bargain for a durable product.Ive told many friends about this deal. 
13574 4 Excellent product .... just missing the feature to turn off the IR in menu, but everything else is there. very quiet, fast, software support multiple cameras, works very well. Audio and Mic are perfect! .... so far GOOD 
13575 3 I have flew it just about 5 times. I carefully read some of the comments here and yes you should make sure you rad and review any information prior to flying this copter. I could see how it could flay away if you don t read the instructions. 
13576 2 Nice case. Just WAY TOO BIG for our needs. Return was no problem. It seemed much bigger than the dimensions (they were correct, just seemed bigger). Had to go a different route. 
13577 4 Very happy with the quality of product. Does what it promises to do. With my glasses, , laptop, tablet, smartphone, and my palm pilot around, I keep these within reach. Thanks 
13578 3 Works as expected. 
13579 2 Dual zipper close -- one zipper broke off within the first week. Velcro &#34;separator panels&#34; are less effective than expect. However, OTHER than that, sturdily constructed -- size\design supports ease of use. 
13580 4 happy 
13581 4 Great grip / cool design / move on! ;-) 
13582 3 They work great put off good light. Carrying bag is cheap and zipper is too but I didn t buy it for the case. Switch was broken on one of the chords but no biggie to just fix myself with a new switch. 
13583 4 Skeleton frame and clear lens cover fits my Hero4 Silver perfectly. All ports, lights, and mic line up with holes in the case. It also comes with a threaded tripod mount. 
13584 4 Great cams! Looks perfect 
13585 3 Excellent 
13586 4 Still charging after 8 months of daily use. 
13587 4 I use this for snorkeling in the red sea on deployment and for riding my bike at home. couldn t be happier! 
13588 4 Nice camera with a lot of features. 
13589 2 Camera takes good quality video. The waterproof case makes the sound not so great. The mounts are decent but DO NOT over tighten them. 
13590 3 asdescribed/ fast ship/ fair price/ recommend seller. 
13591 4 Bought this until I can afford a Nuba led ring light. I m actually really impressed with the performance. I have it paired with a neewer 750 ttl flash and Nikon d3300 
13592 3 The system did exactly what I needed. Soon after using the charger to charge my existing batteries and the new battery, the old charger that I was unable to locate in 3 weeks of tearing the house apart was found in plain sight. 
13593 2 It served it purpose... 
13594 4 Best bang for the buck. I ve used a few of these and they work great. haven t gotten a filter stuck on one yet, unlike some other brands I ve tried. 
13595 3 This camera has helped me collect so many precious memories... 
13596 4 Takes great clear pictures and is light weight. Easy to place in a small purse... 
13597 4 This is nice and works well for my once a month photo sessions. I can t say how it would hold up if you used it everyday and traveled with it. It replaces one almost the same, although this one does have a nicer carry bag. 
13598 4 Very light weight, sturdy easily holding a video head, a DSLR , lens and a slider. gets low, goes high. Feet are soft rubber for inside, reveling metal spikes for outside. Great no nonsense tripod. 
13599 0 terrible quality, the camera is way to small, it is plastic witch makes it eel like youre using a toy, it sucks 
13600 3 Great kit at a great value. I only gave it 4 stars because the selfie stick is useless. It can t handle the weight of the gopro and won t hold it upright. It just spins around and faces down. Other than that piece, the rest seems to be great. 
13601 4 The camera works wonderful and it was the best deal I found! 
13602 4 good really sharp pictures? good camera 
13603 4 Smooth , firm , and steady , the ball bearings do the trick ! Awesome great price 
13604 3 Still learning how to use. Older eyes and small screens.... 
13605 0 returned it ---not good 
13606 4 it helped me wonderful!!! i would recommend it truly , THANKS 
13607 4 Great portable tripod..that can handle full sized DSLR and lens. 
13608 4 A+ 
13609 4 Great lens. All items were as listed. Would purchase again. 
13610 4 Worked fine. I recommend! 
13611 4 Good product for the price. Takes nice pictures. 
13612 4 Crazy sharp! 
13613 4 as advertised 
13614 4 perfect deal. came exactly as expected 
13615 4 Great product and prompt shipment! Thanks!! 
13616 3 for the price, it s worth it. most of the cradles are very tight fitting but they all make it eventually. the case is bulky and there is really no good way to get it all in the case. But, again, for the price you can t beat it. 
13617 3 Worked perfectly. Car charger is an added bonus!! 
13618 0 adequate for the task at hand. 
13619 4 Very pleased with this product! High quality and the cases included are excellent. 
13620 4 This product is so nice my daughter displays it on her desk with her pictures 
13621 4 Return wasn t one we wanted 
13622 4 great product 
13623 4 This is an excellent lens for any photographer/digital artist. I bought the lens for my Nikon D3200. You must use this lens in manual mode settings on camera. After reviewing fisheye attachment lens and true fisheye lens, definitely spend the extra money for a true fisheye lens. 
13624 4 Like it better than other tripods-more flexibility 
13625 4 Bought this for my daughter to take to her trip to Iceland, she was able to fit her camera and lenses in there nicely and loved that she could slide the bag over the handle of her suitcase. Pricey but worth the investment. 
13626 4 great buy since the batteries on the go pro run out quickly 
13627 4 Very nice! 
13628 4 Amazing!!! 
13629 4 Excelent product 
13630 4 This charger pack is an incredible value. I love this new charger. Would recommend 100%. 
13631 1 There batteries really aren t any good. Most times they only charge to 75-80% and they drain way to fast, even when they sit in the camera and it s turned off. 
13632 4 love it! it even comes with the hardware to tighten the screws 
13633 4 Quality glass that is still kicking on my camera a year later. I have nothing bad to say about this product. Will buy again. A+ 
13634 4 Works perfect with the flash, no TTL (i already know it before buying). 
13635 1 Great for 1 dslr camera but not if your needing to carry more then one dslr. 
13636 4 Fast and quit focusing, Sharp Photo s 
13637 4 Camera was like new. Works perfectly and was purchased as a replacement for my broken camera. This like new one reminded me why I bought the original in the first place. Takes fabulous pictures and is light enough to take anywhere. 
13638 4 Works great. Tested the batteries and they charge and work fine. 
13639 2 A little thinner than I expected it to be. If working remotely, be sure nothing reflective like a tv, photograph is behind it as it will reflect the light and give you hot spots. 
13640 4 Exactly what I needed 
13641 4 just what I needed 
13642 4 Fantastic 
13643 4 Well-made product. Nicely priced. Arrived quickly and nicely packaged. Exactly what my daughter wanted. I am sure there will be many many selfies in her cuter. Hopefully, no duck-face. One can hope. 
13644 4 Super 
13645 4 Good Product 
13646 4 Perfect. Exactly what I needed, and arrived in time for my trip to meet my new grandosn, and now I can take pictures because my camera is charged. :) 
13647 4 Always,we re human and will have accidents. 
13648 3 I like the mount. Should have ribbed the barrel so it won t drop down on the stem over rough roads. 
13649 4 Fantastic Quality Color 
13650 2 It s a lot smaller than I thought it would be. Will definitely not fit a 70-200mm lens. Lengthwise or width wise. 
13651 4 Great tripod 
13652 4 Loved it! 
13653 4 very good and steady tripod 
13654 3 The tilt motion has some tension but the pan is really smooth 
13655 4 No problem at all. Shipment time very fast. easy to use, very good quality of pictures. the package was definitely good 
13656 4 This is so easy to use. Works very well. 
13657 4 works very well!!!!!!!!!!!! 
13658 4 Works great 
13659 4 Works great, no problems everything as described 
13660 4 It fits perfectly my Sony HX90V 
13661 4 Perfect replacement lens for one that was dropped in the water at the beach. Works great. 
13662 3 Good: Solid Cheese construction Solid when Screwed down. Bad: No real bad things to say yet. Gets a bit in the way of using the view finder, flipped around or not because of the little butt end that sticks out. 
13663 4 Best friend of Sony Alpha 6000 mirrorless camera for panoramic photo and video with a relative short lens (like 35mm - 85 mm). Otherwise you may need to mount this grip to the lens itself. 
13664 4 Glad I got this when I bought my camera. Perfect protector of the lens at a very good price! 
13665 4 Fine 
13666 0 Does not work at all. Does not hold a charge for the camera. Basically I bought a $50 wall clock 
13667 4 decent quality 
13668 4 It works! I am using this with a Tamron 90mm macro on my OM-D and it works perfectly. The tolerances are nice and tight and the images are great! I have a fotodiox adapter for Canon FD and for Nikon and they all work great! 
13669 4 Exactly what I was looking for 
13670 0 Bags are really loose, neoprene is really thin, won t protect your lenses! 
13671 3 Would be super with a USB plug instead of a car port. Live in the now! 
13672 3 good 
13673 0 FLIMSEY, CANNOT OPEN THE BACK. DON T BUY IT. 
13674 0 This is so thin. I thought it would be thicker and not look like a piece of cheap cloth. 
13675 3 Works really good easy to set up as well.cameras are not the best and 2 of the 4 got wet when it rained other 2 still work good. Company did replace them free of charge. Other than that for price u realy can t go wrong. 
13676 4 This has a one way viewer only, but a good one. Like it. 
13677 4 First time tactual,y ordering these but aftually love it &#60;3 came at the same time it said 
13678 4 Exactly what was needed and wanted. Thank you for the opportunity to once again have my camera. LF 
13679 4 Works as advertised. I purchased these as back up batteries for my camera and they work just fine. 
13680 1 It was a good flash, but it just stopped working about two months later and the company is completely unresponsive. 
13681 4 Great Camera Day or night! Great Value as well........ 
13682 4 More than enough for me. 
13683 4 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039BPG1A/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_13 
13684 4 Works 
13685 4 CASE# C6726445 BADGE ID # AR004228 DLINK tech support made everything a breeze. From A to B, the whole setup was simple and easy. Jenny assisted very clearly and in a friendly tone. The camera is of high quality. Definitely buying more DLINK products in the near future. 
13686 4 My daughter loves this camera & took gorgeous pictures through Ireland, Italy & England!! 
13687 3 works well, is solid, but much heavier than I expected. 
13688 3 Very pleased / works great / had a defective camera called GW and a RM Number was given to return camera / will update progress 
13689 4 Ample space; well built; good looking; fits the bill perfectly for my needs 
13690 4 kenneth did a wonderful job answering my questions. 
13691 4 served my needs 
13692 4 Highly recommended!! Great product. It can be folded to less than 10 inch long, has a sturdy build and work as expected. 
13693 4 IT IS HUMONGOUS! Very protective, but also very thick. I like the fact that I can wrap my lens up as a burrito or baby, hahaha. 
13694 4 Works as well as the battery and charger that came with my camera. Very pleased. 
13695 3 It is what it s advertized to be and works wel 
13696 4 great product 
13697 4 Great price, there was a 5 inch tear in the bag but I will place duck tape inside to &#34;repair&#34; the rip. Great price. Just what I need for vendor events., 
13698 3 Nice soft rubber, fits snug 
13699 1 I was really excited to get my Nikon bundle package today. But then when I took the bag off the carrying case for the camera it was dirty! Not sure if it was used? And if it was what other items in my bundle package were used then re-wrapped? 
13700 4 Works great. We take the battery off after Sun. AM service and it s ready to roll again by PM. 
13701 4 love this lens, very sharp 
13702 4 100% advisable 
13703 4 Works great cleaning my glasses and other electronic devices. Would buy again. 
13704 4 Works Great Now We Get to Use Our Camera again!!! 
13705 2 It s a Holga Lense. You don t expect low-light performance, or high quality feel ( it s all plastic) or pixel perfect reproduction. It s a nice cheap lense for experimenting with stuff. 
13706 4 Great picture quality 
13707 4 Fast delivery from Amazon. Works Great 
13708 3 It operates very well. I am still getting used to at the same time as with Windows 10. It replaces a lost Easy Share that had a rechargeable battery and a docking station. 
13709 4 Not the one pictured. It is the official made in Thailand Nikon OEM 
13710 4 It s works well 
13711 4 If u have a good camera , this product is a must. It protects your investment. 
13712 3 Solid. A bit heavy but on a bad thing for my rig. The holes are not universal for a AB Gold Mount which is why I got two of these but I made it work and it held. Cheaper compared to other 15mm cheese plates so I can t complain. 
13713 4 Higher quality lens than the 1 i had before. Great buy 
13714 4 Really takes so much stress off my neck, thanks so much. 
13715 0 It would not open on Mac 
13716 4 Works perfectly with my Canon M3 mirror less camera 
13717 4 Perfect fit for my Fujifilm S9200 and for my Digital Video Camera. It hold both and a charger at the same time. 
13718 4 item as described and on time. 
13719 3 Works good but you must have it about 3 feet off the ground and the chime is very loud a volume control would be nice 
13720 4 The product works flawlessly being plugged into socket. I didn t try that in autocharger. 
13721 4 Perfect. 
13722 3 This is a decent budget scanner. it won t blow your socks off but as long as you don t mind a little bit off work in Photoshop it s not bad. 
13723 3 does the job, but should be made out of metal for strength 
13724 3 does what it s supposed to. good stuff. 
13725 4 Perfect Bundle, good price 
13726 4 Excellent! 
13727 4 This is the perfect lens for everyday shots. It s fast and compact. 
13728 4 Great scope for the low price ,I bought this for astrophotography. It is well built and works great. I also have the 500-1000mm same brand and from same company The moon shots are very good. I have had no problems with my new scopes. 
13729 4 works really well for the price 
13730 2 This camera is easy to use. Just follow the instruction, I get the video appear in my Android app. The night vision of this camera is poor. 
13731 4 Great item 
13732 4 Great camera. You can t beat the Leica lens. 
13733 4 Excellent! 
13734 4 What can I say but these lights are perfect! 
13735 4 It is very good 
13736 1 Remote viewing is very slow compared to older models. It sucks but the set up is much easier. 
13737 3 WISH IT WORKED LONGER DISTANCE 
13738 4 A++++++ 
13739 0 Does not bring any SD card 6 feet of cable what is that good for you would need an outlet on every camera very very poor quality video super super cheap quality!!!!!!! 
13740 4 As described! 
13741 4 It s very well made and is the perfect fit for our canon camera! We never worry about throwing it in a bag and damaging the camera. Feels protected. 
13742 4 Great quality! Works well. 
13743 4 This is a great camera The image quality is excellent! 
13744 4 Great quality 
13745 3 This was a part of a Christmas gift for my daughter and she likes it tho the photos are rather small. 
13746 0 Garbage product. Broke before I could install it. Again, IT BROKE BEFORE IT WAS USED. That s a little problematic. Don t waste your money. Buy the Canon version. Mine Canon cable is still going strong 6+ years after its purchase. 
13747 4 Excellent!! 
13748 4 Great product. I used it when hiking and it held up. 
13749 3 Works perfect 
13750 4 good 
13751 1 It takes forever to charge an NP970! 
13752 4 Hero2 mounted gimbal-less under my phantom 2, and I have ZERO jello. Awesome. 
13753 3 it does what it says. 
13754 4 ♡ 
13755 3 They seem to work just fine. I have quite a few; probably more than I need. 
13756 4 Henry, Called for help getting set-up to access my camera on my mobile device. Henry was able to use team viewer and went over what he was doing with in 3-5 minutes I was able to connect to my camera! 
13757 4 Works really well. Keep forgetting to turn the mic on and off but the battery seems to be holding up well. 
13758 4 These are excellent - we keep a pile of them around the house as they re the only effective glasses cleaner around. 
13759 4 Excellent 
13760 4 Beautiful pics. Had some glitches at first but Ricoh helped out. Easy to use and the picture quality is awesome. 
13761 4 I am pleased with product. I haven t used it yet but I am just glad that it fits my camera 
13762 4 Works and fast shipping! 
13763 3 I use this lens probably the most - it gets me just the right amount of zoom, and the pictures come out super sharp and clear. Its not clunky or heavy to carry either. 
13764 3 thanks 
13765 4 Bold and nice quality signs! These signs are hard to miss and should serve as a deterrent to would be trespassers. 
13766 0 It does a very bad job of zoom. The zoom feature was why I purchased the camera and if you use the zoom the pics are blurry. I am very disappointed. 
13767 4 Excellent value 
13768 4 Good price, good product. Used them to mount lights for video making. 
13769 0 Volume down button didn t work. I got s replacement and the same thing was wrong with the replacement. I ended up returning both and got a different camera. 
13770 0 I ordered. I charged. It just did not work. So, I returned... 
13771 4 Love it, the quality of the recordings are a lot better than I expected. 
13772 4 great bag. arrived as promised. lots of versatility. 
13773 3 Im happy with the quality and texture of this strap. Im using it on a fujifilm x100t and its secure and at an ideal length. There are slight abbrasion marks on the strap from the camera rubbing against the strap, but Ive conditioned this strap and it restored the texture. 
13774 4 Purchased to wire up security cameras. I checked all with continuity tester and all were functional. 
13775 4 Fits perfectly with my glasses on. Not easy to install on a D90 but with a little extra force, made it to fit. I mostly shoot outdoors so having less light coming from the side of your eye helps a lot. 
13776 2 Good buy 
13777 4 Shipping very fast and easy install. Picture quality is good. 
13778 4 It fits perfectly ..It goes on the computer and camera. 
13779 4 Great batteries! The batteries last longer than the original GoPro battery. Charger has built in plug making it easier to travel with since there are fewer parts to keep track of. Great products. 
13780 4 ok 
13781 4 The best Camera ever!! 
13782 2 It fit the camera but did not work. 
13783 4 Works great and is definitely as advertised! 
13784 4 Perfecr 
13785 2 Very unreliable. When it works, it s great. But I cannot tell you how many times live view simply does not work and I cannot tell you how many times when I try to respond to an alert it simple says &#34;cannot connect right now&#34;. And forget it working wirelessly. 
13786 4 This battery offers more power time (2600 mAh against 1800 mAh Canon battery) for your camera. 
13787 4 This is an awesome monopod. Used with point and shoot and a 6d 
13788 4 nice 
13789 4 Great Buy solid picture quality for landscapes 
13790 4 Works and fast shipping! 
13791 2 Still learning to use them but I like it a lot. 
13792 4 I bought this for my daughter who will be a freshman in college this year. It is very easy to use and VERY loud. Hope she never has to actually use it. 
13793 4 Excellent Filter as expected. 
13794 4 Significantly more compact than the charger included with the A7Rii, and with added LEDs to tell you how far along the charge process is. I consider a pair of these to be an essential part of a Sony kit. 
13795 4 Love 
13796 1 Does not work for the whole range. after a certain point it starts showing an &#34;X&#34; in the picture because areas along the diagonals are darkened more than rest of the image. 
13797 4 Nice 
13798 0 👎 
13799 1 Returned this one as it is not what I expected. 
13800 4 ok;-))) 
13801 1 The product was received in fine condition and was what I expected. The problem is that the movies and pictures on the TV are not in color. This was a surprise. 
13802 4 This case works great. It fits the camera perfectly and keeps it protected 
13803 4 Flys great, camera works great, excellent product. Once you start getting the hang of things, you should look up NAZA mode....NAZA may even better for beginners 
13804 3 Works well 
13805 0 back door does not fit Hero 3. it is too large. 
13806 4 Fantastic camera - still figuring out all the functions and menus, but it takes great pictures, compact in size, good battery life and much more than a point and shoot ! Shipped and delivered the same day. 
13807 4 Just an awesome Toy... A little Tricky but you can get used to it... 
13808 4 very glad I made this purchase. 
13809 3 Picture quality is not great but it keeps my daughter happy. 
13810 4 Arrive fast and exactly as described. Cheap solution for my problem. Thank you! 
13811 4 It s a pelican case, not much more needs to be said. Great for storing my nitrogen regulator ! Longest time I ve kept a regulator without a busted face ! 
13812 3 It is a good scope for the money with lots of attachments you can get for it. However like most of these lower priced ones, the tripods are pretty much useless as far as being sturdy enough. 
13813 4 Good Deal! 
13814 4 Quick order comes with a filter pouch. Nice package 
13815 4 Works like a charm! 
13816 3 I should have waited to purchase one that was a little sturdier and taller. But for the price it is alright. 
13817 3 nice 
13818 4 Was excited to find a clip-on with good reviews as opposed to my magnetic one. Make sure you are super close to the object when using the macro lens. But very happy with this product, and was compatible with my new iPhone 7 as well as my old iPhone 6 
13819 4 excellence, 
13820 4 **Product Received in exchange for honest review** Great quality tripod mount! Works great and made of very durable plastic.. This is just as good quality as any of the other tripod mounts that I own.. I highly recommend this 
13821 3 Nice low cost alternative to a GoPro 
13822 1 Camera did not meet my expectations. The quality of the photos in auto and friendly auto mode is not acceptable. 
13823 4 Perfect!!! 
13824 4 This lens kit arrived quickly, well packaged, and in good working order. I used it during my recent vacation, and was very pleased with the performance of all the lenses. 
13825 3 Excellent Portable tripod. I always toss one into both cars. A little light for my full size Nikon but A1 for my Canon G15 
13826 4 Works great........ 
13827 4 Item collectionable, but like new. It works fine, Im happy whit this purchase. Amazon.com is amazing. Thank´s a lot. 
13828 4 I am very happy not only with the camera, but the cost. As far as I am concerned, this is a new camera to me. I am going to France in the new future and I look forward to using it and getting great pictures. 
13829 4 Prints pictures very well, but can be hard to manage. Otherwise a very lovely, easy-to-manage camera! Gives off good vintage vibes and instantly gives you a nice bit of pretensious hipster flare. 
13830 4 Works great! I lost my charger somewhere when I moved and needed a replacement. Great price and it works well. No doubts my original one will show up now but at least this was a cheap replacement. 
13831 4 a perfect fit for the canon camera. convenient slots for sd card and extra battery. easy to carry in the hand or wrist. a really nice and compact case. 
13832 4 Excellent. 
13833 4 Excellent product.. includes everything and the fancy case is wonderful 
13834 4 Works great. Long battery life! 
13835 1 I had to return for a poorly fitted/errant propeller on the drone. A new one should be sent 
13836 1 does not fit well into the socket. Ruined the Connection of the original automatic lens. 
13837 4 Amazing camera, all came in a big box well protected, I cant wait for my next family vacation to start shooting photos, all the products that came with the bundle are great, not all are the best quality, but for the price the bundle are an excellent deal !! 
13838 4 Light weight and gets the job done without breaking your back. I use it for my Canon 600 at weddings. Of course you need a hot shoe attachment for flashes, don t forget that. 
13839 0 Does not fit well. Keeps slipping of the Canon lens it was built for. Don t waste your money on this piece of poorly made plastic. You should expect more from the lensmaker 
13840 4 Fast shipping and works as promised. My camera was unusable without this so I m happy to have it! 
13841 4 Very great purchase,thanks 
13842 4 OSD anything on a camera this cheap shouldn t be passed up... I ve seen alot of 800, 1000, even 1200 tvl cameras for under $20... they all look like crap in 1080p @ 48&#34;... this doesn t look bad even thou you ld expect it to 
13843 4 Excellent product good quality 
13844 4 Easyh to instal. Camera magnets to it, just like a stock mount. Gives an obtuse rather than acute angle for options for pointing the camera. 
13845 3 Works well with my camera 
13846 4 Fits to camera. allows remote control of shutter and complete control during a &#34;bulb&#34; control for minute plus shots. Reasonably priced - would buy it again. 
13847 4 fast delivery and just what I needed 
13848 4 Perfect holds my military spotting scope 
13849 4 Good fit 
13850 4 I love that camera and extra gadgets;) 
13851 4 This was a graduation gift from college for my daughter. She was so happy to get it and uses all of it for her work and as a hobby. Glad to have found it at AMAZON! 
13852 4 This is the case I use when I m taking extra things with me. 
13853 4 Awesome tripod. My wife bought it for me for my birthday. And it works great. I can set it almost anywhere I want and it stays. 
13854 3 Hope I don t have to use this but I do think its a great deal. 
13855 4 arrived as exactly described! I keep the senior pictures of my friends in this album, and the plastic sheets give the wallets more than enough room 
13856 4 Arrived quickly with a kind note from the sender. A great product really, I ve been using it well for my Sony camera lens and my computer screen. 
13857 4 Nice camera so far, great pictures. Talking it on trip to Utah s National; Parks. Shipped fast, well packaged. 
13858 4 Amazing product i use it on all my shoots for modeling 
13859 3 Much cheaper than the Nikon flashes, with almost the same bells and whistles. Performs great 
13860 4 Great product. Easy to use and ultra good video quality. This customer service is the best part of everything. They helped me through the installation process. 
13861 4 Great hard to find product! Very happy! 
13862 4 Can t use my camera without this... 
13863 4 Great lens 
13864 4 Thank you. All was well! 
13865 4 super camera 
13866 4 This meter is amazing! Growing indoors this is must have tool! I recommend this to anyone who is a beginner or expert. 
13867 4 great seller - delivered as promised! 
13868 1 For the price, this is okay, but the tripod is pretty flimsy. I m no photography expert...and I won t be with equipment like this. 
13869 4 nice 
13870 2 I like it and am enjoying it for the purpose I bought this for... I ll be back for more, it works amazingly well! 
13871 4 Batteries work great. 
13872 1 While the tubes don t lock up on my lenses like others have noted, they are not rigid. Any change in pressure on the lens causes them to flex considerably. 
13873 3 Overall my daughter loves it for changing at dance competitions; however, it is difficult to fold down until you have practiced several times. 
13874 3 I had a 12mm and it didn t give me a full view, this 16mm is about right. 
13875 3 Product appears to be good quality and functions as advertised. Happy with the transaction. 
13876 4 very good protection. good grip 
13877 4 I got one MagicFiber as a free trial with an order from Amazon suppler...Ordered this set ..what more can I say, they work GREAT. Ordered them for my cameras and my wife took one for her glasses... 
13878 4 It s AWESOME! 
13879 4 love this camera, its as advanced as a hobbyist needs thats not into SLRs. excellent photos and fairly easy to learn. the viewfinders fine for me ive seen some complaints. still breaking it in. if you need something larger than a cell phone camera but not super advanced its great. 
13880 4 The best scanner for the price! 
13881 4 Danny was extremely helpful and was very patient. He is a true asset to your organization. kudos to him! Product is extremely effective and delivers on the promise. 
13882 4 Perfect fit for my Norman LH-1 lampheads. Could have used these long ago! Nice product - protects well. 
13883 3 It works 
13884 4 Ar004214 Thank for your support I initially have trouble with my wifi but the tech service Breagan help me to set up the camara and is working very good I do have two cameras. 
13885 4 good 
13886 4 Very excellent item for the price nice resolution and double screen its nice to. 
13887 2 really not that impressed. 
13888 4 Fits on my lens perfectly - just what I wanted. 
13889 4 Fits just right. I m using it on my FE 35mm f/2.8. 
13890 4 Must have for GoPro!! 
13891 4 A lot more dependable than off brand knock offs 
13892 4 Excellent product. 
13893 1 Too much vignetting from using it on the lens, useless. Works ok on the hotshoe, but kinda misses the point to use it like that. 
13894 4 Easy to install and works reliably! 
13895 4 Excellent, stylish and good photos 
13896 4 Great price! Delivered quickly. Works well. 
13897 3 Looks nice. Easy to put on camera. You need to adjust it to your needs. 
13898 4 Great binoculars...just what we were looking for .... THANKS. 
13899 4 I wish the optical zoom is much better. For even close objects after full zoom I have to move closer physically to to the target to get the best pic. Unsure if theres a better way of taking pics. 
13900 4 On time and as described. No issues 
13901 4 These have lasted longer than original GoPro batteries as well as another popular 3rd party battery. Highly recommended. 
13902 4 Great helper, to watch out your house while you are away :) 
13903 0 Flash does not work as advertised. It will not work wirelessly. I contacted the seller for help, but never heard back from them. 
13904 0 it does not fit my camera like it was advertised!!! 
13905 3 This camera was exactly what I was looking for. Would give it 5 stars if the app didn t freeze up so often. Was easy to install and set up. 
13906 4 very good cam for the price. the instruction video was ok but could have been better. overall the camera works great and the pan tilt works much better then I thought it would. 
13907 4 This little bOOger is made very well, great fluidity, and craftsmanship...I highly recommend this high quality tripod. 
13908 4 tks 
13909 4 great replacement battery with fast shipping. 
13910 4 Works well 
13911 4 Great case really love how compact and protective it is. Perfect amount of space for a few accessories. I have been using it for 3 months now with a canon sl1 and don t regret getting this case at all. 
13912 4 The product has arrived and every thing worked as I expected. We have been using the batteries and charger regularly. 
13913 4 Great product. Simple and works! 
13914 4 This is the second fake tv I have ordered and this one worked perfectly. This is the first one I ordered from Three Bears. They were good to deal with. I would have no problem ordering another. 
13915 4 Fast Shipping, made very sturdy, all cameras came on clear. 
13916 4 perfet 
13917 4 These supply an excellent current level for making colloidal silver, and the addition of a couple of alligator clips converts them into great little portable generators suitable for either home or travel. I m very pleased with them, and have recommended them to others. 
13918 4 Excellent goodies for the price. 
13919 4 Th bag is so cute and fluffy, I loved it! 
13920 4 great transaction. Product as described 
13921 3 wish more quality clear camara

13923 4 GOOD QUALITY 
13924 0 I want my money back, not worth the price. 
13925 0 The belt loop breaks fast. 
13926 4 This is the kit that goes with the camera, I bought for my granddaughter. She s had more fun, than I thought she ever would. She loves being able to add her own special creation to pictures. GOOD QUALITY!!! The case is super cute!!! 
13927 4 Perfect!!!! Love this Drone arrived on time as described 
13928 4 Batteries work great and the charger is a good addition. 
13929 4 This kit has the accessories I wanted at a reasonable price.. 
13930 4 Nice set of camera lens adapter rings. 
13931 2 I had problems with CD because it arrived broken. I do not know where get a new one. 
13932 0 Plugged in just as instruction said. About a minute after taking of lost all power and copter board caught on fire. Been flying for a year with no problems until I attached the camera 
13933 4 No issues !!!! 
13934 4 great 
13935 4 Nicely made product; works as advertised. Shipped/arrived on time. Thanks... jb 
13936 4 This product is excellent. Well made and exactly what I was expected. Delivery was excellent and no damage during transit.

13943 4 Arrived safely. Worked great for my trip to the zoo! 
13944 4 Very good 
13945 4 My husband the thrill seeker loves this chest mount! His GoPro was held securely while ziplining, mountain bike riding, and God knows what else he does :). Great buy, shouldn t be disappointed. 
13946 4 Perfect...just what I needed. 
13947 4 Work well! 
13948 2 The price is too much for too little 
13949 0 TERRIBLE, I bought this when i was at the beach. Then took it into the water and it was suppose to be so called &#34;waterproof&#34;. It wasn t and rusted then I was going to use it again and the pole popped right off and bent. 
13950 4 It s an amazing mount! I use it specifically for recording races and other events on my bike. It is extremely sturdy and well made! Totally would purchase again or recommend if anybody needs a mount for their GoPro! 
13951 0 Bough in November, 2014. After July, 2015, they charge about 2 hours of use (one bar). Enveloping plastic detaches from edge, which makes difficult to get battery out of camera. 
13952 0 This item was not working well.... Turned on the camera and I got pictured.. But the picture was blur like smudge ..... Not in good condition... 
13953 4 Good qualities and a great seller. 
13954 4 It must BUY item :) 
13955 4 No problems 
13956 4 Hi...Your timer you send to me is wonderful,i love it,thanks./. 
13957 0 Screen was completely backwards (clock, etc.) Sent it back. 
13958 3 this product was good quality and meant every one of my requirements 
13959 4 The unit arrived in good condition and everything was included as stated. Very good buy for all that you get. 
13960 4 excelent. 
13961 4 This was purchased quite some time ago and it is still holding up strong. I remember not paying a huge price on this and it has certainly served its purpose for my light needs. Lightweight, includes a storage bag. Collapses down pretty compact. 
13962 4 Extremely light and very well made for it s pricepoint. Have no worries mounting my 6D to it. Very compact and easy to travel with as well. 
13963 4 good material i like it. keeps my speed lights tight on those tripods 
13964 4 Works great. The turnover time from order to receipt was very short! 
13965 4 Great performance ! 
13966 3 Nice selection the product price was fantastic and the quality is very nice can wait to start posting videos 
13967 3 ok quality, did the job 
13968 4 These work great on glasses, iPhone, iPad, etc, and they are larger than similar products I have tried in the past. I would definitely recommend. 
13969 3 Works well- worth the money 
13970 4 No problems with the order at all. 
13971 4 Battery works great, and retains power very well. 
13972 1 The Charger is different than the picture and have just one dock for battery, the car charger is different too and is just for this charger and is not possible charge a ipad and iPhone at the same time because doesn t exist usb port.... 
13973 4 Excellent device. Has worked for me for many months. 
13974 0 Junk, send it back to China 
13975 4 I wear glasses and use a nice camera so these come in handy and are thicker than most I ve used. Very pleased. 
13976 4 Worked great! Fit perfectly in my Sony Cybershot W620. Happy with product and quick delivery. 
13977 4 We are trying to catch a car thief who stole my wife s car. He keeps coming back on our property to try again. We hope to catch him with one of these camera. 
13978 2 Not bad for price. 
13979 1 Like everyone else, the base of the arm broke on me after only a couple of uses. NOT WORTH WHAT YOU PAY FOR IT! 
13980 1 If you are a professional....stay away from this....I know...if professional should not be buying this in the first place...correct. If you were to purchase..install and never move or remove...could be alright...third time I removed...the whole entire right side tore from top to bottom...overpriced for what it is. bummer. 
13981 4 I bought the 2 camera system first, it worked so good, i purchased two additional cameras to add to the system. Simple to setup, record and maintain. I use it to monitor the home while away and it works. 
13982 4 Protects my camera from scratch and light bump. Portable n light. 
13983 4 Love it 
13984 4 Perfect replacement (and extra back-up) batteries for my Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX50 16.2 MP Digital Camera. 
13985 4 This is a hd camera and it perfect for inside. I had no problem with the install 
13986 2 Excellent camera; cheap goodies. 
13987 4 Works perfectly at a fraction of the cost. 
13988 4 These are really good stands! I use them with the NEEWER 160 LED CN-160 Dimmable Ultra High Power Camera Video Lights and it s a perfect combo. 
13989 4 So thrilled with this strap and the quality. Perfect for my Fujifilm instant camera! 
13990 3 It was easy to install take a little wild to reach me be it s work well 
13991 4 Optically, they re awesome. I can now bring nature and wildlife from afar to what seemingly appears to be within arms length. Great value and quality. 
13992 4 Perfect 
13993 4 Awesome and great price point! 
13994 4 Love this bag. It has been handy, and a great move up from my standard case. 
13995 0 The tripod is not stable. When I attached the selfie stick to the tripod, it tilted over and dropped. I would not recommend this product if you are looking for a tripod to hold the selfie stick for pictures and recording. 
13996 3 very good just wish it had an on when dark and off when light setting. the 4 or 8 hour option at dusk doesn t cover the entire night 
13997 4 Great batteries and charger!! fit perfect on my camera!! 
13998 4 Delivered on time. Good value 
13999 4 Nice quad-copter for the price. Software is easy to use. Resolution on the camera is pretty good. Easy to assemble the parts that are included. Very durable so far. I have even had it stuck in a tree one and retrieved it. It s fun to use! 
14000 4 Bon produit et livraison rapide 
14001 4 They work great 
14002 4 Besides the nostalgic look, this half case really improves the hand grip of the Df. It makes using longer zoom lenses and/or holding the Df for a prolong period of time much more comfortable. 
14003 4 Great! 
14004 4 Using it with a Sony action can, smooth rotation, good price, standard tripod mounts top & bottom 
14005 4 Well put together kits. Was given as a gift. She loves it 
14006 4 Great product, love it! 
14007 4 For the price you can do so much, yeah the screen and veiw finder is low res, but the image is not. 
14008 4 Worked for me. 
14009 4 I like the product. Its exactly what I´ve expected. And the personal letter sent by the manager of the company makes you feel really good and makes you feel you are buying a good and quality product. 
14010 4 Very clear picture 
14011 4 nice 
14012 4 great. 
14013 4 It took some trial and error, but it all works now as expected. 
14014 4 Quick Delivery and came as stated!! 
14015 4 Easy to setup, great audio, well worth its price, and extremely stable. I highly recommmend it!!! 
14016 3 I bought this devise to help me clean the inside of my sewing machine. It blows all the tiny threads and lint and is very helpful. The rubber feels strong when squeezed, so I feel confident that this product will last a long time. 
14017 4 Shipped promptly; was nicely packaged; fit the camera well. Seems to be high quality glass. 
14018 0 it is the fourth one I have purchased hoping it would work. its a hit and miss (with most MISS) also if I am lucky it records but can t play it on any of my computers 
14019 2 This camera worked great for two years. I used it in the Caribbean once and then the next day, the screen went black. It lasted almost exactly until the two year warranty wore off. :-( 
14020 0 Charged this battery upon arrival. Camera ran less than one minute and died. Not pleased at all. 
14021 4 ...Works perfectly. No complaints. 
14022 0 not part what I needed 
14023 3 Smaller then appears,good quality. 
14024 4 Perfect! Highly Recommended ☺ 5 ★ STARS ★ Thanks! A+ 
14025 4 Awesome! I had no problems installing it and it seems to hold a charge much longer than the old one. 
14026 4 Super easy to connect and works just like it s supposed to. Very fast delivery too! 
14027 3 Does what it says 
14028 4 This lens is absolutely wonderful. I thoroughly enjoy using it. 
14029 4 Looks very nice, Good Quality. 
14030 4 Purchased this months ago for spring break beach trip... used it through summer for pool adventures. Durable and great pics (lighting does matter) for the price of the camera. My boys take it away and I love watching the underwater videos that they come up with. 
14031 4 High quality images and video! I ll be making YouTube videos and such using it! Extremely easy to use with the phone app as well. I love taking it to the gym. 
14032 4 Works great 
14033 4 Keeps my GoPro visible and floating on top of the water! I love it! 
14034 4 Fantastic.. Easy to use. Well constructed. 
14035 3 I have not had a chance to use these yet, but I did test them out and they work fine. 
14036 4 Have bought Wasabi kits for several of my cameras. They all work flawlessly. 
14037 0 This is NOT a 500 watt light. It is 75 watts, equivalent to a 300 watt incandescent bulb. 
14038 2 The extension clasps are very hard to work especially if your hands are wet. 
14039 4 Just what I expected. Works well and both my kids and I can wear this snapped. It s a little bulky on the wrist strap but you definitely can t lose it. 
14040 4 Product arrived quickly and was as described. 
14041 1 Night time photographs do not show beyond 15 
14042 4 Pleased 
14043 3 A true five star product if it came with instructions. I would have gladly paid double the price for the inclusion of an instruction booklet with code examples and wiring charts. 
14044 4 Light weight tripod and it is still sturdy. Used in some windy conditions and had no trouble. 
14045 4 It does what it has to do. Ok. 
14046 0 These binoculars were too big for my use 
14047 4 Excellent tripod to get the job done 
14048 4 Scheduled for delivery on Sunday! Didn t think it would actually show up, but it sure did! Good quality, perfect for day trip, not meant to hold everything you own. I like the precut cutouts. 
14049 4 It is really expensive but I really loved how it worked with my polaroid 3500! 
14050 4 I love that I found this on here because no one sells this battery for my camera! It works great and i love the price I got everything for. 
14051 4 Very portable and easy to set up. We use it as a projector screen as well. 
14052 4 This camera far exceeded my expectations. The video is amazing and the photos my husband took of the moon were so clear I thought he had downloaded them off the internet to play a joke on me. The zoom was so amazing we could see the craters in the moon! 
14053 4 I absolutely love this camera. Takes amazing pictures and video underwater. I still use this camera to this day dont forsee getting a new one any time soon. 
14054 4 Works like a dream 
14055 4 They do the job well. Just watch out for the little slips on the ends, they tend to break off, if used a lot. 2 pairs of mine, have lost the ends so far, and they are non-usable after that. 
14056 4 Installed it and it worked, not sure what else I can ask for. 
14057 1 Focus range is so small that it s impossible to use even on a tripod. Seems to be clear enough that it might be a good lens but the focus is just too shallow. 
14058 2 Does what it s supposed to. A bit pricey to be made of paper. 
14059 4 Product works great. Price much lower than brand found in store. 
14060 1 I still haven t figured out how to set it up. No support. 
14061 3 The camera is fine but the on-board memory is pathetic, all but requiring the purchase of supplemental memory cards. Consider the memory card as a hidden cost when buying this camera. 
14062 4 Made my own Google Cardboard. These lenses did a great job and worked great. 
14063 4 My daughter is fascinated 
14064 4 Worked perfect with my Arlo security cameras. 
14065 3 Works well. It even comes with a car charger. Plus the two battery pack I bought with it means I won t be caught without battery power for my camera. 
14066 4 Hard cover to provide good protection. Ample space for essentials. 
14067 4 Great package deal! I love the camera 
14068 4 Amazing camera!!! 
14069 1 Basically an Eggtimer with cool graphics. No adjustable settings and the 1hr. limit and rotating speed made the timelapse seem rushed. the top also fell off. Not a great buy for $35 
14070 0 It was cracked. I took it into the water and it started to flood. Luckily I noticed it before it killed my go pro 
14071 4 first time for a digital camera. I have always had Canons. My lens from my Rebel 2000 also work on this one. Very happy easy to understand and download pictures onto computer. 
14072 4 Worked very well! 
14073 4 Arrived safely. Worked great for my trip to the zoo! 
14074 4 Bought this after a bit of a hunt through competing listings. This hit the sweet spot of wanting clear protective lenses with cap holders and not much more for my new Canon camera with an extra telephoto lens. Good price and very rapid delivery. Would use again. 
14075 4 Great color & pattern - interchangeable is the best! 
14076 1 It can only record for a maximum of 25 minutes. I bought it to record lectures but it s just sitting home now. The battery is not strong at all. 
14077 4 Recieved in timely manner. Very satisfied! Now able to enjoy watching my home movies! Thank you so much! 
14078 4 Love this - works well, even with Linux! 
14079 4 I love having these magic fiber towels on my office desk. I use it to clean my monitor, tablet screens, phone screens, and my keyboard which has a glossy finish. Highly Recommended! 
14080 2 Images have a strong magenta cast difficult to control even indoors. 
14081 3 does the job 
14082 4 Better than expected! 
14083 4 Smaller than I thought but well constructed and very useful for the photographer that needs an extra hand. It looks great on my Canon 40D. 
14084 4 Great product for a great price. Cant go wrong 
14085 4 Having fun with it! 
14086 4 Works perfect. Got it for my Grandmother. Super easy for all her kids and grand kids to send pictures. Easy to manage the account online from afar. 
14087 4 Excellent cameras. 
14088 4 works good when you aren t in the wind, already had one of my speed light stands break because of these but oh well that was my fault. 
14089 4 exactly as described. 
14090 3 Great quality glass on this pair of binoculars. 
14091 3 It s been good to transfer our slides to digital. Easy to use. 
14092 4 It s really awesome camcorder. 1080p is a steal for this price. I used it in Kauai for snorkeling and helicopter ride. It s priceless. I recommend this camera. 
14093 4 Offers great protection for my lens, easy to clean 
14094 4 Great wide angle lens that takes fabulous color! A must-have addition to your DSLR kit. 
14095 3 depth of field with small f-stops resolved! 
14096 3 Great price it does it s job. 
14097 1 Freezing to much on the app and i do have the faster business Internet at home. I restart the cameras 3 times already because it didn t work. 
14098 4 As advertised 
14099 4 Great product! 
14100 4 Does what it s supposed to do. Great cheap alternative from Amazon. 
14101 2 good 
14102 4 Works fine for the price. 
14103 2 so so~ 
14104 4 It s hard to beat Kodak s TMAX 100. 
14105 0 Never worked with iPhone. Now in junk drawer. 
14106 4 Ricardo John great service and great camera! awesome business 
14107 2 Did not really fit my Samsung NX mini which is the smallest nx camera samsung has for its mirrorless camera. The case did not leak at all. The case is meant for smaller point n shoot and not mirror less cameras which are slightly bigger. 
14108 4 Love it. 
14109 4 love the wide angle of the lens and image quality. I wished to purchase 14-24 mm based on reviews but happy with this lens now. 
14110 4 they work out and are very usefull 
14111 4 I can view the record directly from the APP, so good 
14112 4 I love it. it s a bit big but I am sure I will soon fill it with all kinds of gears. 
14113 0 Was not for your shoulder like it says and it is very short even for around your neck 
14114 4 Glad I chose this camera. One of the best ones out there for outside. 
14115 1 Poor quality even at this price. The float mount broke right away. The selfie stick is ok, but can be purchased alone and not in this kit. For use with my action cam in the water, I opted for the neomark wrist mount and was very pleased with it. 
14116 3 The camera was relatively easy to setup, and the picture quality is alright. The build in audio isn t the greatest, but it has ports to plug in your own speakers/ mic for the camera if you want better ones. I have not had any issues with the camera yet. 
14117 3 Good price. Ok batteries not as longest lasting as GoPro brand. At least you get two of them though and a nice dual charger. Nice to have backups. 
14118 1 Sucks. 
14119 4 Fast charging on the go. Nice for getting another flight in when you all you have is your car. No issues and I ve used it several times. 
14120 4 I just received the tripod and it is awesome! I love the bluetooth capabilities! 
14121 4 Great product 
14122 2 loose range quickly 
14123 4 I absolutely LOVE this!! Definitely gives me a more professional look!!! 
14124 4 very nice very nice to product especially to selfie loving people.it is an all in one and very handy to carry for holiday packers. can be recommendable. 
14125 4 Perfect fit for my larger tripod. 
14126 4 product as advertised, very good 
14127 2 It s made fairly well, but I expected a much higher level of quality if it was originally 79 dollars as stated. 
14128 4 Compact. Great quality. 
14129 3 gracias 
14130 0 Broke the first day..... 
14131 4 Works nicely! I also like that It comes with extra batteries, for use on vacation. 
14132 4 Batteries arrived in a timely manner and were just what I expected. 
14133 4 Great idea for taking better photos. Easy to use and adjustable so it fits my Samsung phone too. 
14134 4 Great shipping time, used this at church today to video the children s service with my daughter operating it with no problems! 
14135 4 Fits phantom 3 perfectly 
14136 4 great products. Thanks 
14137 3 Works great. On a full charge its only rated at about 8-10 minutes, but I have gotten 12 minutes out of a battery. 
14138 4 Didn t set it up wirelessly but so easy! 
14139 4 Love love love my Nikon camera. I have taken over 500 pics already and think I may have found may new calling. Very happy with this product. 
14140 0 Didn t like this. The case was too small for the GAlaxy2 camera and would sometimes turn the power on as you slid it into the case. May be ok for a smaller device. 
14141 3 Good for group shots you want to be in 
14142 3 This is awesome. If it came with a case or something I d give it 5 stars. 
14143 4 As described. Love the camera. Great pictures for an entry level photographer. Takes time to get used to the camera as a newbie and a lot of trial errors but I ll get used to it soon enough 
14144 3 This is a surprisingly good camera! Not quite five-star outstanding, but I am very, very happy with it. My family owns two now :- ) 
14145 0 Optic tubes were not aligned. Two discrete images with an angular separation both horizontally and vertically. This should have been discovered before shipping by simple inspection. Did not re-order. 
14146 4 Arrived PDQ and was as advertised, very happy with items so far. 
14147 4 Perfect for my eight year old, Instent gratification, we got through a pack of photos in an evening. Quality of the pictures is good. 
14148 4 All Great!!!! 
14149 4 This package includes far more than what you could find at other Big Box stores. It is a true bargain. 
14150 0 Crazy number of tiny parts to assemble and instructions were worthless. 
14151 1 I was extremely disappointed with this product. This product isn t durable enough for children. This was purchased for my son. He dropped it and it broke.... He was heart broken. It was money basically thrown in the garbage Now I have a very disappointed child. 
14152 1 low quality photos 
14153 4 This works well and does everything I need. The camera setup was straight forward, configuring the firewall an DNS required more knowledge. 
14154 4 Worked fine 
14155 4 Good quality, delivery on time! 
14156 0 the film we got was outdated in 2008 pleas give me my money back 
14157 4 Yup. It s a photo album that holds 504 photos and yes, it s worth it. 
14158 2 Works great but very difficult to setup. Took two people 3 1/2 hrs. to finish setup, could not connect to my Apple MacBook Pro. 
14159 4 A must purchase battery and charger. 
14160 3 Works great and is a must have when using in the ocean so that you don t loose it. 4 stars because the price was a little high. You pay the extra money for the brand instead of for the material. I recommend buying from different distributor. 
14161 0 Total FAIL. Camera mount completely came apart and we lost our camera in the waves. Do NOT buy if you care about your camera 
14162 4 5 star 
14163 4 I love the texture, they are almost suede feeling. Those are the kind I love most because they remove debris and grease from my glasses and other lenses so much better, highly recommend! 
14164 4 Does the job. Does unravel itself but it still functions the same. 
14165 4 Good for just taking around what you need 
14166 4 Did the trick. Fixed tethering issues without adding power. 
14167 4 excellent product 
14168 4 With a newborn we wanted to capture the moments that were just to long to use the IPhone. This is easy to use and very compact. I really like how you do not need to remove the battery to charge it. Thanks 
14169 4 I really love my new camera! I wanted to get something that takes really nice pictures yet affordable so I was a little nervous on ordering this product since I have never had a Sony camera but I am absolutely happy with my purchase! It s takes great pictures! 
14170 4 Good product 
14171 4 Its perfect and very comfortable 
14172 0 -0 star junk THE END 
14173 4 gave as part of gift bag for someone with new Go Pro and they loved it! 
14174 4 Just received this lens cover 2 of them and they fit perfect and fit good feel sturdy and not loose like my other ones. If I continue to loose them will def be ordering more :) 
14175 1 Can not adjust the sense with this bag. Pictures look a bit blury. not that happy, but it was cheap. 
14176 4 Just what I needed. Very good for laptop and glasses! 
14177 4 Excellent! Thank you!! 
14178 0 This is NOT plug/play. It is plug/install an executable from china/play. It requires flash which is on it s last leg as software. This does not work with Blue Iris software. You cannot play the video without installing their software. 
14179 2 No comments 
14180 4 Buy it or lose your gopro. 
14181 3 Price was right. Only used a few so far and they seem OK, but I m not yet sure. 
14182 4 Love it. 
14183 4 Solid tripod. With the right adapter it holds my iPhone 6 perfectly. 
14184 3 Camera great, servive fair but has gotten better 
14185 4 Ordered it and it came in a reasonable time. The strap is great and feels comfy on my neck. The look and feel of it is also amazing as well. I ll definitely be buying more straps from here in the future. Thanks again! 
14186 2 as expected...hated the short and non-microusb cable for charging 
14187 4 Bought as a gift for my Nephew. He liked it. 
14188 2 Ok for a gift! 
14189 4 Great price! Came fast ! 
14190 3 It seems to work as advertised 
14191 4 Excellent alternative to tracking down a factory battery for the early generation gopros. I have a Hero2 with a WiFi &#34;bacpack&#34; and the battery lasts just as long as my brand new hero4 black. 
14192 4 got here in nothing flat.. excellent!! 
14193 3 very good system 
14194 3 Thank you! 
14195 4 Inexpensive replacement battery, seems to work as good as the original. 
14196 1 Ended up keeping since the return shipping would make it a wash. NOTE: There are NOT 50 LEDs as claimed in the description- just one blinking red light. Meh 
14197 4 Fits everything you can use!!! 
14198 2 It s just personal preference...nothing really against the product. 
14199 4 Very satisfied with this purchase. The payment and shipping went very smoothly and quickly. 
14200 4 This bag is great for the Nikon D7100, my dad loved it for his birthday! It also came just in time for our Colorado trip 
14201 4 Great little cleaning kit, although the plastic bag it came in fell apart as I took it out of the box. 
14202 4 These are great IP cameras for around the house. They can FTP snap shots or video to any FTP server. 
14203 2 It s ok....the screw is crap it won t screw in anymore it s a good thing the go pro came with extras...if you want to use it for the outside of a car I recommend the actual gopro suction cup... 
14204 4 This is exactly the same as the original and charges the battery great! 
14205 4 Fit good on my nikon d7100, if not placed correctly it comes out in the picture, but then u rotated it an it was no longer in the way of the pictures 
14206 4 Love the metal mount on this product. Really dosen t add weight to the mask. 
14207 4 This product replacement! My security system battery died unexpectedly and this worked just as well. I expect it to last many years to come. 
14208 4 Works perfectly to connect my Olympus camera to my PC so that I can save photos to my computer. 
14209 4 Was for the Camera 
14210 3 Love the quality and look of the case! The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because although manufacturer claims it will fit a Canon Powershot SX60 camera, IT DOES NOT! If that is what you have, I would not recommend you ordering this product. 
14211 4 Bought this as a gift for my mother in law before she left for the family reunion. I figured it would be good for the group shots. I think she enjoyed it. 
14212 4 Amazing camera! And this bundle is quite the bargain. I should know. I shopped around for two months and this is by far the best deal. Shipped quickly and packaged very well. Highly recommend this product and this seller. 
14213 3 Price is right. Easy setup initially. Trouble getting sound from two separate computers. Tech help said it was computers fault. Both computers? Works fine on I phone. Now I can t even get a picture on those computers. Hate to invest hours in tech support. 
14214 4 Well worth the price! I like the removeable head. 
14215 2 Not very durable didn t work very long 
14216 4 Works well.Note it is the same adapter as the Kenko Teleplus 2X 7 element for Nikon AF, the 2 are the same inside, identical aside from brand name and minor cosmetic differences. Save a few $. 
14217 4 Very good protection that is sized for specific Sony lenses. This one is sized for the SELP1650 
14218 3 It does the job 
14219 4 I can t wait to use this thing on all my adventures. Came with charger, case, battery, and attachment for the case. 
14220 0 Very cheaply made, and cannot even figure out how to use it (no, it isn t simple at all -- actually has two pieces. Huh? Just another lesson in purchasing on the cheap. 
14221 4 The cameras work very well on the FPV plane and has a very clear picture, The seller was very prompt in getting the cameras out and to me 
14222 0 I did not receive the product shown in the pictures. Very dissatisfied right now 
14223 4 Great 
14224 4 Good quality. Good light. Very easy to assemble. I wish there was a simpler method to rotate the softbox from portrait to landscape. Overall, a great product at a great price. 
14225 4 Perfect! 
14226 1 Show a great pic..just had a line on one side, this was suppose to be a new item, but I think it was a use item, maybe or maybe not..but great pic on oneside. 
14227 4 Loved it 
14228 4 Worked like a charm! Thank you 
14229 3 Well built easy to open & close ,i play inside with my nikon 7100 with 18-200 no probleme very sturdy, next i try in the field,that would be the test,I have a larger & heavier $600.00 tripod this dolica would be easier to hike with. 
14230 0 DON T WASTE YOUR TIME BUYING THIS! NO INSTRUCTIONS AND ALL THE PARTS WEREN T INCLUDED. 
14231 3 The filter is quality made at a reasonable price. I use filters primarily to protect the expensive lenses that they are attached to from dust and debris. 
14232 2 Just not loud enough! 
14233 4 I am having such a great time using my new camera. Came with a dvd with tips on it for us amateurs to get a leg up. Awesome value 
14234 3 It would ve been 5 I ve stars if it wasn t 5 days late but it s a good product 
14235 4 Ok 
14236 3 I am happy with the product as well as shipment on time. 
14237 4 I use this product on my house because my neighbor is damaging my property and what better way to catch him with out having to go to extremes. I hope he keeps doing it. Great buy. .. 
14238 4 Fast shipping, great price! 
14239 0 broke after about 6 months. I used it about 3 times within those 6 months :( 
14240 2 Had to fuss with it for quite awile to get it paired with my SmartThings hub. No complaints once getting through the pairing process. 
14241 4 great 
14242 1 Pictures didn t turn out the way they were supposed to, and it only came with 8 pieces of film. Not worth almost $28 in my opinion. 
14243 4 I bought this to go with my Polaroid camera. But whats so cool is that it works with any cellphone or tablet. YOu can print memorable photos instantly. This is great especially for vacation which I will be going on next week. So excited. 
14244 3 cool. 
14245 4 Excellent seller recommend 100% 
14246 4 Fabulous. Works like a charm! 
14247 4 fit perfectly! 
14248 3 Easy to take a photo of me! 
14249 1 The quallity its very poor, i prefer at least 1080p of resolution. Another important thing is the angle camara, with gopro i had 170 degrees and with brinno only 14p0 
14250 4 love it 
14251 3 This provides serious protection for your camera. The fit is nice, and there are openings in strategic places for connections. The only downside is that manipulating the cover can be a bit tedious. The snaps work well, holding everything together, and yet are reasonably easy to open and close. 
14252 4 Really like the camera. The only problem is keeping my hand away from area when flash pops up. Easy to charge and take pics. 
14253 4 beats replacing a perfectly good camera 
14254 2 Ordered several. Wide angle lenses are great and worth the $7.95 each alone. However, the fish-eye lenses are blurry, not because of foreign matter or scratches (lenses are clear and smooth), but just the way they were made (they were all the same) 
14255 0 I live in a very hot area, the glue loosens from the back and the adapter (and the attached lenses/filters) falls off of the camera... what a waste of money, useless 
14256 4 AMAZING THIS TRIPOD IS VERY NICE, GOOD STILL, LIGHT WEIGHT NICE DESING IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SAMM TIPOD THIS IS THE BEST CHOISE 
14257 4 I ve been using this camera for years and it s still going strong. 
14258 4 Great camera - takes good pictures with enough pixels to get good quality. 
14259 3 nice kit at the right price 
14260 4 Great deal. good quality lens for our Canon DSLR and great items given with. 
14261 4 Works great. Fits my iPhone 6 perfectly. 
14262 4 Excellent dslr viewfinder. Comfortable on the eye, easily removable. The rail kit is also handy for adding other accessories or weight to your rig. 
14263 3 Already have some. These last longer than the battery that came with the camera, I get ~250 stills with these. I always carry a spare. The deal where you get two batteries plus a charger is a good one, already have that so I just got the battery this time. 
14264 4 perfect 
14265 3 Nice little dash cam. Works very well. 
14266 4 Daughter loved it ,great for party favors fast ship quality item 
14267 4 I read the reviews on this tripod and am happy to say it works great, easy to wrap around just about anything or stand on anything and with my Canon Rebel T31 it works great. 
14268 4 This attractive bag holds my Sony A7 w/ kit lens with room to spare. With the extender open, it will hold my Sony A7 with a Minolta MD 70-210 F4. Works great for carrying around a camera a single lens. Arrived in great condition and on time. 
14269 4 Great! 
14270 4 Works great. Can image for 4 min with my camera unguided. 
14271 4 Fit perfectly 
14272 4 Just the best seller! Cable was perfect as is this seller! 
14273 4 Daughter loves it. 
14274 3 Great little tripod for the price. However the first one I received was defective -- the camera wouldn t attach properly and it was missing a tightener screw. 
14275 0 pictures are so tiny you can t see it clearly,so I ll return it 
14276 4 THANKS I BROUGHT TO HAVE AN EXTRA ONE,AND IT WORKS JUST GINE,AND COST WAS GREAT 
14277 4 Great buy. Worth the investment. Extras are awesome!!!! 
14278 4 Just as described 
14279 4 Expect two different packages one with just the pipes and the second with the base plates. 
14280 2 After moderate use, the belt attachment is tearing from the case. Otherwise, it s a very good case. 
14281 4 I really loved these lights. Had two of them. Eventually the battery cells wore down and the light only lasts a few minutes at most. 
14282 0 Battery did not hold a charge, was unchargable so I returned it for a refund 
14283 4 excellent 
14284 2 Pretty sure I could come up with a smarter design. It s so oddly designed. I ll be losing the brass fittings sooner or later guaranteed. 
14285 3 Love the camera. The speaker and mic don t work as well as I d like, but i can overlook that. The subscription price seems a little high. 
14286 4 good camera 
14287 4 I love this little case I got for my camera. Debating on purchasing one for my daughter. Nice material and print is just gorgeous. 
14288 4 Great pack! Now just the camera cost $499, the Wasabi Batteries cost $23.99 and Lexar 32GB card is $24.99. 
14289 4 good quality 
14290 3 So far-all is well. Takes me awhile to figure out all the buttons, seems to be perfect. Took it kayaking with me and didn t have to worry about getting it wet... 
14291 4 Awesome value for money, it breathed new life into our Canon SL1 (which has a rather pathetic battery)... all the extra add-ons were a nice touch and, but really you are getting two good batteries and a backup charger. 
14292 4 Fantastic camera package for the price. All items listed were in box. Brand new unused. No issues. All parts fitted perfectly. Camera is amazing. Shipping was amazing. Definitely great service. Thank you Celltime ! 
14293 1 After one month of use it restart with no obvious reason at random time 
14294 4 Super Clear! 
14295 3 only one battery of the 2 worked for me 
14296 0 It is a big disappointment,it worked just during installation with good audio and Vedic but late the audio turned to one way traffic. The outdoor will hear you but you can t hear from indoor. It is a wast of money.Video picture is great and clear.This product needs improvements. 
14297 3 Takes good photos and has everything a casual camera user like me would need. The menu navigation is awkward and slow and I ve had difficulty getting it synced up over WiFi to my phones and desktop. 
14298 4 Great camera! Easy to use. Fast efficient shipping. No complaints! 
14299 4 Super easy to use. It feels sturdy even when it is fully extended and it holds my Samsung Note 2!! I took it with me on an out of state trip and it fit nicely in my carry on. Great price too. 
14300 4 Greate lense 
14301 4 Use this all the time. Great range and better than the standard remote that came with my camera. Be sure to keep extra batteries because it is easy to leave it on and the batteries not work. For $30 you will not find a better accessory for your camera!! 
14302 4 So happy, they work great and give me a long life for my camera. 
14303 2 The charger didn t work. Plus it didn t come with a lens. 
14304 4 Wasabi batteries never let me down. Good quality at a reasonable price. They are my &#34;go to&#34; batteries 
14305 4 Provably the best that I have used and properly priced too. 
14306 4 I have never been disappointed by Tiffen quality. Would and have recommend Tiffen filters... 
14307 4 Nice case. Neatly stores all of the GoPro accessories in a padded area with snug compartments for each accessory which prevents them from just rolling around in the case. Nice upper storage area on top of the case inside as well for additional items. 
14308 4 Love it 
14309 4 Henry did a great job with helping me solve my issue with camera , and got me up and running 
14310 4 Great camera, no complaints other then there being no memory card included. 
14311 4 I liked this bag so well, I bought one for my best friend. Well-designed and tough. 
14312 4 Performs as advertised. 
14313 4 Everything was great, timely delivery. 
14314 4 Husband absolutely loves this camera! 
14315 2 Cheap. 
14316 4 Works perfectly for my Canon Rebel T5i 
14317 2 is ok but not really impressing that much. i was hoping for more changes in the picture..... 
14318 2 too much flexible, dificult to remove the bubbles 
14319 4 Great quality and much more cost effecitve solution than the OEM. 
14320 2 works with my Nikon D200. 
14321 4 Works great. I can finally use my Polaroid camera again 
14322 4 Fantastic filter. High transmission. No decker able color cast. Very thin. Does not bind on lens. I d love to replace all my filters with these. 
14323 4 Excellent! 
14324 4 Great 
14325 4 Very good kit. 
14326 4 nice 
14327 1 Much better options available. Not very solid 
14328 3 Cute little photo album. It s not the best quality, but I bought it for my 9 year old and she doesn t notice things like that. If she wanted another one I would buy it again for her. 
14329 3 it is really fun and easy to control however the battery life is bad it well give you 2 to 5 min max and it take about 2 hours to charge 
14330 4 My old cable and power supply was giving me trouble so when got this seems to be working as stated in the ad with no trouble so far 
14331 2 Item is made out of plastic, it arrived broken. Should be made of something sturdier or shipped better. Nice idea though. 
14332 4 Amazing 
14333 4 This item was fantastic, fit perfectly, and just as described. The seller was great. Absolutely no complaints! 
14334 2 I could not use it with my camera, but the product was as advertised. Returned with no problem. 
14335 4 Nice sharp lens to compliment my D5200. Pictures look sharper than my older 18-105. Love the size because with the D5200 it makes for a very compact grab and go camera. 
14336 2 Camera did not wow me built quality ok video quality not great very user friendly one of the easiest I have set up over all good for basic around the house surveillance not great on detail pixels 
14337 0 Too small and rip apart too easily 
14338 2 Work fine Gets the job done 
14339 4 love my strap! tho the thread came out a little, I just cut it off a bit. 
14340 4 i continue to buy more. these work great. 
14341 4 This is a good, durable case for the RX cameras. It also has an extra pocket for a memory card. I have an RX-100ii camera which is an excellent little camera to bring on a vacation. 
14342 4 Great camera quality and value! I opened it up and played with it for a while to try out all of the different settings. It is easy to use and takes great pictures! I would definitely recommend this camera! 
14343 4 I use this on a Fujifilm X-E2 for the large handful of vintage M42 lenses that I own. It has a substantial feel to it and it just works as advertised. 
14344 3 Great product. 
14345 4 A+ 
14346 4 DSTE is the best non OEM grip out there period! I ve tried 3 others and this grip is by far better. The build is spot on with the OEM and all buttons/knobs work just like the OEM. The seller shipped fast from China and it arrived 8 days early. 
14347 0 Impossible to set up. Do not waste your time. 
14348 4 Works great just the right fit! 
14349 4 Very useful. 
14350 1 Had to return it the first time because the battery was not charging (after waiting more than a month for the camera to be delivered). The second camera I received is ok, but my phone takes better pictures. 
14351 4 Great lens! 
14352 4 Ok 
14353 3 good to have! 
14354 4 perfect to keep an eye on my bbq pit tempature guage from inside the house. 
14355 4 I purchased this for my son s rehearsal dinner. I tested and it took great pics. I liked it so much I purchased twice as much film as needed. I also purchased the little lens for selfies/close-ups. I may buy another camera! 
14356 4 Great 
14357 4 Excelent , 
14358 4 Works excellent for the money. Great starter copter 
14359 1 Good action cam. But no sound on videos unless you play it back on a VLC player. They should really update the codec for this device. Very annoying to have to find all sorts of work around (ie downloading codec etc) do deal with the no sound issue. 
14360 0 The lens hood interferes with the camera lens by obtrusively vignetting the view and thus the photos. I can t think of any situation in which I would find this product of any value. 
14361 4 FotoTech is great! Great products and service. 
14362 4 Arrived quickly, all the parts advertised were there and I got what I asked for. What more could I want? 
14363 4 Works great, covers all the entry points that I needed 
14364 4 Works perfectly 
14365 4 incredible bag! I can fit 4 film cameras in here, one tlr, one 6x4.5 medium format, one 35mm rangefinder and my 35mm slr! 
14366 4 Wow, this is a fantastic value. Works like it should at 1/5 the price. So far I m very impressed. 
14367 1 I do not recommend this brand. I bought it because they used it at work and while the quality looks okay it goes on and off all the time 
14368 3 Ok 
14369 4 nice --dated now of course but a very nice camera, 
14370 2 Photos are not clear otherwise it is fun 
14371 4 This product is awesome. It works perfectly fine. And the design gives it a better look than the regular slick one. Definitely recommend!!! 
14372 2 Soft at f3.5, more sharp around f8. Still the best APSC fish eye out there. 
14373 4 Works good 
14374 3 on time...worked 
14375 4 Love the way the legs expand and clamp into place. Clamps on the legs work much better than the ones you twist. My old one with the twist mechanism on the legs was forever slipping back down. 
14376 4 I have had limited use so far but I really like it. It holds my d750 very well. For the price you can t beat it. 
14377 0 Mine didn t work. I feel like these were overstocks with batteries long dead. No amount of charging time made any difference. On the plus side, Amazon refunded my money promptly 
14378 4 Takes good pictures, makes a good second camera 
14379 2 I got the first version.. Great but magnets fall out and it s annoying.. Can t seem to find a way to fix it 
14380 1 Very small and it broke within weeks. 
14381 4 works great 
14382 4 Great heavy duty mount 
14383 4 Great! 
14384 1 Seems too small. 
14385 3 Very good. 
14386 1 I don t understand Japanese/ no english directions to be read, nor pictorial instructions. I have returned the camera to Essex for credit card credit. 
14387 3 Met every expectation... Couldn t be happier with results 
14388 4 Fits, as one would expect 
14389 4 Wonderful! Charged quickly and last longer than the batteries that came with the camera, well done! 
14390 2 This cam works pretty well. The video quality is average but the price is right for a decent outdoor cam. Unfortunately I had 2 of these fail. They just stopped working completely. Pyle customer service was great and got me a new camera within a week. 
14391 4 I congratulate them for their excellent speed 
14392 3 I like it. 
14393 4 Costs more but is the perfect fit for your 50mm f1.8 STM -- and it reverses perfectly to fit into the camera bag -- cheap ones don t do that reliably. It also protects the lens front element with no optical impact. 
14394 4 Fast delivery. Batteries work as advertised 
14395 4 I purchased this video camera as a gift for my daughter. She loved it. 
14396 4 Amazing camera (love it!!), fast delivery and great customer service! 
14397 4 Battery is exact replacement needed, Excellent price and service. Recommend it for anyone who needs a batter for the SONY. 
14398 0 it did not look like what picture shows , in the picture it has the thing for attach to tripot but one I received dose not has one you need to change the picture or send same thing as picture shows 
14399 4 No surprises. Everything as expected. 
14400 3 No problems. Works as expected. 
14401 1 It didn t fit my Samsung NX2000 like it said it should it was way too small. Also They didn t refund my whole amount of money they just refunded me $6 out of the $17 I paid. The case was very nice just wish it fit my camera. Bummed!!! 
14402 4 Came just as it looks. Vert sturdy. Love it! 
14403 4 Most completely satisfied including the price. Just right in every respect! 
14404 2 Nice colors -- thick substantial float 
14405 4 Great gimbal head for the price ! 
14406 4 Works well. I like the build quality. Easily screws onto my lens without binding. 
14407 1 I gave up as it was too hard to hook up with comcast 
14408 1 battery contacts are intermittent -- I think I can fix it, but at first I thought it was DOA 
14409 4 Works as expected. 
14410 4 Much nicer than the G1W. Setup is easy and does its job well. 
14411 4 Perfect for what I NEEDED it for. I absolutely love it. Works great.....Fast Shipping. 
14412 4 Good buy！Arrived on time. Works with no issues. Set up pretty quickly and haven t had any problems so far. Excellent baby monitor！ 
14413 2 Expensive but decent lens. Good for beginner. 
14414 0 The Camera works fine. However, Fuji download software is out of date and I cannot download pictures to my windows 10 software on my computer. I have contacted Fuji about this matter 
14415 4 I got these on Prime Day at a great price. I ve used them a few times and they work great! I ve taken some awesome photos with them. They fit perfectly in my amateur home studio. 
14416 4 Bought these for backup for my wife s Canon camera. They worked great. Held charge as long as the original. 
14417 4 This so small ... yet so cute!!! Works great!!! 
14418 4 great 
14419 2 Flies well, but so light that wind will take it as it goes above the trees. Easy to control unless windy 
14420 4 Good stuff 
14421 2 The octopus stand broke upon unpacking. I recommend sanding down the parts so they have better grip/friction. 
14422 4 Excellent product. Arrived quickly through Prime program. Well packaged. Worth the extra price over the generics, which I have tried & found to be worth what I paid for them, i.e. not much. 
14423 3 Batteries have lasted in this unit over a moth now in pouring rain for a month here in FL as still going good. Would recommend 
14424 2 It s not bad for the price, however, this was purchased before I fully conceded to the fact that in order to get a good solid tripod you ve got to spend some money. 
14425 4 cvi quality is awesome can zoom in with the right cameras. 
14426 4 awesome grip! 
14427 1 Was great..... And then it fell apart. I could tell it wasn t that sturdy and I m a little frustrated that it didn t last more than three gigs. 
14428 1 Lens cover gets scratched very easily. Great price though. 
14429 4 Works great! No issues communicating with my D600. 
14430 4 The kit itself is amazing comes with everything an amateur GoPro photographer would want. Anyway, very satisfied with this kit!For me 5 stars definitely. 
14431 2 Work good, easy to set up. The quality of the video could be better and the user interface isn t the easiest to use but all in all it s ok. 
14432 4 Purchased for a trip we took to St.Croix. It was perfect for the flight and sightseeing around the island. Loved it! 
14433 0 The s mirrors are useless. They constantly move even though I strapped them very tight to the handlebar and also tightened the small bolt that holds the unit together. 
14434 4 perfect fit, had it on for awhile and i forget it is even on there. 
14435 4 Well built cameras work well 
14436 4 I received the new item pretty quickly and in fine working order. 
14437 3 Great product. Only con I have with this is the tightening of the ball joint can be tight as it will go and still move in some positions. (Depends on how steep an angle you are at). Otherwise, great for smaller cameras ie: Mobius cam. 
14438 4 Love this filter and it has helped a lot with my travel photography. Fits perfectly. You do have to be careful because it can get stuck, but you just have to make sure you are twisting the filter and not the lens. Highly recommend. 
14439 3 works great 
14440 3 I have not taken any serious photos with this lense yet. It seems to be very good at the very least. I did my research on this and this lens is recommended over the 10-24 Nikon lense. http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/10-24mm.htm 
14441 4 Great 
14442 4 Super cute and pretty easy to use! 
14443 4 Came on time and we used it for an important magazine shoot, awesome 
14444 4 Great product and prompt shipment! Thanks!! 
14445 3 Cheap and weird. Holds to the camera and lens well enough, but latch is sloppy. One screw interferes with the lens and had to be removed, and another screw broke off completely. Good machining quality and price, but be prepared to rework it a little to fit your lens. 
14446 4 Item as described, fits on the new speedlite I just purchased. 
14447 4 They work and are a big upgrade from the previous extension tubes that I had which did not allow for auto focus to work. 
14448 4 It works. I have bene using it for about a week now. The color makes it easier to find if you lose it in the water. 
14449 3 does what it does, cheap plastic but it s cheap cost too, works well. 
14450 4 Everything works perfectly love this product! 
14451 4 Love these cloths. I use them for my reader glasses, PC screen, and expensive camera lenses. They do a great job! 
14452 2 Kind of cheaply built but will do the trick and priced right 
14453 4 I love these flashes!! 
14454 4 Great! Very pleased! 
14455 4 Great sturdy bag, 
14456 4 Looks great and is very well made 
14457 4 Works as advertised and the compact tripod is a travel favorite for me. 
14458 4 Perfect!!! 
14459 0 i was really excited to use this, but it came broken. I changed the batteries three times and nothing. 
14460 4 This had all the items i need. I love to take pictures, and selfies with fam are difficult. NOT ANYMORE 
14461 4 Works great 
14462 4 Great accessory 
14463 4 Just opened my package, and am very satisfied with my new camera bag! Fits the camera perfectly, along with plenty of room for my charger, SD cards, and my new USB cable. Very pleased with this purchase! 
14464 4 Fast shipping and quality product. 
14465 4 Excellent!!! 
14466 4 Fantastic product. Brilliant lens. Very pleased with the results. 
14467 4 Very good for the price 
14468 4 Fast delivery. Product is as described. 
14469 4 No quite as easy to set up as &#34;plug and play&#34; depending on your modem, but once it is set up, this is a good product. The picture quality isn t bad, and the night views are pretty good. Easily accessed through the Foscam App on my smart phone. 
14470 3 It does work. It does not make your lens a macro lens but allows it to focus at a closer distance. 
14471 4 Great security system with a many features and backed by outstanding technical support. 
14472 4 Love this camera! I m able to check on my little one anytime. There is a bit of a delay but not terrible. 
14473 3 My first flash kit for my first DSLR camera. Easy to operate and produces excellent flash photos. 
14474 4 Worth the price 
14475 3 Case is nice and helps protect my daughters camera. 
14476 4 Stronger and bigger than other ones that I ve bought. Hopefully, this one will not crack soon. 
14477 4 Great quality better then I expected and very functional while still protecting my camera. 
14478 4 I bought these for my husbands birthday and he is a bit concerned that they will not be good for long range viewing.....anyone have input on this please? 
14479 4 Just as described--and just what I needed--with perfect shipping! Thanks so much! 
14480 4 Excelent product 
14481 4 It does exactly what it says it will, it fits the vast majority of filter sizes, and it s not irritatingly bulky. Arrived promptly, and seems quite study, especially considering the price point. So far, so good. 
14482 3 It does the job. It s lightweight and feels flimsy, and doesn t have the best tactile feedback for the button... but for the price, what do you expect? Works fine with my Pentax K-50. 
14483 3 Necessary if using GoPro in water! 
14484 4 Very happy with this camera and all of the extras that came with it. Great value for the price. 
14485 1 Not the greatest 
14486 3 It works for what I needed. Fits in the bag I bought. 
14487 4 Great camera! Got this for a trip to Key Largo. Beautiful video. We dove to about 40 feet with no issues. Pictures are &#34;okay&#34; under water, but video is great. Wish it was a 2 inch screen, but the 1.5 inch does the job. Easy to use and operate. 
14488 2 The release lever has troubles and the aperture ring isn t so smooth, but it s workable. 
14489 4 Precisely what I wanted. 
14490 4 1. Super simple to set up 2. Love the wide angle lens, captures my entire apt 3. Very small, can fit anywhere 
14491 4 Exactly as advertised. It works fine. Received it sooner than expected. No concerns. 
14492 4 Item is as good as offered ... Thanks 
14493 4 I love this camera! Love the wifi feature! Very handy when wanting to instantly post your excelllent photos! Arrive in great time! 
14494 4 Works exactly as described,very easy to setup.i will buy it again. 
14495 4 Perfect, even sturdier than the original! 
14496 4 Everything you could want, plus more. Very happy with purchase! 
14497 1 Cord is too short... 
14498 4 Beautifully crafted accessory that greatly enhances the hold-ability of the camera. Makes one handed shooting so easy! Cannot imagine the camera without it. 
14499 4 Everything I could need for my new camera. 
14500 4 Works perfectly for my needs. If you have a professional camera that weighs a few pounds I would recommend you brace this stand a little. 
14501 3 Good camera. Lots of features. A little flimsy. 
14502 3 WORKS GREAT!! 
14503 4 Got this to use my Nikon mount Lensbaby on my Fujifilm X-T1. I was honestly surprised at how well made it is. For the price, I was expecting something that felt pretty cheap, but this is a solid piece of gear. Love it. 
14504 4 GoPro better watch out! I have used both now and this $50 Geekpro is more user friendly and with the screen, who needs WiFi. I have shown this to others and all will buy Geekpro from here on. 
14505 4 Very cool 
14506 1 Their firmware updating and process is crap. Software outdated. 
14507 4 Great piece for camera, thank you 
14508 0 I have a Nikon 5300 and this doesn t come close to fitting. Pretty disappointing. 
14509 4 Easy for my children to use while snorkeling and pictures came out very nice. 
14510 4 This fits great and saved me lots of money. Since I ll probably lose it again, I m glad I know where to find a sturdy replacement! 
14511 4 Great product, great price, fast shipper. 
14512 4 A must have 
14513 4 This is a great slide and negative scanner. I needed to scan 240 negatives that I wanted to digitize and put on a CD. This unit was easy to use and I was able to complete the job in about an hour. 
14514 4 It works like it is suppose to... Great! 
14515 4 Good stuff fast shipping 
14516 3 ok 
14517 0 One attachment worked. Nine wouldn t attach to the GoPro because the slots didn t line up. I must have gotten a bad batch. 
14518 4 got this for my 3 year old great nephew and he is in love with it, now he doesn t need to use my camera, he really enjoys taking pictures, made a perfect birthday present 
14519 3 My concern was the battery and after 2 months, it s still almost full even with the sensor on outside the gate. Setup was easy and fast. Connections are good. 
14520 4 Working great 
14521 4 Not bad! 
14522 4 As Advertised. 
14523 4 love it , awesome for my cropped body camera 35mm lens acts as 50mm lens .I am using on D5300. i needed 50mm so purchased 35mm. 
14524 4 got this on prime day for my dad. takes great pictures in all level of light. very easy to use. for about same price as a point and shoot camera, this one tops with more features and controls 
14525 4 Works great. I wish it would lock out of the way better (when not using the filter), but otherwise works just as expected. 
14526 2 I do like the size of this camera very much but it just doesn t perform nearly as well as my other Nikon but then my other Nikon is in a whole another category price wise. Over all it s an okay camera. 
14527 4 It s my first camera and it is so cool. 
14528 0 I received the camera and didn t open right away cause it was a gift. When it was opened it didn t work. Still haven t heard back from them. 
14529 4 This is the best strap I have owned. It is secure, and very fast/easy to use. Keeps the camera handy and mounts to the proper mounting lug on the camera. 
14530 0 DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE. 
14531 4 Fast shipping, great product! 
14532 4 there is nothing else like it, perfect 
14533 4 as described 
14534 4 Too awesome. Must HAVE! !! 
14535 4 Takes good pictures. Perfect for trips where one does not want to take a full size camera. Ideal for vacations and complimentary to photos taken on smart phones 
14536 0 don t really stay on the visor, depends how thick your visor is... not working on mine. 
14537 4 Makes macro shots with these cameras even better 
14538 4 Good ribbon cable! 
14539 4 Very nice. 
14540 4 This case worked perfect for my GoPro 3+ 
14541 1 The products that I did receive work great, but the body mount and extension pole were not included. 
14542 4 Awesome little camera. I like the features and definitely the price. Need to practice a little with the app and order back up batteries for my longer motorcycle rides. 
14543 3 Thanks! 
14544 4 Great lens in great shape 
14545 3 This is a great camera. The product arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Unfortunately it broke after the first set of film. Trying to figure out how to fix it or if I should just buy another one. 
14546 4 Work Great Hold better than original cannon lens cover 
14547 4 This was a fantastic deal for an exceptional camera. I m absolutely thrilled to have this. I highly recommend taking advantage of this deal before they run out!!!! 
14548 4 Didn t get a chance to use it but after all the alarms I checked, this is the only one that resets itself and it gets tripped off. A plus for people who go on vacation. 
14549 4 Great, provides protecting for a camera, the only down side is it can t hold extra lens, which is more my fault for not reading the description. I ended up give it to my father, who works outdoors a lot, and he absolutely loves it. 
14550 4 Just what I needed 
14551 4 This camera works really good in the dark. It has amazingly good night vision. I like the size of it and I like how easy it operates. I received this item for a honest review. 
14552 1 Its a nice case but is too small for the Sony RX100M4 even though it is advertised as being for that camera. The camera does not slip easily into the case. Two stars because of the poor fit. 
14553 3 Works great for the camera without battery grip holder and bigger lens but would not buy it if you like to leave those on your camera. 
14554 1 The screws on the light stands broke after the first use and the light bulbs were not as bright as I expected them to be. You get what you pay for I guess. I would ve returned it, but one of them fell over and the light bulb broke. 
14555 4 Good camera system. Simple to install 
14556 4 Item was as described and received quickly 
14557 4 The order arrived in good time. Very pleased. 
14558 4 This is a great product. I felt so safe with it on the camera I even let the young kids use it while we were on the boat! 
14559 3 Perfect size, but a little bulky. Small enough, but big enough to fit batteries, charger and a slot for one SD chip. Wish it had smaller handle option and can remove larger strap option. 
14560 4 work great. good to have. 
14561 4 1 year later and these cameras have become part of our everyday life, being able to see what is going on outside is really nice especially when getting packages delivered! 
14562 4 You gotta be kidding me! This lens is EXCELLENT. Could not be happier. 
14563 4 It s nice and long. The only thing is there is a separate button that you hold to take a photo. I wish it was on the stick itself. Love the extra holder for go pro and other cameras 
14564 0 Package was received opened and reclosed and without the product. 
14565 4 When I finally received the whole kit, it was Great!!! 
14566 4 Exactly as described. Good deal! Works great. Thanks 
14567 4 they seem to hold better than the original battries 
14568 1 Thinking about returning. Don`t like the way it looks when you look into them. 
14569 4 I bought 2 of this. This is perfect for my video projects. I used to carry around with me a heavy one attached to another heavy battery pack. Not anymore! 
14570 4 Very happy with this case. I strapped it to my backpack pads on a week long trip and it protected my new camera and made it accessible for quick shors. Didn t really get on my way, either. Good product. 
14571 2 The umbrella has a very weak metal. it only lasted a few sessions. Somehow the metal twisted in a way I could never untwist again. Broken now. 
14572 3 for budget consumers, this tripod from Ravelli will be the best choice because of its durability and reliability while on the job 
14573 4 very good 
14574 4 Took it on our vacation and lasted as long as the original Canon battery that came with the camera. Good product. 
14575 3 Perfect condition works great. Not exactly like pictured. Newer model 
14576 0 I had to return it 2x for the same problem over the span of 3 days, unreliable. 
14577 0 poor quality it SUCKS!!! 
14578 3 Good as expected 
14579 4 Went right together with no cutting. 2 thumbs up 
14580 2 Product isn t the best quality but it works. 
14581 4 Es muy buen producto 
14582 4 Lovable to use either at home or in a car! Simple but very sufficient to charge. I like cloth, too! 
14583 4 perfect fit 
14584 4 works well 
14585 2 Quite obsolete now, better get a GoPro 
14586 4 As Expected 
14587 3 Fits LCD screen perfectly as described 
14588 3 My Grandchildren our having a great time flying the drone. 
14589 0 mine will not charge any of my 3 batteries. they fit fine in the charging port but they will not charge and no light comes on. what do i do. 
14590 4 Absolutely love this lens!! The photos I have taken came out fantastic! Have a taken quite a few pictures of grandchildren and I must say, this lens makes me look like I really know what I m doing! 
14591 4 seems fine 
14592 4 It s been a great camera. Very easy to use. We really like the zoom. 
14593 4 Very easy to set up and start using right away. Great features and a real value for the price. 
14594 4 Excellent! 
14595 4 Fantastic binocs. Light weight. Easy to use. Focuses up close and far away. Love it! 
14596 3 Arrived on time also came with two minor cracks, based on the reviews i was worried of quality... But shows perfectly 
14597 3 Perfectly functional cleaning cloths, though they seem to be of different types of cloth... 
14598 4 Great item to control tripod lights.. 
14599 4 I was using the macro ring flash, the macro lens and my canon camera for my profesional dentistry practice. Works great, fine quality pictures. Very usefull in my dental office. 
14600 2 I don t think they last that long. 
14601 4 Just one word...Excellent!!! 
14602 4 This tripod is awesome and we have used it on all kinds of terrain from rocks to dirt to inclines and it stays straight and level. Easy to adjust for filming at weird angles. Feels really strong. Heavy to carry. 
14603 4 Iove, love, love it, it is difficult taking photos of glass or shiney pewter. This camera makes it a breeze...replaced my Canon Sureshot! 
14604 4 Deserving of 5 stars 
14605 4 item arrived quickly and product quality exceeded my expectations 
14606 3 It works quite well. I am having an issue getting securely attached to my tripod so it doesn t move on the tripod head. 
14607 2 not as good as I expect. 
14608 4 Works great for my Sony RX100 III camera. Comfortable and easy to use. 
14609 4 finally a replacement charger that has the same features as my last!!! and that too it actually charges faster than my original i think! 
14610 4 All the stuff you need but the man f doesn t provide ... great package at a low price! 
14611 4 what an excellent tripod!!!! 
14612 4 This was a great product for the money and being similar to a go pro but for a fraction of the price. Highly recommend this for starters! 
14613 3 adequate 
14614 4 This power battery grip works great with my Nikon D5500, no problems at all, I can high recommend this grip if you looking for one. 
14615 0 Does not load photos 
14616 4 Satisfied 
14617 1 This was just okay for a quick fix. But I think I should have bought something different. 
14618 4 the best!! 
14619 4 Works as advertised. Great product and haven t had any issues. 
14620 4 Work well and are a good value 
14621 4 This works great for my small digital camera. I ve been able to take my camera with me on outings such as the Dirty Dash and haven t had to worry about damaging the camera. 
14622 1 Too much for something that is an adventure to install ! If you simply MUST have this brand screen protector, then buy TWO. One for the first failure and the second for, hopefully, the successful install ! 
14623 4 Easy to install and nicely built 
14624 0 defective out of the box. the part that attaches to the camera was not assembled properly and didn t align on the camera. had to return so don t know if anything else about it 
14625 1 flimsy design. 
14626 2 I was able to get the moisture spots off the sensor, but the dust and lint was a problem. I used the product as directed, but still saw dust on the sensor even after repeating the cleaning several times. 
14627 4 OMG this is loud! I have it wired into a SmartThings outlet. I made the mistake of testing it inside, and my son was so angry he threw his fork at me. And it seems well built as well - I think it will stand up to the elements. 
14628 4 My second Canon Powershot. Love this camera, so easy to run and all the accessories make it great. Good for novice for experienced photographers. 
14629 1 Batteries don t last. 2 years later, they won t hold their charge at all. SONY batteries purchased before that have continued to hold 100%. 
14630 4 Absolutely adore my camera! 
14631 4 Works great for my d3200 
14632 4 We have used this gopro more than I ever thought we would, we take it everywhere and the pictures are always awesome. I had never used one and I m not tech savvy at all and I had little issue figuring it out, it s worth the money!!!! 
14633 4 The battery does just what is designed for and has performed as expected. 
14634 0 Sorry to say mine didn t work properly. Only one side work. And there is a loud popping static sound on the other side. Maybe somebody else will have better luck but mine was a malfunction I guess. 
14635 4 Works great, but I could have just bought the 10X as this is the only one I ve ever used 
14636 4 Simply indispensable. No more lost or dropped caps 
14637 4 Excelent product 
14638 4 Awesome kit. I ve used everything already - even taken the chest & head mounts jet skiing/ wakeboarding :) Definitely suggest purchasing. 
14639 4 Extends and collapses much easier than the internally wired version. 
14640 4 I love the strap, but it was shipped with an off brand attachment, not the Black Rapid FastenR-3 
14641 4 Love these!! Very hard to set up, called tech support and they did it all for me. Was &#34;online &#34; in about an hour. Great buy. 
14642 4 👌🏽 
14643 4 Great Price 
14644 4 This is a nice lens pouch. For those people griping that the pouch did not fit their lens, try measuring your lens and pick the size that fits it. 
14645 4 Amazing product !!! 
14646 4 Great lens, great service. 
14647 3 Good deal. 
14648 4 Excellent!!!! 
14649 4 Exactly as advertised!!! Quick shipment+++ 
14650 4 Awesome 
14651 4 I use my case for the GoPro 3.0 (in waterproof case) and four batteries and I couldn t be happier. This case is small but holds and protects the essentials. There is room for random small items in the lid pocket too. 
14652 4 Very handy and stylish cold shoe adapter! Use this to mount my Sennheiser MKE600 mic to Zacuto Half Cage. Works flawlessly and once the plastic ratcheting knob replaced by metal knob seems to be the same build quality as Zacuto! 
14653 4 Nice products. 
14654 3 I m very disappointed with the GoPro4 Back. I purchased it and after 1 week, It started freezing and now I cannot use anymore!!! I lost information of my last two adventure running!!!! I really hate it!!!! It freezes every I press the Buttons Mode and Shuttle!!! 
14655 4 Great lens! 
14656 3 I use my camera every day for work and I ve tried a few different brands. None last as long as the original Canon battery, but these come closest. 
14657 3 I have found that when taking pictures with it, it works best on 1 to 2 subjects and only close up. So if that is what you need it for then I would suggest it. It is tricky when you have glasses. It leaves the circle light on them. 
14658 4 ok 
14659 4 Quick link to Vera3. Works well. Highly recommend this. 
14660 4 Using the filter now & it is exactly what I needed. They included a lens cloth & lovely note from the one who runs of the company. I like Tiffen products & will continue to buy them. 
14661 4 the camera is awesome, the jawbone im having trouble with. 
14662 4 Great price 
14663 4 Great kit for starters or intermediates. Great kit for the price. 
14664 4 Great deal. Very pleased with my purchase. 
14665 4 Very happy with the unit....excellent quality, fits all my needs and the price is right! 
14666 4 Great price and quality 
14667 4 Worked out very well for our purposes! 
14668 4 I use these diffusers on my yongnuo 568 flashes and they fit perfectly. I use them outdoors to diffuse the hard flash when I cannot bounce it. Great price as well. 
14669 4 It s great! It has absolutely met our needs of being a small tripod for flexible mounting. 
14670 4 Love this case. Customize the fit with the cubed foam and dividers. 
14671 4 Very good 
14672 4 Well worth the money. 
14673 4 Fantastic price! Love the customizable inside (with velcro partitions). It held a lot more than I expected. 
14674 1 it broke after I used it two times ): 
14675 2 I really need one of these, but I am not smart enough for this particular one. It is not simply plug and play, so to speak. I was in above my head. So, unfortunately, I had to return it. Best of luck to you if you decide to try it. 
14676 4 Bought this kit for my brother so that he would have an extra battery. He was very excited about the mini tripod and ability to charge the battery in his truck. This kit is a Super value and quality product. 
14677 1 The threads were too long for my application (Garmin Virb mounts). Also, the diameter of the threaded portion is too large for Garmin Virb mounts. 
14678 4 It worked and easy to replace the original. 
14679 0 The white trash and ghetto thugs living around me think they are real and that s good enough for me. Combine these with Mr Beams motion sensor lights and you ll be making those unsightly neighbors very uncomfortable and compliant in no time 
14680 3 Fine 
14681 4 It s cute and it helps with taking selifes on the fujififilm instax mini. the color also maches my camera. 
14682 4 The battery fit great! I m very happy with my purchase! And it hardly took any time to get here, great shipping! Thank you 
14683 4 I love this carrying case and I can put all my stuffs here in one 
14684 4 We were very happy with everything, especially the price. Delivery was as promised. Very pleased, would buy again. 
14685 4 Worked great for my canon 6D 
14686 0 I could not connect to the camera. LAN cable to the camera and the PoE power supply then to the router. The light on camera came on but kept getting Log In Failure using the supplied Configure Setup software. Returned the camera. 
14687 2 Camera sucks but flies great. No ability to attach different camera. 
14688 3 very good piece of little majic in Photo & VideoTechnology 
14689 3 Just ok ,four star 
14690 4 All was good - on time and batteries as expected. Price was good - Always need spare batteries when you travel. 
14691 4 Excellent product, very comfortable and very reliable seller 
14692 0 Return it 
14693 4 great 
14694 4 Really sturdy and good for basic camera beeds 
14695 2 It uses your phone s hotspot, and big pictures take a long time. Couldn t keep the connection long enough for it to work. 
14696 4 The batteries lasted a longer time than the ones that came with the camera. They came with a great travel charger. An incredible value for the cost! I received the package in a very timely manner as well. 
14697 4 Glad I purchased this. It really tightened up the focus on all my lenses. Simple to use. Just check your cameras first to see if they have a focus fine adjustment feature. Otherwise this will not help you. 
14698 4 This product works beautifully and made everyone at the birthday party happy. 
14699 1 Very flimsy and poorly constructed. After using it just one time, pieces of it were already chipping off. 
14700 3 A little thin but gorgeous and can t beat the price. Need thicker background underneath to avoid translucency. I just used an older backdrop and it worked perfectly. 
14701 4 I saw on Pinterest many people used this products at their weddings and then couples would write a memory below there picture. It s quick and simple to use and brings you back to the good old days. 
14702 4 Love these! 
14703 1 it was ok but battery didnt last long and cant have it more then 40 feet away 
14704 4 Great cloths 
14705 4 Great fit, no bubbles, so far very good. 
14706 4 Great love it 
14707 4 This is to replace a camera that was stolen from me. This is better than the one that was stolen. I could not be happier with this one. Thank you for a wonderful camera. 
14708 4 Worked perfectly in my FinePix F600EXR 
14709 3 small but nice when you need some extra light. 
14710 4 perfect for photo s thank you 
14711 4 Excellent product 
14712 4 Excellent! Thank you!! 
14713 4 took great picture love them 
14714 3 The strap was too big to hook up to my wife s camera, but I was able to adapt it. Works Great. 
14715 4 Keeps more charge than my actual Canon battery. 
14716 4 Happy with my purchase. 
14717 4 Work great! Other members in our group were envious and wanted one! 
14718 4 Excellent, it does the job! I have take it with me to 3 overseas trips already with no issues 
14719 4 We really like them. Fun for getting closer details on the moon. 
14720 4 its great 
14721 4 It helps to take selfis!!!yayyy!! 
14722 0 didn t work 
14723 2 One charging port does not work. 
14724 4 Good 
14725 4 I ve bought these before they work quite well look good 
14726 3 They don t last as long as the OEM batteries, but with 2 of these in a battery grip, you ll make it through an entire day of shooting with power to spare. Considering the price, I d buy more of these before spending the $ for the OEM battery. 
14727 4 Arrived on time and the quality is pretty good! Highly recommend this product! 
14728 4 Excellent !!! 
14729 4 good product, good price 
14730 4 Great Product!! 
14731 3 Works okay for the money! 
14732 4 Looks great on! Can t wait to use it. 
14733 4 Always need an extra camera battery - this charged quickly and is doing its job! 
14734 0 I just got this today and it is already packaged to be returned. Apart from being junk, the battery was corroded and the film was dated 2002. What???? Save some money and buy a disposable camera, they will work much better. If I could give it zero stars I would. 
14735 3 The lens cap fits fine on my Nikon Coolpix P90 NIKOR 24X 4.4-110.4mm lens. It gets my 4 star solely because it fits OK, hasn t broken, and was cheap. 
14736 4 Two for just a couple $$$ more than the single. Gotta love Amazon. 
14737 0 They were the worse thing I ever bought 
14738 2 Cheap 
14739 4 Iv e been using this on the hot shoe of my d3300 and this flash does great in TTL mode. When autofocus is enabled (and the flash is on the hot shoe) there is a ring laser that shoots forward, can help with low-light autofocus. 
14740 4 I love this camera you have to be pashint that s all 
14741 4 Value and quality!! Great camera for begginers and Pro 👍📷 
14742 3 Pretty much a good value. Fairly complete package, although I am sure that eventually I will be upgrading some of the accessories. 
14743 3 nice product , but it should come with power supply or choice of when buying from this company 
14744 3 Comparatively speaking, this is a great deal on the instax mini film. Best price I have found! Shipped in 2 days with prime. Thus will be my go to film purchase when I need refills for my Fujifilm Hello Kitty Instax Mini! 
14745 4 this is my first prime lens and i really love it, it takes great images and i just love it! if mine broke i would buy it again 
14746 1 ND is divided right in the middle with no adjustment. Causes framing shots nearly in half. 
14747 4 Great second battery! 
14748 4 This is a great system for the price we love it it works perfectly. 
14749 3 A decent lens for beginners-awesome with lots of light 
14750 0 too soft 
14751 4 Product as advertised, shipped promptly and at a reasonable price. 
14752 4 nice 
14753 2 works for what i eeded for a sall price 
14754 4 Superior quality Easy install A great deal for the money 
14755 0 VERY CHEAP MATERIAL ... BATTERIES RUN LOW FAST. NOT WORTH IT. .. LOOKS FAKE ANYWAYS 
14756 4 Thank you for your service, I love the product 
14757 4 Always a good idea to insure your items when you have a thriving business 
14758 4 Good! 
14759 4 as advertised, arrived before expected... nice surprise, THANKS, J 
14760 1 The stand start to get loose in the head after some use. It is not a durable or heavy duty stand. 
14761 4 Couldn t find this cable anywhere. Came quick and works perfectly. Can t beat the price. Great Product. 
14762 4 No Prop lines in the video, love it! 
14763 0 Won t stay on! Keeps falling off! Crappy product! 
14764 4 Awesome camera...... Does everything a gopro does for $350 LESS. 
14765 4 sale as advertised. 
14766 4 Well executed harness. This is my second one.The straps will eventually stretch out but that won t happen for years. 
14767 3 Its hard fort me to give 5 but it works and is what I needed thanks for the good service 
14768 0 It was broken when I received it .so I didn t get a chance to use it 
14769 0 Very cheaply made. 
14770 4 Very realistic. Just what I wanted for now. 
14771 0 Very poor quality. 
14772 4 Great products!!!! Very durable. 
14773 3 Has all the bells and whistles you need. The only drawback is that the shutter is loud. 
14774 4 I was expecting something of low quality for the price. I rarely leave reviews but I m so happy with this things that I need to tell others 
14775 4 Exactly as expected, protects hotshoe, centers with level. 
14776 4 Easy to take pictures or video. Great quality. Good battery life. Highly recommend it. 
14777 4 It works great!! 
14778 4 Perfect, nice and cheap. Arrived faster than expected. 
14779 4 This is not a regular mirror things farther than about 15 feet are tiny. I just want to know when someone is behind me so this works for me. Also, remove plastic cover from mirror 
14780 4 Arrived promptly. Exactly as described. 
14781 4 Met all expectations 
14782 0 Excellent! I loved and it worked very well. 
14783 4 Great tool kit 
14784 4 works perfect with my hero 4 silver. such a great buy as the batteries do run low quickly and having a few backups in my bag makes life perfect 
14785 4 Great product. Images are high quality. Can t complain. 
14786 3 Works good. 
14787 4 Excellent camera. Great price! 
14788 1 Battery doesn t stay charged 
14789 3 WORKS WELL, Satified with the quality for the price. 
14790 4 Physically a little longer than the 35 f2.8 and therefore easier to hold. Becoming one of my favorite lenses. 
14791 3 Nice case. Room for extra battery, card 
14792 0 Useless commodity. Neither battery was chargeable. It s not worth processing for a refund. 
14793 4 Absolutely great. Actually better than I imagined. I am very pleased with the quality of this camera. Pictures and video turn out great. I also had quick follow up with the seller just making sure everything was as expected. 
14794 0 The soil is used contaminated a whole bunch of stuff, send me them! I got really upset. 
14795 4 security system is excellent ,, and I can monitor my des iPhone or tablet, I recommend :) 
14796 4 Great starter camera 
14797 4 These Batteries worked Perfect for my Canon Vixia S20. The charger also in good. The cost vs. Canon s price is like 1/3 the price. 
14798 2 Would have been better if it didn t come broken! 
14799 3 good inexpensive attachment for my Canon telephoto lens to provide protection. 
14800 1 The size of the shield is smaller than the size of the LCD screen 
14801 4 Excellent product! Bought two separate frames twice. Very happy with the purchases.. 
14802 1 Not for heavy cameras. Based on another review I thought it would be sturdy but it is not and you can tell as soon as you feel the box. The monopod part also did not extend as much as I thought it would. Probably okay for casual light use. 
14803 4 Super pretty summery film. Fast delivery great price 
14804 4 Great product! 
14805 3 Works well. And for that price no one can complain. 
14806 4 It has a bit of a rubbery smell but it works quite well! 
14807 3 easy to set up and use 
14808 4 Very good value for the price. 
14809 3 Just what was requested. Thank you. 
14810 3 Charges good, keeps full charge for long time 
14811 2 ok 
14812 4 No issues, works great as per advertised. 
14813 4 couldn t have better. it is great 
14814 2 No grippy Handel just hard plastic feels cheap but gets job done. 
14815 4 Item arrived as promised. 
14816 4 Comfy and stylish 
14817 4 Love it 
14818 3 Gift, reasonable, child is happy. 
14819 3 One of those you get what you pay for. It carries a good amount, durability is the issue. Mine s already ripping at the top handle after 2 mild uses. 
14820 4 Ver y good 
14821 2 needs second pocket. inside pocket of the one opening is too shallow. Discs fall out. Had to buy another to hold my camera. Fortunately the camera was better than the case! Don t buy it unless you are need to have only one thing in it. 
14822 3 Yep, !!! 
14823 4 It s perfect working. 
14824 4 Great Item. Well made. Good stitching. Easy to fill. Nothing to complain again. Used this item to weight down our film lighting stands and they worked a treat. 
14825 4 Charged my old battery for my point and shoot! 
14826 4 Very professional sturdy build. 
14827 0 The camera was not what I thought it would be so the this protection plan was a waste of my money since I do not even use this camera. 
14828 4 Takes videos much better than photos. iPhone beats photo quality for sure 
14829 4 As advertised 
14830 4 Works as advertised and expected of a Nikon product. 
14831 4 Very good quality 
14832 4 I ve only had a couple flights so far, but I m impressed. Very easy to fly and video and camera shot are awesome. It will only get better the more I fly it 
14833 3 Nice light weight. 
14834 4 Works great, great color, easy to use. Highly recommend this product. Be sure to buy the floating straps, too. 
14835 4 I just got the camara today. I love it. It is easy to use. I definitely recommend this camera. 
14836 3 Used this product during our honeymoon. Worked very well and I received the same amount of time on this battery as I did the stock battery. It s very nice to have the 2 extra batteries plus the convenience of mobile charging. 
14837 0 Had to return the main product these accessories, and this seller did not take these back. 
14838 4 Just perfect! 
14839 4 I am so happy with these lights so far. Amazing battery life and a good light output. I definitely wouldn t mind having a few more filters/gels, but for the price I am so happy with the lights. 
14840 4 Wonderful!! Great price!! 
14841 1 No better than the 700TVL cameras that I had before and they were pretty bad especially for night vision 
14842 4 Keeps my go pro safe, and it isn t boring. 
14843 4 Fit my Nikon D200 perfectly. Took a good charge. Does what it says it will do. 
14844 4 very effective, works for me. 
14845 3 good and light 
14846 3 I like these opera glasses. They fulfilled their promised, but I do wish I could have gotten a higher magnification. 
14847 0 Videos come in hkv format. Have to watch full video can t skip thru. 
14848 3 Didn t come with directions, pretty easy to figure out though. Got the job done. 
14849 4 Perfect for taking anywhere where there is an electrical outlet to recharge battery, and spare battery. Never have to worry about no charge in battery, so always have picture taking ability. 
14850 0 I afraid that I bought it so much big to my lens..I mean I didn t read in the product details about the filter size&#62; I use a Nikon and those filter don t fit an any lens that I have....Bad purchase. 
14851 4 Works as advertised. 
14852 4 It worked better then expected 
14853 3 This light is massive produces minimal heat for a CFL. and great to add light to my aloe plants :) 
14854 2 Instructions are horrible 
14855 3 Super cute! Can t wait to do our 6 month pictures with our little man! 
14856 4 This lighting set is working PERFECT for my video blogs. Great product at a great price! 
14857 2 Ok, but a bit stiff and hard to close. 
14858 0 Doesn t work and got no refund. Stay away 
14859 4 Very good product 
14860 4 love it soooo much. 
14861 4 Works perfect love the additional accessories like the tripod and cleaning material and car charger 
14862 4 Not impressed with lens adapter for the add on lenses. No need for the add on flash 
14863 0 Camera fogged in side camera lens during first use. 
14864 4 amazing quality...love it perfectly fits my nikon d3200 
14865 3 Great product for the price. It also came with a portable bag to carry it around. Its very convenient and lightweight. Great for any kind of angles. 
14866 4 Very nice pole... Only thing I recommend is drying it out when doe using on water sports! But besides that great product would recommend 
14867 2 Item was shipped fast but the zoom lens is loose and when holding camera down the lens will slide out and it shouldn t move. Not the seller s fault but a factory problem. Takes good pictures but mechanical flawed. 
14868 0 I bought this with the expectation that I am able to pan my camera for panoramic pictures. The problem is when the ball is locked into place, it also locks the panning mechanism below! You can t rotate the damn thing. Stupid design. 
14869 4 good product and so good seller help me and contact me so fast thank yoooooou 
14870 4 We wanted the loud ringer, and the paging feature was a helpful addition. The 3 watt amp is pretty strong, too. All of the Viking components are easy to configure and wire 
14871 0 Right out of the box, the owner s manual is missing. I m thinking this is a return. I will charge the battery, go online to look for a manual, but if the camera doesn t work, I want a full refund. I m very upset. 
14872 2 You get what you pay for here. Works, but not 100%. 
14873 4 Perfect! 
14874 4 Great! 
14875 1 Not great quality. When shifted, the filter darkness does not cover the entire lens so during long exposures, the lighting is exposed differently across the picture. I suggest buying something more expensive for better quality. 
14876 4 good product 
14877 4 exelent 
14878 4 As advertised. Serves the purpose well. 
14879 2 I m really impressed with the camera itself the range of motion is great, and the picture quality is amazing for such and inexpensive camera. Where the product fails is the app it crashes constantly it seems to have a really hard time staying connected to the unit. 
14880 4 good deal! 
14881 4 For an amateur, this works great. Easy to set up and fast. 
14882 3 They work wonderfly when you re using them but trying to fold them up and put them back into the protective sleave is a pain. Otherwise it s a nice product to have. 
14883 0 No, it does not meet my expectations. I need to return. 
14884 3 I have not had the time to try all of the capabilities of the Nikon D3200 digital camera, but so far have found it easy to use and adaptable, resulting in excellent pictures. 
14885 4 Those li-42B are great. 
14886 2 This is a tripod. It s a pretty decent inexpensive tripod, and if that s what you need, I say order it. But if you need a light stand ... this won t do. 
14887 3 The case is nice but it is a bit hard to get the micro cards to stay in the foam. However, it got me to Africa and back and kept the cards clean and dry. 
14888 4 Very light and portable,folds up to a nice carrying size.Also sturdy enough to use outside.highly recommended 
14889 4 Meets all expectations 
14890 4 Good 
14891 2 Bought this last minute for a cruise. Takes pretty good pictures, zoom feature is excellent, but the time needed between pics is inconvenient. However, as a basic camera it does the job. 
14892 4 attractive case and fits great in my center console 
14893 1 The cameras are good and with the POE (power over ethernet) it makes running the wire much more simple. The downfall is the controller and HDD, it constantly needs reformat and will not overwrite the current recordings. 
14894 4 Great image quality. Tricky to get set up but customer service has been very helpful with getting things set correctly. 
14895 0 Showed up only one side charges. 
14896 3 Good for Linear systems. This remote will NOT work with Genie Garage door openers. 
14897 4 Excellent product. Stable, smooth and easy to use! 
14898 4 On time and as described. Very pleased with seller and item. 
14899 4 An actual Panasonic battery wow 
14900 2 Not the best 
14901 4 This Item was the same item that I had for my camera, no difference from the charger that come with the camera. The delivery was fast with no problems at all. I would recommend this company. 
14902 2 One of the two soft buttons (the black) has some &#34;other&#34; additional mark on the surface....which I don t like....the quality is much better in the photograph... 
14903 0 Did not have a universal fit like it describes. My Cool pics and Easyshare didn t fit. I returned for my money. 
14904 4 CHARGES FROM MY 20 WATT SOAR PANEL KEEPS BATTERY S FULL WHEN I M OUT ALL DAY SHOOTING PICS 
14905 3 Good price. They just go way to quickly especially when using the wifi. I have 6 batteries in constant rotation to have any fun making vids. Dual charger is a must have as well... 
14906 4 Love this camera you can zoom in and say stuff through mic 
14907 0 Smudge on the lens that I couldn t get off. Took a few pictures...all blurred. 
14908 4 This adapter works well. A bit on the expensive side, but I can now use my existing 58 mm filters. Easy peasy to install. 
14909 4 These work great in the Polaroid printer camera, just know they do not have sticky backs so you ll need tape. 
14910 4 It was just what I needed, and shipping time was great, got it before our trip. Price included a battery, so I can charge one and have it ready and waiting, no need to wait the the other one to charge. 
14911 4 Beautiful pictures, easy to set up, am going to give one to my daughter for Christmas this year! 
14912 4 Henry was very quick in fixing my problem accessing my camera through my android. Thank you very much for taking the time to correct this. 
14913 4 Adorable , came earlier than package had said &#60;3 
14914 4 Works as advertised. Pretty light weight. Pretty rugged. I used it backpacking and thought it was worth the weight. Just something fun to have to look at peaks and stars. Don t expect to discover any new planets with it. 
14915 4 Great service and product 
14916 4 Great price, good product. 
14917 4 The Smallrig is perfect cold shoe mount for field applications of mics 
14918 4 good combo 
14919 4 A perfect alternative to the expensive Fuji battery and charger. The charger works fine and I have noticed no difference in battery life in the camera. Very pleased with this purchase. 
14920 4 The swith was handy and decent at switching devices to a default. Now my TV with one HDMI port can have three HDMI devices attached. 
14921 4 This mount works perfectly for its intended purpose. It saved me buying another camera. It made it possible to view 2 sides of my house. I was able to utilize the full pan & tilt feature of outdoor camera. 
14922 4 Batteries are good, charger works fine and I received immediate phone support regarding a question. 
14923 4 My laptop charger took crap. This replacement worked perfect. Quick shipping and good price. 
14924 4 I finally got to play around with this. It is an amazing microscope for simple everyday hobbyists. I thought I would encounter a problem when I upgraded to Windows 10 but the drivers work fine. The drivers are downloadable from the Plugable technologies website. 
14925 2 For the price, you d think you would get more fly time. Oh technology limitations. It s a battery. It works. 
14926 4 Nice additIon to my go pro system....now no more charging in the camera! 
14927 3 Works great. Good image quality! 
14928 4 was happy to be able to get one for a very old flash unit. 
14929 4 The battery arrived in good condition and promptly. Once fully charged it worked as expected. No issues. 
14930 4 Fabulous lens. Works very well in all focal lengths and apertures so far after 600 shots. This will be my favorite matched combo with the Rebel 1 - T5. Until I check out the T6-x. 
14931 1 Flimsy and overly complicated design (the amount of pieces that extend. There is really no suitable purpose for these. I wish i could return them. 
14932 4 Works wonderfully and fits all my GoPro accessories. 
14933 4 works great - keeps the camera from sinking 
14934 4 ♫ ♪ ♫ A Pleasure ♫ ♪ ♫ tucksmusicstore.com 
14935 4 I like this one better than the Neewer Camera Tripod Mounting PLate with Quick Release that was all black. This one fits tighter. 
14936 4 As soon as I got my ROXANT PRO video camera stabilizer, I tried it with a smaller camera (Sony RX100 = 240 g) and it worked great. Your product is unbelievably sturdy and well designed for a really great price. Please keep me posted on future technical breakthroughs. 
14937 2 The 2 way audio works...the setup was not very easy. IPCam Viewer App does not have this model IP Camera for the smart phone. 
14938 4 Not only is this a great product, their customer service is top notch. I have already recommended this to other people. If you have any issues getting this connected reach out to them and they will certainly help out. Don t look any further. Buy it! 
14939 4 Very pleased with item. It arrived quickly and is perfect for the camera.. 
14940 4 fine 
14941 2 clunky interface 
14942 4 Great case. No real downfalls. Be up and flying in minutes. iPad slots could be a tad wider because I keep them in cases to protect screen and they are snug 
14943 0 Received and it was broken 
14944 2 It works but the red tip is hard to put on and I wish it was smaller. I know there is a smaller one but the smaller one did not get good reviews. 
14945 4 Great product and perfect transaction. 
14946 4 We love the camera strap! 
14947 4 I m satisfied. Great seller.. Thank you 
14948 0 Does not fit my factory Gopro case or the aftermarket case i purchased. totally useless junk. 
14949 4 Good price, fast shipping, durable product. 
14950 4 Must have for GoPro Hero owners. GoPro should have included it with the Hero. 
14951 4 Works like a charm 
14952 4 The item is as described by the seller -- be sure to attach the adaptor before the lens covers - I had to play with it a little to get it to work, but these are definitely for the Canon PowerShot SX50. All in alln a good deal. 
14953 4 Great camera the only thing I didnt like was going from water to surface and the amount of time it took to get the lens clear so the picture wasn t blurry 
14954 0 It s not good :( I m not happy i open it it s toooooo small not great quality recording and pictures are worse i don t know how to get a refund but I wish I could :( 
14955 4 Best camera I have ever used! 
14956 2 Does the job but it shakes a lot and can get uncomfortable against your ear. Hence the 3 star 
14957 3 they were better than I actually expected them to be 
14958 4 Really nice, sharp lens. Great price for a good piece! 
14959 4 as expected 
14960 2 It does what is expected. 
14961 2 Gift 
14962 4 Nice little polarizer, makes a big difference when shooting water or sky. 
14963 4 Awesome camera 
14964 1 Kind of plastic-y. Not impressed. 
14965 4 I really liked using the Bobber on my go pro while snorkeling. One funny thing I did notice is that when out of the water bees and other insects were certainly attracted to the yellow color of the bobber. 
14966 3 works wonderfully i would recommend this version of the GoPro over the fancy versions with the LCD viewer and WiFi just as rugged without the added cost 
14967 4 We were looking for a good bridge camera to go with our long lens DSLRs. This camera is great...perfect for landscapes. Images are crisp and beautiful, it s easy to use, and compact. A great buy!!! A must for vacation. 
14968 3 its light, easy to setup, easy to store, and holds a background up. 
14969 4 Really comfortable and useful strap. 
14970 0 I wouldn t recommend. It definitely doesn t work for what I want. EXTREMELY limited focus. You truly get what you pay for. The only upside, packaging was great and it did arrive quickly. 
14971 4 Great tool, does exactly what it is supposed to do, amazing build quality. I tied mine onto the pull of my GoPro case, so I always know where it is. Adventure on.... 
14972 4 Happy with product. Just as described. 
14973 4 Bobber is doing good job. You don t have to put water inside like some people advice - is perfect balanced. 
14974 4 Nice job, Amazon! Plenty of compartments and padding for all of my accessories. 
14975 4 Thx 
14976 4 Product as expect! Fast shipping! 
14977 4 best binoculars I have ever owned 
14978 3 This is all you need for your Go Pro Spare battery and charging kit. 
14979 4 Wow its amazing and my daughter is happy happy 
14980 4 Great quality and compact product. 
14981 0 I thought I was getting a good deal for B+W 72mm UV filter but when it arrived, it was a used one. It had finger prints and a dry sugary substance (ad if someone spilled soda on it) very disappointed. Going to stick with purchasing my filters from B&H Photo 
14982 4 Everything was awesome!! Delivery was amazing!! Wouldn t have bought it any other way and I totally recommend others to get their GoPro this way as well!! Thank you! 
14983 4 Excellent, thank you... 
14984 4 Great microscope, I use it to photo coins for sale and it takes great closeups. 
14985 4 Great value. They are better than original. 
14986 4 Arrived early and works great on my Sony A77ii, what more could I want. Very happy. 
14987 4 A+ 
14988 4 Nice hood, well constructed and good fit. 
14989 4 Superb lens. I ve been using this on my Nikon for over a year in all types of situations (indoor, outdoor, fast action, macro, etc.) 
14990 2 Never have been able to get it to work. What s the secret? 
14991 4 👌🏻 
14992 4 Great telescope, easy to assemble and set up, great views of the moon. Haven t tried planets yet. My first real scope. Tremendous service from Orion for suggested accessories. 
14993 4 Love it! It s everything I expected! 
14994 4 Excellent 
14995 1 No matter the settings, I cannot seem to get a clear picture when inside. I bought this so I didn t need my large camera on me all the time. Disappointed. 
14996 3 Got it as a replacement. it works nicely. 
14997 4 Good connectivity and price. 
14998 3 works good 
14999 4 This case is better then I expected!! Very cool!! I added the DJI logo, looks even better!! 
15000 1 Too small to fit compact camera Cannon Power Shot SX710HS (it is a really small case) 
15001 4 This battery fit my camera perfectly and charged beautifully in the battery charger that I also bought, 
15002 2 The plastic sheet protectors seemed loose before use. Decided to return. 
15003 4 Absolutely love this camera. It has a lot of cool features!!! 
15004 3 Good recorder for the price 
15005 4 2nd Nikon binocular I bought. These were less money than first and we are just as satisfied. 
15006 4 ok 
15007 4 Quick shipping, quick connexion to bluetooth & compatible with Iphone 5! 
15008 4 Just what we need for our trip. 
15009 4 Outstanding camera! Easy setup! Love it! Will buy a couple more! 
15010 2 i used it with my phone and it s works ok 
15011 0 When turn on camera need to pull battery out and back in for camera to work 
15012 3 It does the Job just right good price vale 
15013 4 Nothing works like to original. Great battery pack. No short charge issues like those found on some clones. 
15014 4 Works perfect i could not complain at all 
15015 3 It does the macro job! focusing is quite challenging though. 
15016 4 It s perfect! 
15017 3 It stopped the jellow on my phantom 2. So I m satisfied 
15018 4 My husband and I were looking to buy a GoPro when we came across this bundle and we are happy we did. Being able to get a lot of accessories for a few dollars more was great. We cannot wait to create memories with this amazing bundle. 
15019 4 Great product. 
15020 4 Works great! 
15021 4 Great product, fits perfectly in my lens 
15022 4 Nice design and excellent construction. Works great with my Zoom H5 portable recorder too. 
15023 3 So far all of the accessories work as expected EXCEPT for the selfie stick. It s horrible quality and will not hold your GoPro without rotating around. Trash the selfie stick and buy a better one if you really need one (I didn t). 
15024 3 Pretty good buy. Gets the job done for the most part. 
15025 4 I like it! 
15026 3 Love my camera backpack took it to Costa Rica and was perfect for traveling!! 
15027 0 This tripod is not up to my expectations too short and unstable but for the money I guess it s all right 
15028 4 Great photos and video, arrived in two days. Would highly recommend this product and would highly recommend amazon. 
15029 2 It s okay, some pictures came out great. Others looked like webcam quality. Sucks up batteries though. Bring lots of batteries. 
15030 1 its ok 
15031 1 It was free and I still wouldn t use it. I hope no one actually pays for this. 
15032 4 Great packaging and product was what I expected. Great value. 
15033 4 Great for my project 
15034 3 too expensive... 
15035 2 I wanted to return this because the sound quality is so poor that there is constant background noise even in complete silent rooms. Other then that it s great but with sound so terrible I felt as if the device was broken. 
15036 2 Came on time, battery however does not sit in it correctly but seems to be charging. 
15037 4 Excellent upgrade!!! 
15038 4 Excellent.. very well made with all the storage and pockets needed.. 
15039 4 Tina Gonzalez was excellent in helping me set up my cameras - she was awesome!!!!!! 
15040 4 Excellent method to attach a Loupe to the 5DSR. Very well made and do like the lift up and swing away capability to move the Loupe without removing it from the camera. 
15041 3 I had to get a second strap in order to be able to have a strap around my neck while using the camera. So far that means there are 2 straps on the camera and I haven t figured out a better way. Otherwise, I am happy with it. 
15042 4 Works as promised. 
15043 4 The lens performed superbly, with very sharp pictures. In good light, the f/4 aperture provided excellent performance for short exposures with action sharply stopped. A wonderful purchase! 
15044 4 i like the camera...still in the process of learning about the camera but I do like that both video and photos can be taken I also like the large megapixels as well as it being able to hold a larger SD card. 
15045 1 It s bad quality and can t see for my cellphone or internet... 
15046 2 Its a little on the cheap side but it has some nice compartments which seem a little flimsy though. Not bad for the price. 
15047 4 perfect. 
15048 3 Good 
15049 3 Great lightweight tripod! 
15050 2 Okay quality, batteries last about 50-75% as long as OEM. 
15051 2 The batteries were not the 1450 mAh brand pictured, but 1200 mAh Bower batteries. Both are good batteries, and both last longer than the Canon OEM 1000 mAh battery that came with the PowerShot S95. 
15052 4 thank you 
15053 1 I got electric shocks each time I touch 
15054 4 Works great. No problems at all. Jim 
15055 4 great back pack for my camera and camera stuff 
15056 4 Awesome !!! 
15057 4 It arrived earlier than predicted and works great. I have no complaints about it. 
15058 4 This camera is breath of fresh air. Amazing zoom, easy to use because its just like my Samsung Galaxy 4. Wifi so you can instantly email or post on facebook, shutterfly etc. 
15059 4 Great 
15060 4 Henry at tech support was great in setting up the camera. Awesome customer service. 
15061 2 Like that it s manual focus with built in hood. Seems sharp for the price. I just don t like the limited aperture stops. 
15062 4 My first Big lens! very Very Happy!! 
15063 4 Worked perfect with my camera. 
15064 2 The cords for the lights are very short. The lights are top heavy and one fell over and broke the bulb on the 2nd use :-(. 
15065 2 Scanner was fine. I thought in reading the description it was an upgraded version. I already had one like the one I ordered. 
15066 2 It fits my hybrid bike bar, and it holds OK. However, it doesnt t fir my road bike bar. 
15067 4 Makes a big difference in my images. Easy to use. 
15068 4 For the money this reflects really does the job! I use it all the time in my photography classes! Gold and Silver is a great combination! 
15069 4 excelente 
15070 4 Arrived on time. Have used a couple of times and quality of material and function are very good. 
15071 4 Beautiful idea, design and quality manufacturing. Works as expected and makes holding the camera with one hand a pleasure. 
15072 4 This is an awesome product. It holds on windows and non porous surfaces. 
15073 4 Love it! 
15074 4 Love this! Very comfortable. 
15075 4 I was looking for a very tall mono-pod. I found it to be a little shaky when extended to full length. Still, works good and I will continue to use it. 
15076 4 Lost my genuine Nikon TTL cord at an event, and sorely missed it. Doubtful, I gave this a whirl, and it s perfect! Arrived next day! 
15077 4 great 
15078 0 Terrible product. Worked only 3 times and never again. Do not waste your money in this crap 
15079 4 Purchased two speedlights with a YN560-TX. The results are superb. It took me a while to get them set up correctly to start taking pictures off camera, since i m new to flash photography. This a must buy. Will update later after i ve done more testing 
15080 4 Another product that is WAY overpriced, but exactly what us video guys need. It s aluminum foil people. 
15081 4 Worked as expected 
15082 4 Excellent set of binoculars. They are better than expected! 
15083 4 Perfect match for the SIRUI P-326 6 section monopod. Easy to set up and adjust the friction resistance to suit ones needs. 
15084 4 Great quality for the price. No qualms about recommending this product. 
15085 4 I did very good pictures, i love it. 
15086 4 Really enjoy this easy to use camera! 
15087 4 Very fast shipping. New Product as described. Works very well. 
15088 1 Fits the copter, controller and charger great. No room for blades, tablet or other equipment. 
15089 4 Great buy 
15090 4 We have used our camera a handful of times and have even satisfied with the quality. I have yet to buy lithium batteries but I will be doing so. The regular AAA batteries are completely dead after only a half hour. 
15091 4 Definitely met my expectations! 
15092 4 Excellent product. 
15093 4 This camera is awesome - lots of features, is nice and compact making it easy to carry. 
15094 0 I got the accessories yesterday, when I open it, there is no connection with the selfie stick, I cannot use it for connecting with waterproof case. 
15095 4 great cams! WARNING.. If you use &#34;blue iris&#34; for your security system do not update the firmware on these. the last firmware (as of 8/20/2015) will not break the streaming to the software. However the cameras still work with other software. Also Infrared Leds could use better range...... 
15096 0 Doesn t even deserved 1 star.... Terrible, horrible, stupid app that will never connect to WIFI even when completing all steps multiple times your camera will appear offline on the app while the connection light is green. Without the app working this camera is useless... Never again.... 
15097 4 Love everything about this camcorder. The quality, the zoom, the auto focus, the stability feature.. its just amazing. only slight problem is that the battery pack sticks out. 
15098 4 Nicely made, looks good, supple and easy to use. 
15099 3 Works well, lightweight, compact, storage case. The top bar bends a little, but that s to be expected from an adjustable bar. 
15100 4 nice product 
15101 4 Great tiny camera. Great value for money 
15102 2 the caps don t stay on well, come off easily when bumped. the lens hood was alright, kind of a pain to line up nice though to shade. 
15103 4 the best 
15104 4 It works great and no one see s it lol 
15105 4 Came in excellent quality. 
15106 4 wonderful product 
15107 3 Great lighter weight 35mm camera. Excellent photo quality with the function to email a photo to anyone with a computer or phone. Photo correction program although limited has a good editing program. Great lense selection of which I have five. 
15108 4 These batteries work just as the GoPro one does! Charges well and leaves the battery fully charged 
15109 3 The description states that this contains a lithium metal battery. It actually contains a sealed lead acid battery. 
15110 4 good grip 
15111 4 As I expected 
15112 4 small, functional, works great, price is right. I did not do any research before buying it, but really happy with this mic. 
15113 4 Great product... 
15114 4 I had to call it in to get help and set it up with my mobile hot spot. The rep that helped me, Terry Morgan, was extremely helpful and walked me through the entire process. I m very happy with the product. 
15115 4 Perfect for glasses 
15116 4 Loved this lens and the bundle was great! Shipping was crazy fast too. I would definitely order from them again. 
15117 3 A good product. 
15118 3 Great light, works as advertised. However the battery backing pops out easily if you re not careful. Not the worst problem to have all things considered though. Great for getting a little extra fill light on indie film sets where time and resources are limited. 
15119 4 Worked very well and there are no problems with using them with the J5. Amazing price for three batteries. 
15120 4 Get teased for using a selfie stick! But seriously, this thing is solidly constructed and is great to get overhead shots in a crowd, and also really low shots (think skateboard videos that track along a few inches from the ground). 
15121 4 Works great 
15122 4 Just got, Have used it a little already taken a lot more pictures than my old one would have and still has 2 dots left. Thanks and the price was good also. 
15123 4 This is a very comfortable, great looking camera strap. It fits my camera perfectly. Very well made. 
15124 4 great for my needs when needed works well and very pleased. Thanks!! 
15125 4 I love the bluetooth shutter remote. Everything else is in great shape and works just fine. 
15126 1 Low quality 
15127 4 I love this sling, bought it prior to a trip to Disney World and this made it much easier to use my camera. 
15128 4 It works! Cap is good to protect camera lens while transporting and storing. Lens hood didn’t eliminate propeller shadow but definitely reduced it. Lightweight so does not effect gimbal balance. Overall, I’m happy with my purchase. 
15129 4 Great Quality - we recommend this item! 
15130 4 three thumbs up. 
15131 4 Works as intended! 
15132 4 excellent product. 
15133 3 Very good. The angle for the camera needs to be better though. Have to wear them funky to get the camera straight in front of you. Make sure to get vlc media player or the correct codecs or whatnot for the avi file. 
15134 4 Perfect replacement for the mount that went bad. 
15135 4 Perfect 
15136 2 VERY LARGE The camera is incredibly conspicuous, although pretty to look at – if it doesn t need to be subtle are hidden in anyway it should work well – my bad for ordering without considering that issue. Two large to hide amongst bric-a-brac at Cetera as I had hoped 
15137 1 camera does not seem to be working as it should according to the instructions,kindly have someone from amazon give me a call and walk me through setting up camera and getting it to work properly. 
15138 3 Came fast works as advertised. 
15139 4 Lttle stabilizer than can make a large difference. 
15140 4 We love the camera and the accessories as well :-) 
15141 4 Really nice reflector/diffuser! Very easy to use and does a great job. The design is great and very easy to hold and use with one hand. 
15142 4 Works perfectly and shipped faster than expected 
15143 4 perfect piece of equipment. 
15144 4 Super high quality. Pitched my wobbly old clamp lights straight into the recycling bin. 
15145 4 very nice product 
15146 4 Excellent purchase. Worked like a charm! Glad I bought it. 
15147 0 The product came with the brand name &#34;Camson&#34; written in front, it was not in the sample photos, I do not like how it looks. 
15148 4 A perfect fit and very fast service. 
15149 4 So far so good. I love that the lens can be tethered to e lens/camera so I don t have to hold onto it separately. 
15150 4 Excellent 
15151 4 Great price for a beginner photographer. 
15152 4 great 
15153 4 Inexpensive, works perfect. 
15154 4 This is a really affordable package when you break a light and need some replacements. I bought these as soon as one broke. Much better to buy in a package than to buy them singular. 
15155 3 Everything worked as expected. I would purchase again. 
15156 0 Case leaked while in Florida. 
15157 4 Bueno 
15158 2 The clip is good. Some angles are funky. It doesnt bend the whole 180 degrees so you cant get all the angles. Slips off of hard serfaces. Best use is on a backpack strap 
15159 4 Nice head strap, somehow stays cooler than its cheaper imitators. Get it so you can be a miner with a camera on your head. you know you always wanted to play miner..lol 
15160 4 Went all over Europe in my pocket. Over 6000 great pix. 
15161 1 Disappointed in the quality. Thought it would be leather. No plastic protectors , had to purchase them my self. WAY overpriced!!!!!!!!!!! 
15162 3 Works great and as described. Interesting that I didn t receive a wall charger for it though. Only a car charger? That s the only reason for a 4 star. No wall charger. 
15163 4 A great battery for my Tough 4 camera which I love! 
15164 4 Very happy 
15165 4 I was pleasantly surprised. The bag is bigger than I thought and therefore holds more equipment. It arrived rather quickly and more than met my expectations. It is a nice bag and well worth the money. T hank you. 
15166 4 Love this little bag but it was too small for my sons camera and lenses, so I had to return it. It is very well made, has little compartments and I recommend it highly for smaller cameras. 
15167 1 Useless. Unable to pan or tilt smoothly.. 
15168 4 Couldn t be happier!!! This thing is solid, and awesome! 
15169 4 Super fast shipping! I lost my original lens cap to a lake and this baby did the trick! The cleaning pen is awesome as is everything else in the package. For the price and quality, don t hesitate to click and buy NOW! 
15170 0 Do not waste your money-broke almost immediately on landing after third day flying. I would say I am a medium level drone operator and this product was poor. I own 5 drones, so take it from me, not worth the savings. 
15171 4 Works perfect, And fast shipping! 
15172 4 Case is as advertised. Wouldn t hesitate to buy from them again 
15173 3 They re a bit fragile but they can do the work, I use them to hold my reflectors and bounce cards. I like the tips because you can flip them over to adjust the grip. 
15174 3 Very comfortable. Item as described. 
15175 4 I bought this package for my daughter and she LOVES it. Great color case - my grandmother s favorite color - always loved it. Great gift idea to go with the scamera in the same color. 
15176 4 Incredible lens! 
15177 4 Fits my T3i camera body, 2 lens, and my speedlite. 
15178 4 I love working with ND filters and these give me a bit more to work with. They seem like good quality for the price, they may not be for professionals, but for me, I am very happy with them. 
15179 3 They work as advertised and working good and great products 
15180 4 Grest product 
15181 4 Hot Shoe Cover hits perfectly for my Sony a6000. 
15182 4 Installs pretty easily and has great picture. It s pretty cool to be able to check on my house when I m away. 
15183 4 Just as I expected. 
15184 3 Great product looks like it can hold and stand the test of time. 
15185 4 Very convenient and having no extra cords is a plus! 
15186 4 Absolutely am thrilled with such a good secondary battery for my T5. It holds a charge like a champ and hasn t caused me any issues on my all day shoots. Definitely recommend this battery if you want a good substitute or replacement battery for your Canon Rebel. 
15187 4 The best I have ever used! 
15188 4 keeps my need safe and secure, nice product for many needs. Thanks!! 
15189 4 Just right for my camera and &#34;stuff&#34; and at a great price. 
15190 4 works great. 
15191 2 Works fine but more instructions needed, like how to clear info. On chip. Does send out a lot of false alarms. Still trying to figure out why. 
15192 3 Works well. the cover/protectors are a nice value-add 
15193 4 Wow, this makes your GoPro look like a real camera. Its a little heavy. Really protects you camera. I got 37mm filter kit for it, works like a charm. 
15194 4 Like it it works great 
15195 4 Everything arrived ok! Great product. 
15196 3 Rad 
15197 3 Cheap, compact, takes decent video. Not giving 5 stars, because the battery capacity is terrible, and the battery fits entirely inside the cam, meaning larger aftermarket batteries are not possible. 
15198 4 Great product, as usual from SmallRig. Just what I wanted, and exactly as advertised. I have built many custom rigs, and SmallRig is rapidly becoming my favorite source. My clients are always impressed with the quality. 
15199 0 Poorly written instructions and doesn t work as advertised. 
15200 4 These filters are fantastic! Makes my pictures look as if I knew what I was doing. 
15201 4 I was looking for a battery for my Samsung film camera that I forgotten about since the dawn of the digital camera. The price of this rechargeable lithium battery is about the price of a single non rechargeable one. No brainer for this one. 
15202 4 perfect for my coupons 
15203 0 Cheaply made and put together! The pieces of it don t even fit together so the led light emits from EVERYWHERE drawing attention to it and even annoying the wearer in darker environments. Stay away! 
15204 4 Amazing quality, shipped on time, I love them! 
15205 3 Works for me! 
15206 4 Great camera 
15207 1 Sounds quality was not as good as expected. Video quality wasnt very good either 
15208 4 Might be overkill to use this for a &#34;tough&#34; camera but it s rigid and can hold the battery charger and extra batteries, which is all you really need when vacationing. 
15209 4 Thank You 
15210 4 Works just as described! Exactly what we needed. Thank you! 
15211 4 Great product 
15212 3 I really like the ability to attach the tripod mount below this makes it very friendly to use. 
15213 4 Item as described. 
15214 4 Great color and size. It can be used as a normal purse... Cute! 
15215 1 Tips over easy 
15216 4 Good information in a nice hand held system. Would recommend it to any photo buff with a D7100. 
15217 4 I don t know what its made of but it works great. 
15218 4 Perfect! 
15219 4 This lens take amazing photos. Produces a very wide, highly detailed and proportionally correct image every time. Simply outstanding!! 
15220 4 Excellent camera for the money. I his is my third Canon. I have a 35 mm and an eos rebel. I like the compact size and color only one lens 
15221 1 Color is very poor in Auto mode. I ll have to delve into the documentation to see if there is a fix. 
15222 0 poor colors, al photos have a green screen with this papers… bad choice 
15223 4 Really awesome product. 
15224 3 I had tough time hooking this up. I called customer service and got Marvin on the line. Badge # AR004221, he was great, he walked us through it with patience. thanks Marvin! 
15225 4 Fits and works great with my Fuji finepix S1 Camera. 
15226 3 battery is faulty, we thought it was a problem with the olympus camera,however it is not and I still need a battery that works? 
15227 3 Works great. Time will tell how durable it is. 
15228 4 Thanks! 
15229 4 awesome bundle 
15230 4 A great set. My daughter loves and and is having so much fun using it. Thank you! 
15231 3 Good lense. Excellent results. Glad I got it. 
15232 3 Good camera. Haven t really used it other than few pics 
15233 4 Great mounting bracket?!?! Lol. 
15234 3 Good 
15235 0 Umbrella hole is too small for my 43&#34; Westcott Umbrella. 
15236 4 Exactly what I wanted. Camera stores don t normally carry screw-on caps. 
15237 4 Good design overall! Excellent videos made 
15238 4 Perfect fit for my husbands drone. Very lightweight yet very sturdy. 
15239 0 It s basically impossible to make this camera/feed work consistently. It is unbelievably frustrating and a waste of money. 
15240 0 This watch is supposed to be water resistant but water got into watch after a few months of use, now it s filled with water and not usable. 
15241 4 I gave Digital Goja 5 stars on my Altura flash kit! I am very pleased with my purchase, the price and the follow up Customer Service. Awesome! 
15242 4 love it!! 
15243 4 Perfect 
15244 4 Excellent quality - love this lens 
15245 0 Cheap - Don t buy this! 
15246 3 Quick, easy setup, very useful product. I can peek at my cell phone from anywhere and see what s going on at home. I highly recommend! 
15247 4 Received promptly, fits my camera just fine, price was right, I m very pleased. 
15248 4 Audio quality is not good like camera but over all. Good 
15249 1 Both batteries no longer work and I have only had them almost 5 months. I had pictures scheduled and had to cancel because I charged both batteries and neither worked.. 
15250 4 Delivered on time and as described 
15251 4 Nice fit with smooth finish. Doesn t seem like it ll fall off or peel away anytime soon. The low profile makes it hard to tell that it s even there. Clear glass doesn t negatively affect image quality at all. Good product! 
15252 4 They ARE &#34;Wireless&#34;....But they don t run on Batteries! (WOW) - Of course they need a PLUG to have &#34;Power from Electricity&#34;! These ARE &#34;MONITORS&#34;...Not secret SPY CAMERAS!! (LOL) 
15253 4 Olympus batteries are the best for the Olympus cameras 
15254 4 Since I got my GoPro 4, I ve bought quite a few filters & junk. Out of everything this is one of my favorites! 
15255 3 Seems to work well. Used it to top-off my batteries and it charged-up quickly. Time will tell, but good so far. 
15256 4 Perfect. 
15257 2 Charger is fine but disappointed by the size of the batteries. Movie Cameras need bigger batteries and this was advertised for movie cameras. Better to buy the charger and batteries separately. 
15258 4 This is a great device that allows you to view things going on in or around your home from a remote location. It has a lot of the features of a CCTV system, but for a fraction of the cost. 
15259 4 fits cannon rebel well 
15260 4 great transaction. Product as described 
15261 4 was excatly as described. 
15262 0 The remote battery seems to be dead. It does not work. 
15263 4 Worked fine 
15264 2 Having trouble getting adequate focus for my eyes 
15265 4 works great! 
15266 1 Did not fit my Canon 5D Mk III with the stock 24-70mm. No battery grip. Decent build quality, but could not use. 
15267 4 very good on batteries, recommended 
15268 4 Benjamin Ward Excellent product and technical support. Would recommend. 
15269 4 Works great 
15270 4 Exactly what I wanted, and it works well. Convenient also that it can be reversed on the lens for storage in my camera bag. The on-board surface helps in reducing eliminating glare inside and outside the hood. 
15271 4 Perfect camera. 
15272 2 It works fine...good cost compared to others out there. Not a big fan of the BLUE strap but it works and easily replaced if need be. 
15273 4 It s doing what it s supposed to at a great price! 
15274 4 A great lens that I use on my Nikon d750. If you like a heavy, large lens this is the one for you. Photos are outstanding. Most pleased, by clearly if you want something light and small you may want to look elsewhere. 
15275 4 easy to install and add to sell phone nice you can look inside your home from your sell phone 
15276 3 it s a re-purchase 
15277 3 Good quality regardless of zoom setting 
15278 3 I really like the camera, but can t get the pictures off of it onto my laptop. And I don t know how to use the items that came with it...cause no manual came with it. 
15279 2 This projector is really good for the price and is easy to travel around with however i didnt recieve and hdmi cord to connect the projector to my computer and i dont like that,now i dont know which cord to buy 
15280 4 for this Price i was waiting almost a toy.. But are a Really GOOD product. i can compare this set with set of 35 us. 
15281 0 Didn t come with instruction booklet, but that was easy enough to find online. Doesn t hold charge, and randomly shuts of my phone. Don t waste your money. 
15282 4 Worked very well. Definitely needed the charger and extra batteries. 
15283 4 So far this along with VIDEO SURVEILLANCE SECURITY SIGNS Sign burglar- robber- thief video warning... has kept intruders from attempting to break into the back door of our garage. 
15284 4 Excellent camera but the speaker has some static. 
15285 1 It is not fitting to my d5300. 
15286 4 Great price and great item 
15287 4 They charge fast and work great. 
15288 4 I bought this camera ages ago - not sure why I wasn t asked to post a review then... :) Anyways, it s a good piece and I ve only had to invest towards getting the SD card compartment. 
15289 4 By reading the instructions before anything else, my first film worked great. I haven t finished my first film pack yet but so far it s worked just how it should. I m actually going to buy again after finishing this pack. 
15290 4 Excelente! 
15291 0 Only received 50 shots. Two of the 20-pack and one of the 10-pack. The clear packaging even says &#34;50 shots&#34; but they placed their own sticker over the top which says &#34;60 shots&#34;. Not cool. 
15292 4 It works. 
15293 4 So many fun facts noted in this book. 
15294 4 I am very happy with this battery :) 
15295 4 Good cable. Just as expected. 
15296 4 My wife really loved this camera! 
15297 0 Read the instructions upon arrival, you are directed to an icloud account to change camera settings, whereas the competition includes the software to monitor and change settings without the cloud account. I am sure it performs well, 115 degrees vs 126 by the competition. 
15298 4 The tripod is perfect for my needs. Compact and pretty sturdy considering its size. 
15299 4 Just as described 
15300 4 Very good product. 
15301 4 Does nice job. 
15302 4 This was plug-n-play with my NVR. Good picture on the test. I will update if that changes in actual operations. 
15303 4 Great! 
15304 4 these work too 
15305 4 REALLY GOOD, INCREDIBLY EASY TO FLY 
15306 4 Arrived on time and as described 
15307 3 Not like I had read but seller was great and a full return 
15308 4 good product 
15309 4 Fast service, simple! 
15310 2 battery does not last long enough 
15311 4 This is a definite must if you walk much with a heavy camera. This sling allows you to grab and shoot, never having to remove the sling. I use it at flying events and its perfect. 
15312 4 Works great. No problems. 
15313 4 Works as it should. 
15314 4 Excellent 
15315 4 Bought this with an extra 50mm lens. Love it so far. The extras that came with this bundle was like icing on the cake. Really happy with my purchase. 
15316 2 Flash is great but wireless adapter doesn t transmit TTL so it s useless. I couldn t even get my camera to trigger with it. 
15317 4 Love the cameras (3) of them. The picture is amazing. Vincent was amazing at his job and vary patient and professional. Thasnk you for your product. 
15318 4 Great product! 
15319 3 Really great for the price.. 
15320 0 Confirmed, bought this from Frys.com and had the exact same experience. It s unforgivable since I needed this for a special occasion and now I m hosed. 
15321 4 Very useful for my situation: OMD EM5 body plus ep3 body with 40-150 and a few primes: 75/45/25/14. The top compartment carries my headphone wallet and stuffs. Stylish outlook. 
15322 4 it iss exactly what i expected 
15323 4 Perfect for the C11. 
15324 4 very good 
15325 3 With Foscam support set up was fast. This is my 4th Foscam and I like the picture Quality of all of them except for the outdoor Infrared is hard to clearly see anything. 
15326 4 Smooth transaction. A+++. Thanks!!! 
15327 0 Horible I didnt get all the sheets. 
15328 4 great deal 
15329 4 works fine on pentax. would buy again 
15330 4 Very complete kit and everything I needed to get started 
15331 4 I love this lens. Amazing sharpness, great quality build. My new favorite lens. I ll buy another. 
15332 4 So far so good. They charged properly and work just fine in my D3200, 
15333 4 Great value, love it. 
15334 4 Great product. Works fine with different branded flashes I own and my Sony A7ii as receivers 
15335 4 Seem to work just as good as the Go Pro batteries but are MUCH CHEAPER 
15336 4 Absof****kinglutey awesome. the batteries stay for many many hours of research. i personally talked with the manufacturer and he was more than happy to help with my questions about integrating the array into my system already! 
15337 4 Perfect fit 
15338 4 Awesome 
15339 4 Fast service. Great price. Great product. Could not find anywhere in our town. Thank you 
15340 3 I really like the look and feel of this case. It isn t a perfect fit, there is a bit of room in the case, but with the screw at the bottom it holds nice and tight. 
15341 3 It is a good tripod. It s not as sturdy as it should be, a little too light weight. But overall, a decent purchase. 
15342 4 great product 
15343 4 I love this camera! I have a bigger digital camera but this is much easier to use. Digital zoom and can work with one hand. Bought this for a cruise where we can only use fixed lens. 
15344 4 Stand was great and very easy to put up and break down. Would definitely purchase for future backdrops again! 
15345 3 When used with various Lowepro bags and their utility belt, this is a great way to distribute weight and reduce the strain on my shoulders (already an issue with two Nikon DSLRs). 
15346 0 Actually it gets no stars! Am returning it shortly. Can load no photos from any source! 
15347 4 Good bundle and lots of extras included. Camera is great. Phots could be larger. 
15348 4 easy to install and do the job... 
15349 3 Good cameras and I did drawback does not have a particular site cameras for surveillance of mobile 
15350 4 Easy to install. Very good product! It works Very well! No regrets!! 
15351 4 Exceeded my expectations. Literally plug-and-play and very easy to set up. No frustration at all. I was up and running before my wife finished cooking dinner. 
15352 2 The animal frames are actually longer than pictured, and the circle frames are too big for the film, so the polaroids would actually fall out... The frames look equally sized in this picture, but they re not in real life. Cute frames, but not super high quality. 
15353 3 Nice unit. Was easy to program the Radio and Access. Keep in mind this doesn t support rolling codes. 
15354 4 Very high quality and compares perfectly to the Canon version. Adds noticeable weight to the camera, but not in a bad way. 
15355 3 This is a little snug for our camera but it does work. 
15356 4 Its awsome 
15357 4 Works perfect, you don t have to worry about your phone drowning! 
15358 4 good 
15359 4 really love it 
15360 4 These disks work miracles when shooting outdoors, it really helps get softer light when you don t have helping hands! 
15361 4 Well made piece 
15362 4 what power 
15363 0 Not for phantom 3 as described 
15364 4 Wonderful purchase...speedy delivery! 
15365 4 Great Kit 
15366 4 Fit in my camera nicely. Would recommend to a friend. 
15367 3 Lens is great. Cover arrived damaged, one of the latches was broken. 
15368 4 Very good product Works perfectly. I use it almost everywhere I go. Stunning video quality And just a fraction of the price of a GoPro. Can t beat it!! 
15369 1 Going back! Could not get the unit to recognize the transformer after numerous battery changes and 4 adults trying to program it. 
15370 3 The remote works fine. It s cheap built but works. The only problem was the manual that came with it belongs to a different unit. 
15371 4 Fits perfect 
15372 4 Incredible lens for the price! 
15373 4 Great price for 2 basic reflector umbrellas 
15374 3 great product fast delivery 
15375 0 This filter does not fit my camera, a Canon PowerShot SX530 HS. My mistake? 
15376 2 Believe item does not show sufficient authenticity. Would flashing light indicator help? Present location of camera is not in well lit area. This probably a deficiency. 
15377 4 These work great! 
15378 4 It really is 50 inches long, It is very light weight and will hold a phone perfectly. Won t tip over it can adjust it to loom up but not down. This is a great tripod for a amazing price! Definitely buy this tripod! 
15379 4 This has the quality you would expect from a Canon lens. Built solid and works great! 
15380 4 fits everything and the extras too ! 
15381 4 This tripod is very sturdy. I was caught up in a windstorm and the tripod and camera blew down. No damage to the tripod. Very easy to adjust and seconds to unpack and set up. 
15382 4 Good and portable 
15383 3 This is the second one I ve bought. They are great to take on location, easily packed with other film gear, very compact and it does the job of holding various size flexfills. 
15384 4 Great price love it feels very professional 
15385 4 As described. 
15386 0 junk! had bought a pair similar to this at BB years ago and they worked great (lost them)......these are just junk....never worked at all 
15387 4 Is perfect 
15388 4 This item allowed me to use 12 old filters from another camera, at a great price. 
15389 4 For the price you can t beat these binoculars. Not a big fan of the eye piece, still trying to find a set of shade out cups for a better fit and less glare. The clarity is good, adjustment is easy. For the price they are awesome. 
15390 2 As described but not the best 
15391 2 Works fine with GoPro. Feels cheaper and lower quality than real GoPro batteries. 
15392 4 Exactly what I wanted at a great price! 
15393 4 Easy to install and the position of holes to align the adjusting screws are accurate. 
15394 3 Works as advertised. Not sure what I can say about it. 
15395 2 As advertised. 
15396 4 I bought this as a gift to compliment the GoPro Black which I bought for a friend. He loves it and will use it on his trip. 
15397 4 Great person, I hope you live forever 
15398 4 Works as expected with the Nikon D750! 
15399 3 Awesome! 
15400 1 Cute design but it ripped in half already after me just opening it for the first time... :( 
15401 3 Great flash for the price 
15402 4 ok 
15403 4 This is a great system for doing close up photography. Very versatile and I ve been getting fantastic results, Highly recommended! 
15404 3 Good quality camera that is plug and play on the Swann 7200 series recorders. Night vision is very good, with a reasonable infrared LED array. Day vision is outstanding with good color and good balance between light and dark (shadows). 
15405 4 Nice little tool for the GoPro, very handy. 
15406 4 Backpack is holding up well. I put a dji phantom 3 drone inside with accessories along with go pro and point and shoot. Everything fits well and is protected. Good quality pack, very comfortable to wear. 
15407 4 Great deal. All of these are great quality, and worked perfectly. Packaged really nice as well, the case is an added bonus. 
15408 3 Love it! Ita a bit weird looking when not zoomed especially with a visible frame shot. Macro part works great. Cool carry bag. 
15409 4 It s perfect and really liked it. 
15410 4 Recommend this product 
15411 2 For the price the camera can t be beat. Performed as expected and the accessories which Listed as 90 minutes get about 60 min out of it.came with it work seamless. 
15412 4 its ok 
15413 4 Very good no problem for me 
15414 0 Garbage, does not do anything it is supposed to do, especially take video. 
15415 2 Love got it for my step daughters bday it was a hit does everything she needs it to do! Got here late and I paid extra for two day was my only knock 
15416 4 These are great. They let me use less expensive 3rd party batteries.. 
15417 3 good product for the price 
15418 4 Essential. I much prefer the two handled model. 
15419 4 Works great! It has almost 3-5 seconds delay on the relay mode and it is black and white at night. 
15420 3 I find this cam suitable for my purposes. I found the connection from wall outlet to camera, and to camera to USB to transfer recordings tedious,but other than that,good for the price. 
15421 4 Quicks ship, great service, both items work great. 
15422 0 This item s color is NOT what is pictured. It s really really orange, not brown at all. 
15423 4 Fit my Nikon 52MM AF and AFS lenses perfectly. it is always a good Idea to keep a few of these on hand and at the price you would be foolish not to 
15424 4 Nice product! 
15425 4 The bag is very spacious, camera isn t very stable, but everything else is secure. I would purchase this item again if I had to. 
15426 4 Perfect replacement for the lens caps that I seem to set down and forget everywhere I go! 
15427 4 Works better than my old higher priced item. I like that it uses simple AA batteries also. 
15428 3 There are some scratches. But It is a good price. 
15429 3 Works well with my older analog PTZ cameras. 
15430 0 This battery is a lemon. I bought it for photographing my trip to Europe and it simply did not work. When I charge it .. The indicator shows it s fully charged in a few minutes , however when I put it in the camera it s dead. Serious letdown. 
15431 4 This have worked out great. I ve had them for about six months now and they re in great condition. Definitely a great price for such and excellent product 
15432 2 Too noisey 
15433 4 Great for astrophotography. 
15434 4 Great product 
15435 4 Prompt delivery. Superb product. 
15436 4 Love this lens! This and my 55mm f/1.8G are my favorite and most used! 
15437 0 Does not work. 
15438 2 This worked great at first, but the mask was uncomfortable after the second or third use. I developed a knot and a bruise between my eyes and couldn t use it half the time on my diving trip.Not worth the $50 in my opinion. 
15439 2 Gift 
15440 4 Great bundle. I ve used most of the mounts from this and have had zero issues. 
15441 4 Twice the life of the standard battery of my hf400. 
15442 3 great 
15443 4 Love it and a lot less that Canon 
15444 4 fast shipping and just as described. Fit perfectly thanks 
15445 0 Won t Auto-focus with the Tamron 70-200 2.8 on D5200 works with 55-300 albeit very poorly. 
15446 0 It broke right away and we cannot return it... ITs junk.. 
15447 4 Fantanstic 
15448 4 LoveIt. I can video a whole wedding none stop! 
15449 4 Very nice, high quality and crystal clear. They work great. You can buy these with confidence in the Vivitar name. 
15450 2 Batteries just don t hold charge very long. 
15451 2 good 
15452 0 I was unable to get this due to coupon code issues wish this program recognized that 
15453 4 Gets the job done. Perfect for a amateur like me. 
15454 4 Works great at a better price than GoPro... 
15455 4 They work well. 
15456 4 2 additional years for less than the already low $19.99 they charge? Sign me up. It s a no brainer that if you get a Pentax you get the extended coverage. No complaints. 
15457 3 My camera fits perfectly. Haven t had it under water though. Tough and durable. 
15458 3 I like it as I longed for this one, but it is tad tight when put it on. I had to be extra careful when putting it on and taking it off. 
15459 4 It holds up well to the Nikon brand. I have been very pleased. 
15460 4 Very nice camera, very easy to set up, clear picture, I recommend if you purchase to spend the time to familiarize yourself with the settings. Also you install a 64gb micro SD card instead of a 32gb card. The phone app works really good for this camera. 
15461 3 Tripod is actually very stable and well built. Holds my Canon EOS 70D with minimal effort, I can, for example, shoot time lapses and have no issues. Overall it s a good product and it comes for a decent price. 
15462 3 performs as expected, good quality 
15463 0 One of the engines broke 
15464 4 Nice camera! It takes beautiful pictures. 
15465 4 Works well 
15466 4 worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks. 
15467 4 Worth my money!!! 😊😊 
15468 3 Works great but mostly displays in black & white in low light conditions indoors. 
15469 1 weak that all 
15470 3 hands free video recording 
15471 1 Eats batteries 
15472 4 like it 
15473 3 Great lens and arrived quickly too. Fit my Olympus perfectly! 
15474 3 It works as advertised. I don t like that the battery only lasts about 45 minutes. Oh well, it was made cheaply and in China. Nevertheless, it serves my needs. 
15475 0 IT DOES NOT FIT IN THE CF SLOT OF THE NIKON D4 BUT IT WORKS IN NIKON D3 
15476 4 Awesome! We use them as baby monitors in addition to an Angel Care monitor and love them!!! 
15477 4 Excellent quality and perfect fit, really helpful in my last beach vacations! 
15478 4 cute borders! and they aren t flimsy. happy with my purchase 
15479 4 Does what a polarizer is supposed to do 
15480 4 One of the accessory the go pro need 
15481 2 Works 
15482 3 I haven t used it long enough to really know it s reliability but, it was at a great price, it shipped quickly and with no hassle. 
15483 3 Worked good. Inexpensive. 
15484 4 Excellent quality, highly recommended 
15485 4 Works great. Very affordable. 
15486 4 This case is very sturdy and the pockets are ideal not only for GoPro accessories but for other cameras as well. The net zipper pocket can hold a lot of stuff as well! I highly recommend this case! 
15487 4 I like it and good for the price too 
15488 3 Perfectly adequate CPL. No detectable loss of sharpness. but some graduated loss of brightness. I recommend multiple exposures at different rotations to see the results. 
15489 4 sturdy, good quality and a decent camera bag, can fit flashes and well organize 
15490 4 This is one of the best filters on the market. The threading is cut beautifully so I do not get that grinding feeling when taking it on and off like I do with other brands. Coating is flawless. No splotches or inconsistencies like some other MultiCoat UV filters. 
15491 0 Terrible customer support. Extremely difficult to setup. 
15492 4 Works great. 
15493 4 Works well and it has a car charger, which my original one did not have. 
15494 4 The P900 has far exceeded my expectations!i use it literally everyday. I have taken over 3000 pictures since getting this camera and can t believe the quality and capability of this camera! I take pictures of the moon everyday as well as the sunrise/sunset. Couldn t be happier! 
15495 1 Okay fit and finish, but the scale starts from the wrong end! Only really useful if the scale starts from the center of the camera, so that numbers are transferable to other setups. 
15496 4 4 hours recording and am out of 64Gig memory and still have just under half the battery remaining. Baddest batteries on the planet!! 
15497 4 Good camera, as I expected! 
15498 4 Just as described. Works great on my Canon 5Dmkiii. 
15499 4 This is a well packaged collection of must have tools to keep all aspects of your camera clean. Love the carrying case since it allows me to get everything together and it does not take up much space in my camera bag. 
15500 3 Nice case but save yourself some money and go to Harbor Freight. Exact same case is $25 or less there. 
15501 2 Not bad... Attachments were all too loose to hold gopro in on position but if you leave the bolts in the attachments very tight, it should bend the fittings very so slightly and make it work. And nothing is stainless so think twice about getting anything wet 
15502 4 I had the tough job of organizing my parent s photos. This book was perfect. I ended up buying several because they had so many photos. But for the price, these are very nice photo albums. 
15503 3 seems to attach correcto to nikon g lenses the manual aperture ring it is not so good as in a nikon manual lens good as comparison of other cheaper brands, not excelent 
15504 4 I am OBSESSED!!!!! 
15505 2 A little bit big for the Speedlight SB-500, you have to push it hard to fit well so does not falls 
15506 4 Love this product. Now I have three batteries for my GoPro and never run out on a trip. 
15507 4 Awesome and works great!!! Super fast shipping! 
15508 4 Filter works good, Gets the job done and protects my lenses.,also the vendor was great. 
15509 4 Very good 
15510 2 Nikon P610 Charges with this cable which is what I really needed it for, but does not work for data transfer. Would be nice if it worked to download pictures but at least it got my camera functional again for cheap. 
15511 4 As promised, works fine. 
15512 4 Speed! This lets you fire one after another on your speedlites/flashes. No more changing out the batteries every 10 minutes on your speedlites. Doesn t fit 430 EX II 
15513 4 I have no problems with the Syma X8W. I am just a horrible pilot. It is fun to play with. 
15514 4 I love this camera. I ve owned a lot of Nikon cameras in my life and this beats them hands down. Great camera! 
15515 0 Images are skewed or cut off, will not shuffle photos properly 
15516 4 Fits my 6d perfectly. Looks even better on it than the original piece. Great purchase. 
15517 3 Very Nice product but does not work in low light if thats what your looking for. Simple to use! 
15518 0 It did not work when it came in. 
15519 4 Works very well. Very pleased. 
15520 4 I lost my previous set of filters I had purchased at a camera shop. These are the same make and quality at a much better price, and easier than hassling the drive and parking. 
15521 4 Awesome security system! no problems at all. good for the price as well. I have recommended to several family members as they wanted one for them home. 
15522 4 Amazing lens - I was using the kit lens prior on my FS100 and holy cow this made a huge difference. If you are debating on wether this is the lens to get for a true 35mm on your E mount camera - go for it. 
15523 4 Item is as described. Reasonably priced. Well packaged. Completely satisfied and works as advertised. 
15524 0 Not very useful, it covers the wheel button to where it is very difficult to use it. It doesn t really provide that much protection either. 
15525 4 Very nicely made & easy to adjust & use. Olympus tough cameras are heavier than gopros but I tried it walking and with the stability system in the camera it seems to be just fine. Working up the courage to take it surfing..... 
15526 0 Printer won t connect to my android phone what can I do. It won t let me enter the default password. I ve even reset/restarted the printer and my phone but still doesn t work. Can t rate right now if product isn t working. Need some help 
15527 4 lenes works as well I thought it would 
15528 2 Very good picture and works well. Reliability is an issue. One out of five I purchased was DOA. Another one died after a little more than a year. 
15529 4 I was very upset when I left my extra camera battery and charger behind on vacation. I thought getting replacements would be expensive. I found this on Amazon for a great price. It works just fine and you can t beat this price! 
15530 4 Fast delivery very happy 
15531 4 I purchased this item for a friend who is extremely happy with this quality product. 
15532 3 Nice camera. Fairly easy to navigate, decent imaging, raw photos. I took photos of the moon and with breathtaking results. Zoom works great. 
15533 4 Exactly as described. Was surprised this was actually the go pro brand when I got it. Woked great when I jumped off the rock in Hawaii. 
15534 4 Small, perfect for a GoPro. Even fits in my padded GoPro case. It s a small Tripod so read the dimensions before ordering. 
15535 4 Great!!! 
15536 4 have two nice & smooth holds well with pentax k5 & sigma 150&500mm lens& grip 
15537 4 great 
15538 4 A very light weight option for when you are not fighting the elements. Works great on a selfie stick. 
15539 4 Does just what I wanted it to do, protect the camera. 
15540 4 Portable, easy to use, does the job perfectly - no complaints. 
15541 4 I love these. I have ordered them twice. I especially like the size as so many of the cloths are tiny. 
15542 4 Housing looks great compared to the original clear housing. I have a all black motorcycle helmet so this was really needed. 
15543 4 Easy to operate. Getting good quality video. Very pleased. 
15544 4 Works fine. In order to prevent &#34;memory error&#34;, format it as FAT 32 and make the SD card as Primary Disk. 32 GB SD memory works fine on this. 
15545 4 This is my fourth Breakthough Photography Filter. You won t beat the Quality for Twice the Price. 
15546 4 Fast shipping and correct product! 
15547 3 Great buy 
15548 4 the kit seems to be what i ordered and i have clean lens now 
15549 4 Very sturdy, quick and easy set up 
15550 4 I got a lot of electronic devises in this bag for my trip. The bag is made of very nice material and looks nice. 
15551 4 What s not to love. This lens is aweswome 
15552 2 I guess this product is ok. It barely holds my I phone 6 without it popping off. 
15553 4 Have had no issues. Looks exactly as pictured.Pictures are the quality you would expect from a polaroid. 
15554 4 Just what I wanted... :) 
15555 0 Um… I never bought this… Yet it showed up in my Review your purchases … Mystery! Nothing charged in my name or on my account. I m sure it s a quality product, though! :D 
15556 4 Excellent product! Just what I needed for my lenses for an overseas trip. Fast delivery (sooner than promised!) and great price. Definitely highly recommend. 
15557 4 Works as described. I use it for cleaning my computer screen. 
15558 4 Used for snorkeling with the Go Pro and worked like a charm 
15559 4 Great product. Very clean and professional packaging. I used 3rd party software to configure my monitor instead of the included one, but works amazing. Would recommend to others. 
15560 0 This is a total scam!!! The adapter wasn t working at all!!! No specified 8V 3A output! It is a cheap crappy product, don t buy it! 
15561 4 Nice 
15562 4 Great security system, easy to install and pics on camera of surveillance is amazingly clear! I m impressed! 
15563 4 A little thin but over all its perfect for what I am looking for. 
15564 4 great 
15565 4 This kit works very well with my Coolpix camera. It has all you need. 
15566 4 So far so good. No issues in water. Product seems very rugged. Battery life is iffy. Buy some extras and keep them on hand. 
15567 4 Works great and comes with a ton of mounting options 
15568 2 Not bad for the price. NOT DGI. Product says DJI Phantom Prop Guards. DJI Is oddly similar to DGI. Coincidence? Product was OK. Fits Phantom 2 fine. Seems sturdy enough. Fulfilled by Amazon so no waiting for them to come from China. Not bad for $7.50 including shipping. 
15569 4 Great for carrying filters and it also carries my wireless remote for the camera. A lot easier that using the camera bag. Everything is right there when I need it. 
15570 3 The kit es very good, the antenna need s upgrade beacouse the range is poor. 
15571 4 great lens 
15572 4 Great Product 
15573 3 Ok. Its a bit complicated to use 
15574 3 Excellent for use with Lazes Levels.Very light weight. 
15575 4 These shorts are so comfortable, I don t want to take them off lol. Perfect size, not too big/not too small! Will definitely be ordering from here again! 
15576 0 Did not work when it arrived. Junk. 
15577 4 Great build quality of this charger. It fully charges my gopro in about an hour. 
15578 4 Awesome ....you can never go wrong with GoPro.... 
15579 4 works great, even in low light 
15580 4 An excellent pair of binoculars well suited for all outdoor activities. 
15581 3 Good high quality case. Very compact if that is your main focus it s the right case for you. If you want storage for more accessories you ll want something larger. Very pleased! 
15582 2 it s hard to get the top mount level/flat to take pics. it s very light which is good for transport, but kind of cheap feeling 
15583 0 DO NOT BUY!!! Charge lasts for 2 minutes.. waste of money. 
15584 3 I finally got to open this package.I love it. It was fun to put together. However my package was missing the equipment tray. A bit disappointing. Now i have to call them and go through the process. who has the time for that 
15585 2 ok 
15586 2 its ok for beginners 
15587 3 I actually use this for Nintendo 2DS! Works great. 
15588 4 This product is so much better than previous frames we have tried. Delighted with it! 
15589 4 Huge backdrop! Easy to use. Has a rod pocket for easy and fast installation. Machine wash & dry. 
15590 4 nice packaging and product 
15591 0 Small tight fit 
15592 4 Cute and works as described. 
15593 4 It is great! My daughter uses it for her photo shoots, and loves it! 
15594 4 These lights are wonderful for my youtube videos!! And the price I paid was even better. 
15595 4 Very nice. Compact. 
15596 3 Contrast leaves a little to be desired during use in full sun light but otherwise a very nice product. 
15597 3 Bien 
15598 4 Really like it and works well 
15599 4 this camera was for my daughter who is doing a lot of photography. .She is really satisfied with the quality. 
15600 4 It s small printer which is great to print small photos. It s great product Love it. 
15601 0 Didn t work for very long. Worked exactly 2 months....now they won t take it back...very disappointed. Would not buy this product again. 
15602 2 It s ok. 
15603 4 It is excellent, is beatiful camera. 
15604 4 works like a charm!! 
15605 4 Two batteries, and a charger with car and European adapters, what s not to like? 
15606 4 Beautiful camera in appearance and function. Bought this as a gift for my wife to use for her other hobby of oil painting. She loves it, I m a hero and she uses it every day. Everything a person needs comes in the package. 
15607 3 I like this lens, I just wish that it would come with an adapter. Instead of having to purchase one separately 
15608 3 I like it very much. The only problem I have is that the monipod unwise very easy and it starts lowering. They need to put instructions with it. It took me a while to figure how to make the monitor the correct height. 
15609 4 AMazing, Bright WHITE, theres no hint of yellow at all in this bulb. Worth the upgrade in bulbs :D 
15610 4 Great deal. quite bright and easy to use. Not yet on a shooting with it. Is quite light, still feels sturdy, barn doors sturdy as well, The light stand attachment is plastic as well, but feels strong with a large knob. All in all, I m happy with it. 
15611 2 Pictures were average 
15612 3 Great protection, cleverly designed 
15613 3 Great product and the fact that you can change the settings via the remote is absolutely essential. Only complaint is the battery doesnt last that long when using extensively. 
15614 4 Excellent 
15615 4 Great Camera! Everything was included as described. Order came on time 
15616 4 Works fine 
15617 4 prompt delivery, a very good value 
15618 3 It s been working for a long while now but is still a bit confusing when you want to upload pictures to it. 
15619 4 This is definitely my new favorite lens (I have a Canon 50mm 1.4 and a Canon 85mm 1.8) Here are some of the pictures I took with it in my last trip (with a 6D) https://www.facebook.com/sebas.cantillo/media_set?set=a.10152917884986568.1073741912.561506567&type=3&pnref=story 
15620 1 Too hard to get batteries back out had to use pliers 
15621 2 The strap inside doesn t actually fit the camera. 
15622 4 So many pieces...the camera is super. Haven t tried the wifi connections yet. But the camera is wonderful. Checked out prices, wouldn t of gotten such a good deal anywhere else. Glad I purchased it. 
15623 4 Everything arrived as promised. The attachment line works well to keep me from losing the lens cover. 
15624 4 A great camera. Very pleased with all features and the sharp resolutions of the pictures. 
15625 4 Great Fit, just what I needed! 
15626 4 Great 
15627 4 Factory parts, same as the one that came in the Phantom 2 V. box 
15628 4 I am just an amateur but it works great for my purposes. 
15629 4 I was afraid it would not fit well and may leak. This thing is awesome cant wait to go snorkeling. Mask is very soft and comfortable gopro fits on it like a charm. 
15630 2 Actually, it s a nice set but I can t compare to anything...still haven t used them. 
15631 4 I liked the product, and had no trouble with the purchase. thank YoU! 
15632 3 Too big for left side mount. Only fits right side. I decided to purchased Morros brand fits and both left and right. 
15633 4 excellent product. 
15634 4 Loved this! Took it to Cancun for all my activities and went to the highest pyramid of Cancun to some of the deepest sinkholes! Through saltwater and all. Definitely recommend it. Although it did break on a skateboarding accident I would buy again and recommend to anyone! 
15635 4 Good 
15636 4 very good 
15637 4 great little camera. 
15638 0 I only bought it because of the length. It s the only good thing. No TTL no matter what I do. I have another shorter TTL cable that works like a charm, so I know it s not my speedlights. Don t waste your money. 
15639 4 This charger worked perfectly as it charged up the new battery we ordered. I am very pleased with the performance with this charger. 
15640 4 Worked as expected. 
15641 0 Full charged batteries, put them in my GoPro, immediately after my GoPro showed 1/4 battery life. I returned and purchase the GoPro official battery charger and battery. 
15642 4 Great back with just the right amount of compartments for my gear. 
15643 3 Point and shoot 
15644 4 This is great so far. It s sturdy gets to a very good height. 
15645 3 Fabulous for the money! Secure, easy to adjust with very nice strong replacement hardware for the gopro. 
15646 2 Never have been able to get it to work. What s the secret? 
15647 4 I love my go pro, well made, durable. i use it all the time car,walk,bike, any where any time. if you are really active this is the camera for you 
15648 0 Not worth buying didn t do the job 
15649 3 Really helped us monitor our front door and our dog. Really came in handy when we got our puppy, saved a lot of anxiety. Still was pretty expensive for what it is, wifi drops often, and you need to buy the service really. 
15650 4 Solid. Has been reliable for a number of shoots. I would buy this again 
15651 3 Standard camera L-bracket works well 
15652 4 This is perfect if you are a blogger. It works perfect for food blogging and product reviews. I wished I had bought this sooner. The price is amazing, and it does so much for better lighting. 
15653 0 Not worth the money. Very flimsy and bends easily. 
15654 4 High quality extension poll. Haven t used it yet, but it looks to be very sturdy. Pole extends very smoothly! 
15655 4 Item came quickly. It works very well. It is easier to travel with since one does not need a cord with it. 
15656 4 Great deal! Just make sure that you hold the top of your camera when taking off the lens because some people have ripped peaces of the camera off! 
15657 4 Perfect item to add to your kit bag. I will use for wild life shots primarily and selfie family photos as well. 
15658 4 Good stuff 
15659 4 nice 
15660 4 Nice to have protection from dirt & dust. I lost original shortly after getting the camera. Will try to be more careful with this one. 
15661 4 This thing never dies. I never had to replace anything. 
15662 4 worked great 
15663 4 Very easy to put together due to the clear cut instructions on the enclosed video. This is not a flimsy product, it is well made. Will be using the MyStudio MS20 for my photography needs! 
15664 4 I always need extra batteries for weddings and this was a great price for a back up battery. It also lasts a long time! 
15665 2 Doesn t fit around the display very well. Especially by the flash button. 
15666 4 A must have for new flyers. Will save you from a crash. 
15667 3 Great product. Very good quality. I only wished it come with a rope or some kind of handle to easily carry it. For the rest, it has enough space and certainly will keep the GoPro save. 
15668 4 Great for party favors. Kids loved them! 
15669 3 yes I feel this is a excellent / for the money is great and I love it and I would recommend it to other people 
15670 1 Beware--These are not &#34;Sony Cyber-shot Digital Camera&#34; batteries! These are AA batteries and will work, but are not as advertised. Look closely and you will see they are made by &#34;Synergy&#34; in China! Misleading description and nothing special about them! 
15671 4 Fits perfectly using the 39mm filter threads on the lens, or on a threaded filter. Color matches very well to the standard Lecia lenses. A good deal, and MUCH less expensive than the lens maker brands. 
15672 0 instructions say frame the pic but there isnt even an opening (view finder) to see where it s aiming. further, the battery lasts not even a week. not holds a charge for a week, fails within a week. 
15673 4 Perfect for CANON EOS M3 
15674 4 The picture quality is very good both on the computer and the mobile app. night vision is also ok, this camera wont disappoint any budding geek like myself 
15675 4 I bought this pack with low expectation. I just want to try out ND filters. I m sure if I like them and start using them a lot I will upgrade to a set of nice quality, glass ones. But these are perfect to learn on for now. 
15676 4 very good I love it. 
15677 4 A must for serious lighting in the field for control and creativity. 
15678 0 I got it and charged it over night then it only worked for an hour then stop charging 
15679 4 Great tripod. works just at good as my $400 tripod. Wish I bought this first. 
15680 2 excellent item, solved my problem 
15681 4 nice 
15682 4 This battery performs as specified, and is good for 2000-plus photos with my Canon 70D. 
15683 4 easy setup to the wink system 
15684 4 The product was received as displayed and in a timely manner. 
15685 4 Compact yet roomy enough for all the essentials. We travel a lot and this is just what I was looking for to keep my gear safe yet easy to access. 
15686 3 It arrived a little later than expected. For the price it s definitely worth it although it falls off sometimes by itself. This is a great product although the original for my canon camera was much better 
15687 4 I love it! 
15688 3 Best cam in market for action sports, and it has so many accessories which make it the best! the only concern that it s so expensive I guess and you might need more than one GoPro to make a good videos.! 
15689 4 excellent 
15690 4 great seller - delivered as promised! 
15691 4 Perfect for a Canon digital & just what is needed. Nice case! 
15692 4 I would recommend any product made by this company. Their products are fantastic and the prices can t be beat. High quality merchandise and prompt service. When ever I want to purchase something for my Nikon I go to them first... 
15693 4 Excelent product 
15694 3 Good deal for the price ,will recommend it to anyone looking at buying a camera for a decent price. 
15695 4 The lens filter arrived in perfect condition. 
15696 4 Camera works real good, had a technical issue, but Walter worked it out fro me. 
15697 4 Works right out of the box when you add a photo source Looks great Nice Product with lots of extra features like music and video!! 
15698 4 Works as its description. Crystal clean video, fast setting, strong WiFi signal.! Great companion with Synology Surveillance Station! 
15699 4 This stand works fantastic on my desk. It does everything I hoped for at a great price. Easy to figure out without instructions. Very sturdy and light weight. Very versatile and allows you to more easily accommodate your creativity too. 
15700 1 Not very loud at all :( disappointing!!!! 
15701 4 Great product cleans glasses,computers,tv. I had a question and they answered in hours. Cloths are placed everywhere i need them. 
15702 4 Just one word........awesome! 
15703 2 wife bought this for me last xmas. works fine for it s purpose. had some problems with the &#34;water proof&#34; case. took it into the ocean and had some leaking. camera stopped working for about 24hrs. used camera with chest harness on a 5k fun run and worked within standards. 
15704 4 Good deal 
15705 3 cant go wrong for the price. 
15706 4 Love this Drone. Kind of wish I had paid a few more bucks and got the pro version, but this one still takes great video. I would suggest getting an extra battery though. 
15707 4 This is an update to my original review...Ritz did send the items that were missing (lens filters and another freebie instead of the remote). All replacements were Polarid brand. I was very satisfied. 
15708 4 Nice product and fast shipping 
15709 4 Recommended! 
15710 4 just what I was looking more. Exceeded my expectations. 
15711 4 Fast shipping, order 100% accurate, Thanks! 
15712 4 A great product. I bought it for a relative and he loved it. He uses it all the time and it still works great. You can see things clearly. 
15713 4 Great product to use with my GoPro. We needed something to use while on our ATVs. 
15714 4 Great bundle and great device. No issues at all. 
15715 3 The product was NINB but the buttons on the remote had scratches. Other than that everything works fine. 
15716 0 Broke/Fell apart within literally 30 seconds. The build quality was horrible. 
15717 4 Love this camera. It was recommended to me from a photographer friend as a good lower price range camera to start taking professional looking pictures with. It takes great sports shots and beautiful up close pics too. The bundle it came with had lots of great extra s too. 
15718 4 Light weight and durable! Works great with a GoPro! 
15719 4 ❤️ Them so cute 
15720 4 Outstanding battery and seller!!! 
15721 4 GOOD PRICE AND PRODUCT 
15722 3 Great price. 
15723 2 The battery seems to be working correctly. The battery casing was coming apart when we opened the package but I super glued it and it seems to be holding so far. 
15724 1 The ball joint swivel does not lock very well, and the legs don t bend out evenly, some legs bend more and cause it to be uneven. 
15725 4 C6721625 - AROO4273 - Thank you Henry for your help - very knowledgeable about the camera I purchased. 
15726 4 Just right! 
15727 4 not perfectly fit but does its job. 
15728 4 These lenses have allowed me to take great photos with minimal effort using a cell phone! Highly recommended. 
15729 3 Great bag for the video camera 
15730 4 very useful stick. great for GoPro and phone and camera. I ll bring it to europe with me 
15731 4 photos developed great, really nice product 
15732 3 good tool works for me 
15733 4 Batteries.stay charged battery charger is light weight and can fit in your pocket. If you need an extra or lost yours Great set for the price 
15734 0 Had a bad experience. I will stay with the 70-200 2.8 is VERSION 1 
15735 2 does not charge other gopro batteries. 
15736 4 Worked perfect with my Phantom 2. 
15737 4 very easy to install and it looks nice having a new eyecup on my Nikon D90. 
15738 3 looks good 
15739 4 This camera is great and reasonable price for many components and camera. Also, it is proper to beginners who don t have deep knowledge about camera. 
15740 4 Awesome camera for an awesome price!!! The quality is unbelievable! I love the fact that the cam has a speakerphone, so I can talk to my dog when I m not home. Super quick five minute set up, and you re ready to go. Awesome awesome awesome!!!! 
15741 4 Good product. Everything as promised. 
15742 4 Best speed lite I have ever had! Was very user friendly! 
15743 2 Okay 
15744 3 it works well 
15745 4 Works as needed for extra power at a reasonable cost. A good buy. 
15746 4 Surprisingly good quality for the price. 
15747 4 Love it it s isn t really big but it is great so you can have all your pics in one place 
15748 4 It was easy to figure out, Now I can enjoy video chatting with my mom much better that putting it on top of the computer. 
15749 4 No problems with product and/or delivery. Works with camera as described. 
15750 3 You get what you pay for, sure there s better selections. But this works for me during a dive or snorkeling. 
15751 1 ok, but very small. 
15752 3 Pretty good for the price. I usually take filters off when photographing but put them back on for protection. Polarizer is okay 
15753 4 This arm supports my 7&#34; ikan monitor very well. If your rig s rails are already crowded, you can detach the arm from rail support and connect to any 1/4&#34; thread. For me, I connect it straight to the BMPCC Smallrig cage and hang off to the side. 
15754 4 none 
15755 4 Great product for doing video recording. 
15756 4 Great item!!! Helped me during E3 2015 
15757 4 great size of case to fit into a backpack!!! 
15758 4 Fast shipment. Easy to install..... As advertised 
15759 4 Fast and perfect.. Thanks 
15760 4 Set up was so easy. The image quality is great. And the remote use via iPhone is very good. We re very happy with the Nest Cam. 
15761 4 THis has allowed us to scan in pictures that could have been lost forever from times of our childhood. 
15762 3 A little pricey, but works as designed. 
15763 4 Perfectly fits the DJI Phantom 3 PQ Drone. Its the safest way to transport our Drone. 
15764 4 Pouches are excellent. Just buy em, you won t be disappointed. 
15765 0 Does not work well at all. 
15766 4 Much more power than battery that came with camera. 
15767 0 I have an FD 50mm 1.4 lens whose aperature will not open all the way with this adapter. There is an adjustment on the lens that will allow me to fully open the lens manually but then the adapter won t fit. Frustrated... 
15768 4 Excelente 
15769 2 Great case,the postage was outrageous 
15770 4 Cool! 
15771 4 Cool 
15772 4 Small enough to keep in my truck, so I can use when I really need it. I filled mine with rice, and it provides a good, stable rest for my DSLR and telephoto. 
15773 3 Nikon lens have a good performance, i love take pictures to distance that allow show a close up with wide background scenery. the delivery was on the provided time 
15774 3 Stronger then most. Can hold larger cams. 
15775 4 A great camera! The accessories included are pretty cheap except for the digital cards, but I have no complaints. Thanks Amazon and The Imaging World. j 
15776 4 This camera is amazing, I made wonderful pics under water , I recommend for everyone, and enyoy you memories en your pics 
15777 2 Great quadcopter, I was practicing using it in my house, and it was very easy to control. Took it outside, you can t tell which way is forward when it s high up in the sky. It flew away, out of range and I never saw it again! 
15778 4 It rocks 
15779 1 The video quality is poor. It looks like I am looking at a Sonogram. I am opting to rent a video line from Home Depot 
15780 4 I like it 
15781 4 The battery works perfect. I didn t have any fitment issues like some of the reviews I ve read. Definitely recommend the product for the price 
15782 4 The shipping was fast and the dedication from Amcrest to provide help and satisfy your needs is extremely nice. As for the product itself, the camera quality is really good, the image is nice and clear. The installation and setting it up and getting everything functioning was also insanely easy. 
15783 4 Very nice camera. It works well for what I use it for, it does some nice close ups but you got to be patient and wait for it to focus to get great photos, glad I bought it. 
15784 4 This is a great little quad. It s easy to set up and fly. For a beginner, I would recommend buying a crash set, with the prop guards, to go with the quad. 
15785 3 This is a good replacement part, not quite as solid as the Nikon hood but it does the job. 
15786 4 Excellent. 
15787 4 This is the perfect little light for the job. I needed some indoor pictures of a two-week-old baby. It is just the right light for the job. 
15788 3 Awesome little compact for my Camera. I didn t really use the solution or tri pod though at all needed the charger and spare battery which work great. 
15789 3 they work 
15790 4 Great and affordable bundle for the GoPro! Completely worth the money. However, it didn t come with instructions but if you just check out the GoPro website it is easy to figure out how to assemble everything. 
15791 4 I haven`t yet tried the audio, so...nothing to say there,others all ok 
15792 4 This little beauty adds more ways to enjoy my Go Pro camera. I clip it onto my backpack strap and I can instantly record anything I want. It s also very inexpensive and easy to use. 
15793 4 great 
15794 4 Not exactly what I was looking for but works well 
15795 3 Can be a little finicky and takes a long time to boot up, also does not find my wifi internet source on first try, but once it is up an going... This thing is a real gem. Better than any other streaming device I have used. 
15796 4 very good 
15797 1 If I was home I could connect but not 10 miles away sorry I had to return product. 
15798 4 On time, very good 
15799 4 Great deal! 
15800 3 I like the look of film 
15801 4 Good selection of mounts at a great price. 
15802 4 Great piece of hardware especially for the price. Using two of these to support an SB900 and a SB700 
15803 4 Still the best of the best 
15804 4 great camera 
15805 4 If you have a nex-5 you need this view finder. It takes your camera and your pictures to a whole new level 
15806 3 Works great, just what I needed for my camera. The batteries stay charged for a long while and I take my camera on the road so it s very important. 
15807 4 Amazing, just love it 
15808 4 Works as advertised. 
15809 4 Give it to my grandparents, they like it. 
15810 4 Works great looks great 
15811 4 good 
15812 3 ok 
15813 4 Great 
15814 2 it s ok 
15815 4 It s what I expected. 
15816 4 Amazing Lamp & Price! Light is bright and is a great investment for my job! Lighting is important for my studio and this just did the trick! 
15817 4 GOOD. 
15818 4 My students are really interested in the solar system and in reviews, this product, albeit a tad expensive, looked the best. We were not disappointed! Large, easy to assemble, looks amazing. 
15819 0 Had it for less than a month and already the wifi won t work and the car won t charge (the light doesn t turn on when charger is connected). I need to check if there is a warranty on this thing. 
15820 4 exactly what i was looking for. Helps organize everything and more. GoPro Hero 3 black edition. 
15821 4 Great fit! 
15822 3 Good protection and lightweight. The cover doesn t come with hardware to connect to strap when removed so you either have to hold it or place it down while taking pictures. There is a material loop which I was able to connect to strap with a binder ring. 
15823 4 I Love this little camera. It meets or exceeds all expectations 
15824 4 Got this for my gopro hero 4 and it works perfect. Awesome little case and we ll built and great quality 
15825 4 Great product from a great seller 
15826 4 just what my camera needed,, 
15827 4 Light works great. Came with easy to read instructions. Took a couple tries to get it to work, but once I got it. it was easy. 
15828 4 A great lense!! I have only used it a couple of times but definitely one lense I will take with me everywhere! 
15829 4 Awesome case. Highly recommended!!! 
15830 4 works perfectly 
15831 4 Great glass for the money. Can t beat Vortex for quality versus price point. 
15832 4 This is a great little camera! I like going to the Pacific Northwest rainforests so it is nice to have this along and not need to work about it getting wet. Takes awesome pictures too. 
15833 0 This is the worst product I ever bought Colors are not coming out after cleanning them twice it starts printing and after half a page it goes back to give horrible results 
15834 4 I purchased this as a gift to my husband for his birthday. He loves the camera. It also has a great video function, and records nice, clear videos. I would buy this product again for myself. 
15835 1 It s ok at best 
15836 4 Works great. 
15837 3 Good product. 
15838 4 Super fast delivery, product is awesome and works great. 
15839 4 Easy to install. Works as promised. 
15840 4 Awesome ! 
15841 4 Can t wait to get mine. The reviews sound great. Best part, I was concerned of it fitting my Sony A100, as it is not listed. But, one review was of the A100. It s on my wish list, can t wait. 
15842 3 Smooth transaction. Fast shipping. A+++. Thanks you!!! 
15843 4 Fit perfectly, are easy to use, great price, and there are three of them! Can t beat that! 
15844 3 Worked as advertised. 
15845 1 Battery runs down too quickly. Does not record very much 
15846 3 worked great right out of the box 
15847 4 exactly match my tripod, official product! 
15848 4 We really love the images this camera records. Works perfectly now that it is setup. We mounted in the kids room and the image quality is fantastic during daytime or night time. It is nice to be able to control it remotely. Now we can get images anywhere we go. 
15849 4 Super handy 
15850 4 This is just the cord that I needed. My original is packed away in a POD and I wasn t able to charge my camera. Am now back in business. Thanks for the prompt service and perfect product. 
15851 4 Very pleased with quality and ease of use 
15852 3 Good! 
15853 4 I ve only been using it for a couple weeks, but it seems to work as advertised. Very happy at this point. I like the feature where it will recorder over the oldest videos if the disc is full. 
15854 4 Love this battery! They will run a lot longer than the OEM batteries which is important when you re right in the middle of taking pictures. 
15855 2 Just eh......I don t like how the plastic insert that holds the camera stuff keeps coming out. It is just over priced. The top section won t stay closed. I mean it works......but I wish I got something else. 
15856 0 It has a very bad resolution and it is very difficult to add or delete pictures. It is definitely not worth the money 
15857 2 I m reasonably happy with these batteries. I knew they would not match the OEM battery in usage time. 
15858 0 Returned after I got it. The picture quality was bad. 
15859 4 I have used these a few times. Like them a lot. Great for getting close up pictures without having to buy macro lens. 
15860 4 I m a professional videographer who routinely gets through an entire day of shooting on just one charge with this battery. I keep the OEM battery in reserve. 
15861 2 Have only used in the pool but works well. Wish the lanyard had its own mount hole but not a deal breaker. A low cost insurance policy when filming in and around water. 
15862 4 Great product. Use it for cleaning eyeglasses. They are larger than typical cloth used for glasses which makes it easier to use. 
15863 4 perfect! 
15864 3 Great Product 
15865 4 Works great 
15866 4 Great camera and the pictures come out awesome. 
15867 3 easy to fly,but battery does not last 5 min 
15868 4 Fits tight and keeps debris off the lens. It does not touch the lens surface when installed. I wish it had a lip so it would restrict how far it could be inserted. 
15869 4 Worked Great!!!! No fog like other cases. I went under about 13 feet without any problems. Clear pictures and all look amazing! Also, it float, so you can just put put the strap around your arm when swimming. 
15870 4 Excellent !! 
15871 4 Still learning how to use this. My brother loves his just like it. 
15872 4 Quick shipping, just as described. 
15873 3 Great lens. I use this lens for just about everything. The focus ring could be a little smoother as it tends to jump out sick when using the manual setting. Buy yourself a lens band, or a broccoli rubber band because it s weight causes constant lens extension... 
15874 4 VERY GOOD. 
15875 3 They made it right... a mishap corrected Thank you ! 
15876 3 Works really well...I just wish it came in better packaging so I could store it more easily. 
15877 4 fun and stylish 
15878 2 Makes noise while setting the focus, even in manual mode. Unfortunately, makes it impossible to record sound on the camera. 
15879 3 Internal charger in Kodak PlaySport bit the dust so found this as the replacement. Brought my PlaySport back to life in short order. 
15880 4 A fantastic flash at a fraction of the cost of the top brands. A solid buy for any photographer. 
15881 4 Awesome more fun than I deserve!! 
15882 4 perfect 
15883 4 Fits and works well. Panasonic should include this adapter as part of the camera rather than selling this as an accessory (since I believe that this was a faulty design at the beginning) 
15884 4 Can t beat the price 
15885 4 This bundle was actually cheaper than the just the price of the camera alone on another website; got a lot of extra stuff for a lower price. 
15886 4 Great 
15887 2 Finally got to try it, due to broken arm. Not what I expected. Don t know about t lens & was looking for more of a close up view. 
15888 3 great price/original nikon battery 
15889 2 not connected with wifi 
15890 4 I tried it with a37 and a65. Fits well, works fine, no problems, so far. Price was good, free shipment, and came fast. 
15891 0 This cord did not work and I was not able to return it 
15892 4 Good quality product. I recommend. 
15893 2 GPS is hard to use. Needs more match markings for barrel. 
15894 4 Ty 
15895 4 Love this! Seems to be very high quality, and for the price, it can t be beat compared to GoPro branded accessories! It has a VERY strong clamp, and the neck is very bendable. I m not sure why anyone would spend the extra money on GoPro brand stuff! 
15896 4 I am in love with this camera and my kid finds it very fun too. 
15897 3 Just fine 
15898 4 Works as advertized and certainly beats the high price of true Panasonic batteries. 
15899 4 purchased in 2010 for a Lumix and its a perfect fit and rigid 
15900 4 These provide good protection for the front lens element. I use Xume magnetic adapters, so I can have them on and off in less than a second. 
15901 4 Great cameras, work real good and clear. 
15902 4 Good case, protects your camera, and it looks chic and stylish 
15903 4 The best! 
15904 3 It s a great cam!! 
15905 3 So vintage and unique. The snaps on the back (the cover flap) come off too easily though. I am keeping it because it has such a warm caramel color to it! 
15906 4 Works as needed and is well made, what else is there to say? 
15907 4 Worked great in Romania! 
15908 3 best deal for the money 
15909 4 Very effective lens cleaning cloths. 6&#34;x7&#34; size is good and they are a good value as well. 
15910 4 Strong, solid, well made. I use them in my kit to hold my flashpoint streak lights, even at 90 degrees on a boom arm they are solid. 
15911 4 Good! 
15912 4 Good quality 
15913 3 This was a cheap replacement for an existing system. Q-See is fine for the home grade quality surveillance systems. Easy to set up and has a mobile app. Will work with most bnc cameras. 
15914 3 just received it ,but so for I like it 
15915 4 Absolutely outstanding. 
15916 4 This is a great product and works great with my GoPro, would definitely recommend this product and have had nothing, but a good experience when using it on my vacation. Seller was great and package arrived on time, as described. 
15917 4 Works like a charm 
15918 4 Great 
15919 4 Saved the day when the rain came!! Really easy to put on and coud keep taking pictures. Make sure you can the Pro version as it is the one with the velcro closure at the bottom. 
15920 4 great product for charging three GoPro batteries at one time. 
15921 4 Good product n easy to set up even if you are not an expert 
15922 4 Solid product. I was surprised at the size. This is a large case. I ll attach it to the outside of my camera bag. However it s designed to protect really expensive filters and protection matters. I have to get use to the size 
15923 4 Went windsurfing with it, and i didnt worry at all about my phone! It is an iphone 5c and I let it float with no problem. 
15924 4 Quite inexpensive and it delivers. I am surprised at how good the images are it produces. I would not hesitate to use if for professional applications. And the macro feature is very good too. I would recommend this lens to anyone. Russ 
15925 4 Great Tripod keeps my camera in place especially when I do portrait shots. Nice and lightweight easy to handle. 
15926 4 Henry at Foscam did an excellent job in assisting me with setting up my new cameras. He was very patient, methodical and explain what he was doing. I have had foscam cameras for 3 years now and have never had a problem with them. 
15927 4 Works great in camera, batteries charge up and camera works fine, again. 
15928 4 Received as described and promptly! Good quality and price. 
15929 2 It fits and all but it would be so much better if it was reversible for storage. 
15930 4 For the price you cant go wrong. This gives you the details you re looking for. 
15931 0 Yes it was used and had all the stuff, but it failed to operate. The code it was throwing was researchable on Google, but the fix listed didn t last. Sent it back for a refund. 
15932 4 No issues with the product or delivery 
15933 4 Perfect fit for my newest Canon Camera 
15934 3 Flys really good. Just wish it had more flight time 
15935 4 I m very pleased in how fast I received my order, I ordered the camera on Sunday and had it Tuesday morning, as we were leaving for vacation in Cancun and I wanted to use the camera under water. I ve played with the camera and so far so good. 
15936 4 Very good 
15937 4 Good quality camera for the price I wasn t expecting such a good picture I would buy again 
15938 4 Great bang for the buck. Works great. 
15939 4 Absolutely LOVE this thing. It s so cute and compact and easy to use. I ve already gone through most of the film I ve bought. I m going to use this for a guest book at my wedding, so people can include a picture in there &#34;words of advice&#34;. 
15940 4 So Far so good. Cloths are big, and I have enough for all my glasses and sunglasses to last for a couple of years! 
15941 4 Handy little wrist strap. I use it for my Canon G12. 
15942 3 So far it has worked well and the price was definitely a bonus for something of this quality. 
15943 4 Kind of big but its a great flash. I was very nervous to purchase, but glad I did. I use the front led light for nightlife photos. Helps a great deal! 
15944 4 The color,contrast and sharpness are great, I love how closeup it will focus. Feels solid, I have it attached to my OMD EM5 II - it seemed a little heavy and stressing my right-hand, so I purchased the optional grip and now it feels much better. 
15945 4 camera has great color and clarity 
15946 4 Works great, just the accessory needed 
15947 4 Works well for my small business. I even have one outside for back door security. 
15948 3 The result is awesome. Plain and simple. Is it crazy harsh light? Yes. It s continuous lighting so of course looking at the sun will result in some temporary blindness. Am I slightly exaggerating? Yes. See the picture :) 
15949 4 Love this frame, it is easy to use and easy to set up and has wonderful clarity. I wouldn t buy any other brand. 
15950 3 Love it! :) 
15951 0 More of a colorful child s toy than a useful instrument. NO focus after a literal few feet. They are ALL like this. WASTE NOT your monsy. Worthless as well in warm weather. 
15952 3 I have barely began to use the lens. So far excellent. 
15953 4 Item fits on my two lenses, works well. 
15954 4 just what I need fo macro photos 
15955 3 Smelly when I first got them, but I put them on my porch for a week or so and smell is gone. 
15956 4 Its fun, you get exactly what you expected, a different way to use your DSLR, also you get 3 macro, so you dont need to buy another product to play with. You also need to use it in lighten places, and on manual. Thats all you need to know. 
15957 0 Don t buy this. I am not able to close my screen completely after applying this. It s not fit for the d5300. Now this company wants me to explain the way I installed a screen guard. It s really pathetic. 
15958 0 This cage DOES NOT fit the a7rii. The battery door does not line up and the top dial is severely blocked. Good build quality however, just wish it fit like it claimed to. 
15959 4 Light work awesomely!! Have to take pics for my business website and boy do they light up!! Received them as expected, great packaging too! 
15960 3 Camera takes very nice pics. This is a very reasonable bundle. 
15961 3 great item,you can charge a battery. instead of using you camera. fast charging good battery too.great addition to your cam setup. 
15962 1 Honestly, spend the money and buy a quality UV filter. This one left my images all very fuzzy and streaky. I ended up taking it off my lens and the images were 10 times sharper. 
15963 0 did not come with a power supply. other customers said the same thing AFTER i purchased. o well. it is going back! 
15964 3 nice product 
15965 4 was exactly what I wanted. Worked perfectly on the device 
15966 4 Fast shipping great value everything you need to get started 
15967 4 Awesome camera works perfect and its easy to use 
15968 3 Great for viewing sun spots. Was hoping to see more than just sun spots, but maybe I m not using it correctly. Not sure if it s possible to see sun flares or other exciting events. 
15969 4 Bought the rotary slide tray,as I had a Sawyer slide projector given to me,but had no slide trays. The slide tray was given,along with the projector,to my relatives. And yes the slide tray was in perfect condition. 
15970 0 Basically no useable directions, and not user friendly at all. I can t even tell if this thing is broken or if I m not using it right. Definitely don t waste your money. 
15971 3 Battery works fine. Doesn t seem to last as long as stock battery. Still a good a cheap alternative. 
15972 2 NEED TO SEND BACK A $200 BATTERY THAT DOESNT WORK 64 GB MEMORY CARD DOESNT WORK EVERY THING ELSE WORKS 
15973 3 Clearer at night than day. Night vision is outstanding. Camera is bigfer that what was expected but very happy with it. 
15974 4 Gift for my mom and it works great. 
15975 0 poor quality. top button doesn t go all the way in. hinge is very poor quality. comes off so easy. 
15976 0 never worked. in trash it goes 
15977 4 best value I have been able to find. 
15978 1 It s an attractive bag but it s not constructed as well as I had anticipated. 
15979 4 incredible offer! 
15980 4 I was very happy with my purchase. Had a trip coming up when I ordered it, and I came in very handy, having extra charger and batteries. 
15981 4 Really Good !!!! 
15982 4 the best deal in cameras ever ! i own two and want more. 
15983 4 easy to hook up well made 
15984 4 These rear lens caps fit the lenses snugly and are the same quality as the Sony covers received with other lenses. I m purchased these go to on the Sony 28mm f2 lens which did not come with a cap. 
15985 4 Like it a lot, but wish I had spent the additional $$$ to get the 55-300mm instead. Probably would have been worth the money in the long run. 
15986 4 I believe in good metal screw-in lens caps. They stay on and are more difficult to lose. I ve used these since the late 1960s. 
15987 3 does what I wanted 
15988 4 Extremely pleased with the product. Arrived just in time for my trip to Southern California where there is just too much light. The filter did an amazing job in places like Palm Springs, Joshua Tree National Park and the Salton Sea. 
15989 4 This id the perfect screen protector for the Nikon D5300. Buy iy and you will like the protection it gives the display. Good price also. 
15990 4 Thank you, splendid item! 
15991 4 Very Nice will enjoy 
15992 4 it is goood!! 
15993 3 Camera came highly rated and did not disappoint. The only drawback was no manual but I knew that beforehand 
15994 4 Super sharp, not too heavy. Only thing missing is IS and anyone who buys this goes in with eyes open, so there s really not much to complain about. 
15995 4 I purchased the 2.5 amp version at the same time I purchased my 8&#34; Schmidt-Cassegrain and realized that the power was not sufficient. I purchased this supply subsequently. I like the addition of the screw connector on this model. 
15996 3 Canera excellent some of the accessories are of questionable quality but time will tell. 
15997 3 Pretty neat device with remote controlled pan and tilt. I used it while I was on vacation to look around the house and it worked pretty well in day and night. 
15998 1 I was unable to get the motion detection to work properly, despite moving the cameras to many different locations, and trying front-on and sideways motions in front of it. I returned the package to Amazon. 
15999 3 Does a good job of keeping on my shoulder. Not sure if much more comfortable than the wide canvas strap bag already has, though. 
16000 4 Love the boarders... 
16001 4 LUUUUUUUUVED IT!!!!!!! 
16002 4 Very well made product. Good value. 
16003 3 Great deal! 
16004 4 No problem at all. Meets all expectations. 
16005 4 Very Good Product 
16006 4 Met my expectation.and it s works good on my camera. Described as I received the right product. 
16007 1 Got camera without Instruction Manual in English. Please send me an Manual in English language. Regards, B. Jezdic 
16008 4 I was tired of the pantry light with a pull chain and this wireless wall switch was the perfect solution. It was easy to install and works perfectly. I love it and would definitely recommend this item to anyone with a need for it. 
16009 3 Nice camera and very easy set up. Works as well as expected. I will purchase more of these. 
16010 2 does not tighten properly. falls off camera every now and then. one shoe that does not have a stop fitted,has a tendency to have the product mounted to it,come off. 
16011 2 Thicker than your average Compact flash beware if your device has strict dimensions as mine did. 
16012 3 took a moment to understand the new lens attaches directly to the old lens not directly to the camera. Works well and does improve the zoom. 
16013 4 Great binoculars. This is the second pair I ordered. Very easy to adjust and the magnificatiuon is great. 
16014 4 Best Camera I have EVER had! Superb. Small, fit in small crossbody purse I had at Disney...and the photos are great. Easy to use and better Zoom than my previous &#34;Big&#34; camera. Will never buy anything but Samsung again! 
16015 4 Excellente item, excellent quality! 
16016 4 Excellent. No trouble staying on my D750 like the original failed to do, and seemingly the same style and material. 
16017 4 Works perfectly 
16018 3 pics arnt Fantastic, but there good 
16019 4 Love it! Great lens 
16020 4 Works well 
16021 4 Very good filter. 
16022 4 Does the job, love that camera! 
16023 3 Thanks 
16024 4 It works perfect. 
16025 4 A low cost alternative to Zacuto products, for certain things. 
16026 4 I bought this as a gift for my fianc&eacute;. Last summer I purchased the mini neo instax camera for his birthdays. I thought this would be a nice accompaniment. He absolutely loves it, and it works remarkably well. 
16027 4 Hard to find item. Glad to get it at a good price! 
16028 4 it s like a camera pillow for your eye hole. 
16029 3 Fit well on my gopro hero 4 silver. Everything I expected and will try them diving soon. 
16030 3 rec d as promised and as advertised 
16031 0 It is hard to rate this item since the battery that came with the camera was defective ( would not hold a charge ) and I could not replace the camera. 
16032 4 LENS produces excellent IQ. Priced very reasonable. Iwould buy it again. 
16033 4 awesome you just have to be gentle with it or it will possibly break 
16034 4 Great product! Gave as a gift , used onstantly! 
16035 4 Just what was needed for trips. 
16036 2 This item works fine as a screw-in lens hood, except that it only adds about 7/8&#34; out from the threads, not really much shading. Mine actually looks skinny relative to the one pictured. 
16037 4 Very nice camera. I really love it. Now if I can learn to use it a little better. 
16038 4 Worked very well! 
16039 2 Ok, fits well, looks nice. The unit I got had a mark down the middle. Looked like it had been scored by a box or box cutter when shipped. Arrived in time for our trip and looked good while protecting the camera. 
16040 1 The umbrellas that come with this are decent but the rest of the kit just screamed super cheap. 
16041 4 Quick response and a gfood product.Favorably priced. 
16042 0 Very Cheap And Defective. 
16043 1 too small for my canon 100-400 lens and camera shame, it was nicely made 
16044 4 Very good quality and versatile. 
16045 4 Great accessory especially for longer shoots. Slight learning curve but worth it! Keeps weight balanced and distributed to both arms! Definitely helps with arm fatigue!!! Been using it with my canon 6d. Its Small, lightweight and well constructed! 
16046 4 Awesome pair of binoculars for the price. Super clear, easy to hold and focus. Great buy. 
16047 3 Very satisfied with results of this product as of today. Received an excellent support from vendor with a couple of issues with installation. I would buy it again. 
16048 4 The battery charger arrived in no time at all! It works great and better than the original charger. Just in time for my vacation pictures. Thanks so much for the timely delivery! 
16049 4 good quality, exactly what i expected 
16050 3 This case carries all of my GoPro equipment. I love the color and material. Very handy when going on trips. 
16051 4 great camera and easy purchase 
16052 4 It is working like a charm on slides from the 60 s & 70 s! 
16053 4 I love this, it has everything I need until I can find the bag with all my accessories. 
16054 4 love this camera 
16055 0 Different from what is described and from the product pictures; mind did not have the white rubber grip stripes. Judging by other reviews, its seems that there are many version of this product. 
16056 4 Works great! 
16057 4 Very nice camera, all I wanted and more. 
16058 4 This thing is AWESOME! 
16059 4 good product for my go pro a real must at times. Thanks!! 
16060 0 Total JUNK!! Do Not Buy!! It would not connect to wireless router plus when you finally have the camera hooked up through wire but then screen shows up black no pictures!! 
16061 4 good 
16062 2 nice toy, impractical. Better get rx100 and connect it to phone 
16063 4 Love this little set up, I ve had it since 2011, I use it often and take it out on location too! 
16064 4 Fits my neewer vk750ii speedlight, a little loose but it will work. 
16065 4 Everything it said, everything works great 
16066 4 I bought this camera to peek in on my cats when away. It worked just fine. I didn t get the model that zoomed but if I were to purchase another I would get that feature. Good picture, easy to install and view. 
16067 0 This doesn t fit the Neewer flash at all. It s too small. The description says it will, but it s too small, even after trying to bend/shape it a bit 
16068 0 Poor quality and did not work effectively. 
16069 1 love it perfect 
16070 4 Perfect 
16071 4 Worked like a charm 
16072 4 I use these cloths to clean all types of things-cell phone screen, computer screen, eyeglasses, etc. A rainbow of colors and handy to have all over the house. This is a great value. 
16073 4 Great backpack! flew with it as a carry on no problem light and nice 
16074 4 I m enjoying this as a reliable camera with auto settings -- good pictures and easy to use. 
16075 4 Works great on Nikon DX AF-S Nikkor 18-55mm 1:3.5-5.6G ED. Took about 30 minutes to remove the old part and install the new one. 
16076 0 I bought this battery for my Nikon D3300, It did not work with my camera. Its not made for working in a Nikon camera. 
16077 3 Good sized bag. Fits camera body and two small lenses. Great for using when I m out on my bike. 
16078 4 Fast delivery. High quality. A lot of fun. Just buy and enjoy. 
16079 3 Great Kit for reverse lens macros! 
16080 4 perfect! 
16081 4 Perfect!!! 
16082 4 Thank you for the replacement of the remote control it work on my Canon 70 D thank you very much I appreciate for your kindness 
16083 3 great bag just wish it was a tad bigger 
16084 4 Vincent was very patient and helped solve my problem. Thank you 
16085 3 Very nice camera for non-professional! Easy to use and good results. 
16086 4 Love the camera! The quality is really nice, me and my bestfriend do vlogs and its the perfect mini dslr! Great buy! 
16087 4 Cowboy Studio does it once again. This backdrop is perfect for on-white photos. One side is almost luster, while the other is glossy. Its easily cleanable and stores nicely. 
16088 4 Works great! Just what I needed for my canon rebel camera. 
16089 3 good fit 
16090 4 Clear picture quality for price. Highly recommended. 
16091 3 Happy with it simple installation good picture quality i could see my house from anywhere anytime 
16092 4 A great addition to my collection. I highly recommend it. 
16093 4 Great, works fine. 
16094 4 Amazing quality for the price :) I was pleasantly surprised and WOW the shipping was lightening fast! 
16095 4 ok 
16096 4 I have one and need a second one, so I purchased again. Works well with the batteries for my Canon EOS M. 
16097 4 it brings life to my flash light!! love it! a must-have. 
16098 3 I got this for my camera so that I could use for my phone. It does fine!! 
16099 0 I ve had this for less than a month and it has already broken. What a waste. 
16100 4 great belt 
16101 4 quality product 
16102 4 I am just getting back into photography and love these little helpers. As I get better I will put them inside my camera bag but for right now I keep them very close at hand 
16103 4 great product 
16104 4 Very good remote control. Works well with my Canon camera. 
16105 4 Flawless. 
16106 4 Works well. 
16107 4 absolutely love it!! so nice to have two batteries charged at once and the graphics to let you know status. 
16108 1 For fun is ok but You ll get what you pay. Can t compare to GoPro lol 
16109 1 I bought this tripod to support my iPad. The mount I bought attached no problem but this tripod is not strong enough to support the weight of the iPad. Even when it s all tightened it droops down. Very disappointed! 
16110 3 Nice case. My Pentax K-30 fits pretty well, even with my longer zooms. It could be a bit too small for an SLR with very long lenses. 
16111 4 Great little tripod 
16112 4 I absolutely love this film and the price is unbeatable compared to others. 
16113 2 I am huge guy but still stripe is too large. I have it tide up to max but there is still a lot of space and possibility to slip from my wrist. 
16114 4 This is a great lighting kit. So easy to use.Well made. 
16115 4 Exactly what I was looking for! I immediately discarded the clamp that seemed weak compared to GoPro s version. I attached it directly to my kayak and now I get some great shots. Affordable too. 
16116 4 The quality of the monitor is good; it does come with a F970 battery plate and works perfectly; the overall design is compact and nice, good workmanship. 
16117 3 I guess it s a great product, never really used it. 
16118 4 Great pad 
16119 4 I received my frame one week ago. It was very easy to load and has worked perfectly since turning it on. The picture quality is very good. I would definitely buy it again! 
16120 4 Works really well so far. Good features. 
16121 4 I absolutely love this lens! It s perfect for macro shots of flowers, portraits and it s even great as a medium range zoom lens! I d definitely recommend it! 
16122 3 Fits PVS-14. I understand the right thread is 30.25, but the 30 is loose and this is tight. I like this better. 
16123 4 Very nice, great lens! 
16124 4 Awesome camera and lens package. 
16125 2 Item is scratch on the screen it look heavy used (not used only twice) as advertise missing Lens cap, dusty in side the Len but it is functions, next time better buy new don t trust the advertise. 
16126 4 will order more when I need it 
16127 4 Great price for a really decent tripod. 
16128 4 The floats worked great. i checked them in my pool and they kept all my cameras from sinking. i liked the fact you could use the quick disconect to go from float to regular strap 
16129 3 A cheaper plastic not sure how it will work under pressure or in water 
16130 3 Didn t pay attention to the fact that the camera is rechargeable. I don t always have the power supply to power up again on the road. Otherwise, it is a small, functional, and easy to use camera. 
16131 4 As expected 
16132 1 I suppose 3.5 stars would have been more accurate. Only one of the batteries worked. The other we only found out was a dud until after the 3-day return period had ended. 
16133 2 Just as advertised. My only wish would be for it to be little beefier so that it can hold a reflector at any position set. 
16134 4 Very good package. I recommend. 
16135 0 It does NOT have night vision and it DOESNT connect to my iPhone waste of money and time 
16136 4 Got these for fathers day and really think they are a great pair of glasses. Very sharp images and easy to focus. 
16137 4 Works very well. 
16138 4 Why waste $ on Go Pro? 
16139 4 great buy, batts last long, lightweight and portable. 
16140 4 love using it have gotten great results 
16141 4 Love it 
16142 0 We wasted our money on this one. It did not work in our camera. The camera did not recognize it. 
16143 4 Takes a steady hand but with careful installation and clean area the shield works fantastic! Fits perfect and is invisible on the camera. 
16144 4 Great product, easy to use, super clear and simple to focus. Can t believe they are discontinuing this product 
16145 4 Perfect as usual. You can trust Tiffen and save money too. 
16146 2 The filter often come off when changing the hood. Should have bought more. Can see hood in some zoom in shots. 
16147 4 Easy to use! 
16148 3 So far so good, great storage for my Phantom 2. Fits snug in the bag with H3-3D Zenmuse attached, quality is decent. plenty of room for accessories like batteries and tools i need like small hex screw and phillip. 
16149 0 No it s not working I needed return it? 
16150 4 Super easy to install and my test shots show a nice improvement over direct flash without the shadows caused by bouncing it off the ceiling. Definitely a nice option to have in my arsenal. 
16151 4 I was a bit leery when I realized exactly how lightweight this tripod was, but was reassured once I tried it out. Admittedly, my photography is mostly indoors; I don t know if this thing could stand up in a stiff breeze, but for my purposes it s perfect. 
16152 4 Great design and easy to use 
16153 4 Superb...A plus 
16154 4 Henry at Foscam tech service helped me set up remote access to the camera and everything is working as expected. The quality and price are great and it serves my purposes very well. The tech support person was very knowledgeable and addressed all my questions. 
16155 4 Very happy. 
16156 4 I am still leaning to use these but I highly reccomend them 
16157 1 Big, bulky 
16158 4 good 
16159 4 Wow, I should have gone to 2 inch viewing long ago. 
16160 2 works well but if you have the extender arm unclamped a small pin can fall out and make it unusable. Just remeber to keep the clamp locked at all times 
16161 4 Super cute camera! Doesn t include any film though. 
16162 3 Great product! 
16163 4 fast shipping and the replacement was great 
16164 4 A good product. 
16165 4 The camera was more than I expected. Great buy for the price. Also, the support and service was way above expectations. I would highly recommend Digideals4less. 
16166 4 This tripod is better than expected! It is light weight, but very sturdy and easy to use. Great company to work with, great product and great price. Thank You!!! 
16167 4 so it s good I like it but it don t pause so use WINDOWS MOVIE MAKER to merge vids 
16168 4 Great camera works as expected. 
16169 4 Arrived when promised, charged it up, put into my camera and it worked superbly. Thank you STK. 
16170 0 Does not fit my battery. I have to &#34;tape&#34; it down just a certain way, in order for it to work. 
16171 3 Very Good 
16172 4 I can now recharge my battery (or spare battery) inside or in the car. Good set. 
16173 4 Great deal, works great. 
16174 3 This thing is awesome, very straight forward. A bright LED attached to a heatsink. The ONLY problem with it is that the fan is too loud for audio recording... but what I m doing is buying a good case fan ($15 max) online and swapping it for a quiet one. 
16175 4 Exactly what was needed. works perfectly 
16176 3 It s a good buy for the price ..only thing tripod is the cheap model 
16177 4 Outstanding image quality 
16178 1 Went dead before I could even use them. They need to be uses as soon as they arrive. 
16179 4 I love this lens. Such a great deal for the price and the images are so sharp. Produces a wonderful bokah! 
16180 4 They get the job done for fair price. 
16181 4 VERY CHARING AND PROMPT... 
16182 0 Poor quality - juddery. Nylon slider guides seem to have too much friction to be useful for video work. 
16183 4 Works fine 
16184 4 Great product. Easy to use and very efficient. 
16185 4 These things are worth their weight in gold! 
16186 4 AAA+++ 
16187 4 Excellent product. Works perfectly at a big discount on the Nikon product. 
16188 4 Cool bag! Lots of compliments. Outside is almost too nice to accidentally scuff. Inside is very firm foam. Zippers...holy cow. Weather resistant and you can feel it when you use the zippers. Very resistant when used. Inside of lid uses entire lid and zips closed to use full space! 
16189 4 This is a great camera for saving memories. I highly recommend it. 
16190 4 An excellent, easy to use and sturdy table-top tripod--- works well with the FugeTek selfie-stick I also purchased. 
16191 1 [[VIDEOID:76a1a54ded862b79ccdd6f8e1362a7c8]] The product arrived on time, but one of the bulb was damaged. Tried resolving with seller, but could not. 
16192 4 great for my strobes and speedlights for the price 
16193 2 Its a good starter telescope,it does not have an adjust handle and you can only look at the moon 
16194 4 Great extension for outdoors surveillance camera. 
16195 4 It was nice 
16196 3 Almost perfect. Needs a closure for the inside (battery) pocket. as is, the battery falls out when removing camera. I will need to sew-in a Velcro strip to secure it. 
16197 3 Great hidden camera. 
16198 4 I borrowed one before I bought this, I liked it and it works well for a cheaper option, I haven t noticed that double circle you get with some of the other cheap ones. Good for the money 
16199 4 A bit heavier than I had thought but not too bad. Easy to use and takes excellent pictures. I was looking for a lens for shooting wildlife without having to pay for a pro level lens and this one is perfect. I highly recommend it. 
16200 4 Nice package for a good price. Although not evident from the photo, the charger and batteries are produced by Vivitar, a name I have come to trust over the years. Seems fully compatible with the Olympus camera, charger, and battery. 
16201 2 Love this camera. Takes great photos with a faster shutter. With an add bonus of using AA batteries. 
16202 4 I m really excited to take up this new or almost new hobby to be more than a hobby I dont know. I might not be like a Grandma Moses but I think the enjoyment wiil out way any bad things that might happen I expect lot s of fun 
16203 4 A good looking case, just fits my Nikon 3200 with zoom lens, but it fits and it works. Well constructed. 
16204 4 I bought this ring to use my 58mm filters on my 52mm Canon 24mm pancake lens. It works exactly as described, and the quality is top notch. The included cloth is a nice touch as well. 
16205 4 excellent 
16206 4 This grip is a lifesaver. Makes holding the camera so much easier. 
16207 4 These are simply wonderful!! The feel of the microfiber is really great &amp; they work nicely on my items. These are so nice I used the first one and placed it back in the plastic holder it was in...I ve never done that before with any other cleaners. 
16208 4 After getting hosed by a hobby shop in Detroit, I did what I should have done in the first place. Fast shipping, exactly as described. Thanks guys! 
16209 2 Good except the portion that holds the camera is flimsy. I just use it for my iPhone and it can barely hold that. 
16210 4 Works great! 
16211 4 Used at my shop door I installed facing down and do far -great! 
16212 4 This has made a large difference in my ability to manually focus my camera. Well worth the extra cost. Only gripe is that is sticks out a little more, but in a short while, you wont notice. 
16213 4 keeps it dry... 
16214 4 Nice for the price. 
16215 4 This is awesome camera... 
16216 4 Excellent camera, the LCD screen makes it easy to use in situations where the camera isn t on a mount. 
16217 4 Wonderful product!! So easy to use! 
16218 4 quality product 
16219 4 I LOVE IT! 
16220 4 LOVE IT 
16221 4 Great little charger for home or auto. I have not charged the batteries, but look forward to taking this on our road tr vacation 
16222 4 Jonathan Reed from foscam tech support was very helpful in getting me connected remotely to the camera. 
16223 4 Just what I was looking for. Works as it should. 
16224 3 Does what you would expect, protects you lens 
16225 4 So handy and a better option (imo) than buying the instax camera. 
16226 4 Keeps the light out of the view screen, fit my D70s perfectly. 
16227 4 Excellent 
16228 4 Love this film! So stinkin cute and a really good deal! I use it with my Instax mini 8! 
16229 4 Great camera to keep an eye on things in your home when you travel! We bought it so that we could see our dog while we were gone! 
16230 4 That is a nikon lens. It should say it all. Perfect quality, Pictures come out perfect !!! Great lens for the price. 
16231 4 This product is handy, great purchase! 
16232 4 Does everything as advertised, an amazing machine. 
16233 4 Just as described, delivered quickly. 
16234 4 I ve not used any of them yet. Ordered them for a party. They are cute though. 
16235 4 Awesome lens love it on my camera 
16236 4 Henry fi9826p great help very good 
16237 4 Did not realize this shipped from china directly, so shipping took a little longer then expected. Overall a good product though 
16238 4 Great product so far 
16239 4 thank you 
16240 4 It s great having spare batteries for my camera! They work just as well as the original and the charger will charge the original battery. 
16241 3 I was very pleased with the camera and most of the equipment included in the package except the slave flash. The slave flash is extremely poor quality, the battery cover will not even come off so that i can try it out. 
16242 3 A bit expensive but ok 
16243 4 A very sharp lens. The camera is filled with features that move it past the usual point and shoot. 
16244 4 Very nice 
16245 4 Purchased this for my son for our Florida vacation! Was skeptical buying this unit. This little GeekPro is amazing. The quality of the video is awesome. It is worth every penny. Great product! Highly recommend! 
16246 4 Its a spare battery. Seems to do the job 
16247 4 Does the job, and the package came with a cute pink stylus and something else I m not exactly sure what it is. I think it s some kind of mini stand for a phone? 
16248 3 Great buy, especially for those that need the power. Pack has been going strong since purchased in 2007. I would highly recommend. 
16249 4 Awesome product 
16250 0 It doesn t work. 
16251 0 worthless. cameras stop working on first day. no warenty. 
16252 3 Excellent product 
16253 4 Great product. 
16254 0 Not good, cheap quality, come without instructions in an envelope. 
16255 4 Works fine! 
16256 3 Better than I thought 
16257 3 It s what I expected 
16258 3 Works extremely well and a great alternative to OEM batteries 
16259 4 Came on time. Works perfectly. No problems at all. 
16260 4 Exactly what we hoped it would be. Large viewing screen and clear picture. Love it. 
16261 1 This lens took ok pictures, but the build quality left me wanting more. The body was loose and rattled and the aperture ring did not adjust consistently. Because of this I returned the lens and will be buying a rokinon. Hopefully the quality is better. 
16262 4 Love it! 
16263 3 It s an OK bag. It s really nicely built, but it s not as big as I expected. I was looking for a larger bag than what my Canon EOS 7D came with. I will use it in place of the Canon bag. 
16264 4 Excellent pictures. Easy setup. 
16265 4 Cheap and works as it should! 
16266 4 Very good case, perfect for my camera. 
16267 4 These batteries work perfectly I my D3200, and the charges last a bit longer than the OEM battery that came with my camera. The car charger works great and will recharge a battery quite quickly, as does the wall charger. The chargers also will recharge the OEM battery. 
16268 3 Great camera for the price point. But if you plan to use AUTO mode instead of MANUAL, you will NOT be able to record to 2 SD cards simultaneously. If you like dual slot recording, so you ll always have a backup, it only works in Manual mode. 
16269 4 good product 
16270 4 as described. Thanks! 
16271 3 All perfect 
16272 4 Nice quality product. Delivered on time. 
16273 2 My pen came in and the camera was sunk down inside the barrel of the pen... I was able to align it.. For what it is, it works pretty good 
16274 4 Packing spares! 
16275 4 Exacly what i needed 
16276 4 Eliminates the sun problems you have with the gopro. 
16277 4 This thing is solid! Make sure to push the mount firmly against your surface then engage the lever to suck in the cup. Really good mount. I feel no worries putting my gopro on it. 
16278 4 Nice product for the price. Pictures look clear, sharp image. Easy to use. 
16279 4 i love this camera, excelent product 
16280 3 I use it for snowboarding. no problem. 
16281 4 Perfect for the job 
16282 3 not bad for the price 
16283 4 Great product. Fit perfectly with slik 6600. Received when expected. 
16284 3 Is a excelent len for a good price. 
16285 4 It s a good deal! The price is very reasonable. Both the battery and charger work great. I used the battery for over 5 hours in my Sony camcorder. The charger is so convenient for traveling which included a European adapter plug and a car charger. 
16286 2 software is weak camera better 
16287 4 Hopefully people can see my music is tethered to my brain. - John Mayer 
16288 4 Great item, burt I haven t used it since I struggled with how to get it going and no instructions came with it. Still I am happy I purchased it, just need some digital assistance. 
16289 4 Great value! 
16290 0 The ad said it fits Canon Cameras, I wanted it for my X, does not fit, wasted my money 
16291 4 Perfect piece feels very well made 
16292 4 Works as needed 
16293 3 Good quality product. A little heavy but offers a lot of protection. 
16294 3 Goog size. And seems robust. 
16295 1 Did not consistently work. Tried using the expensive Energizer batteries that would last longer, and the camera wouldn t turn on. Goes through normal batteries exceptionally fast. Pictures were acceptable, but with it not working much of the time, my son (to whom we gifted this item) was constantly disappointed/frustrated. 
16296 4 I love the camera. Easy to use, Arrived very fast. Faster than expected. The camera itself is a very pretty red. I love all the items that came with it as well. 
16297 4 perfect for the camera I have! well worth the price. 
16298 4 Very happy, Use in Hot Tub, & At night lights up water really well. 
16299 4 The remote worked well. It came on time. 
16300 4 Excellent 
16301 2 pictures are not very sharp 
16302 4 Cute DSLR for entry level users. Small and light enough to carry with you for traveling and sight-seeing purpose. 
16303 4 Very nice camera especially for the money I paid. Took about 5 minutes to set up. Easy to use with the app on my phone. Color, tilt, pan all work very well. Can check house when away, see if kids are home etc 
16304 4 but wow i got it like 2 years ago and iam still using it untill now !! 
16305 4 works nicely 
16306 4 They are great. 
16307 0 The cable I received was not RG59. The video wire was as thin as the power wire. There were no writing on the cable as illustrated. It would not have handed the elements. I Returned it and amazon gave me a refund. 
16308 4 Hard to use underwater but sit gave a better idea of what was really in your lens view verse guessing! Can t give info on battery life over yet but maybe down the road. Glad I have it as I do not like using my cellphone as a screen. 
16309 3 Great bang for buck 
16310 3 i got a deal on it to give my honest opinion. very cute one!! fo my daughter s BD gift! her dream camera! 
16311 3 Was absolutely wonderful for our trip to Europe. I wish the back pack itself was waterproof and didn t need a cover. That would have a earned the back pack five stars. 
16312 4 Very nice. Just what I needed. 
16313 0 Box was opened and look used. was missing the instruction manual. A 356 page book on how to use this very complicated piece of technology. Not happy.. not sure of the authenticity of the product. Zero stars If that was available. 
16314 4 Great spares for my Geek Pro. Hold a charge just fine. Perfect to have for vacations and long trips. Love it 
16315 4 This camera is awesome! The close-up picture are crisp and clear. An excellent purchase in my book! 
16316 3 functions well 
16317 4 Excellent value for the price. Easy to set up and use with iPad. The most helpful reviews were correct. 
16318 4 good product 
16319 4 great speedlight! 
16320 2 The album is exactly what I was looking for but the rings don t line up properly. 
16321 4 Thin and quick charger for Fuji batteries! 
16322 4 This kit has been just what I needed to make my Nikon work better than imagined. 
16323 0 Initially very impressed with how sturdy bracket is. After two months of use, the bracket remains unchanged and is still very sturdy. However, the mounting screw snapped off. I wished it was made with a more robust material. 
16324 4 I was extremely please with these lens bags. Thick neoprene fabric yet flexible enough to give when I put them in my camera backpack. Best inexpensive investment for my lens. The assorted sizes are perfect!!! 
16325 4 Great camera! Pictures turn out great! 
16326 1 The small tripod will not hold my Nikon D7100 upright. The other tripods are fine. Just the small one is bad. 
16327 4 works perfectly 
16328 0 The thing broke on the first day. Piece of trash. You get what you pay for. 
16329 4 Nice addition to a blackrapid camera strap to hold memory cards, batteries, etc. 
16330 4 Excellent 
16331 4 it works great , nice and clear transfer 
16332 2 I was actually surprised how easy the Nikon D3200 was to use. I was always worried that I wouldn t be able to take good pictures without a lot of studying the manual and a lot of time playing with the camera. 
16333 4 love it just what I need 
16334 4 Thank You for the fast service. The bag fits the camera and the price was great! 
16335 4 Great ball head! A wonderful addition to my gear. 
16336 0 The worst DVR and camera system I ever used, and I have installed hundreds. 
16337 4 Real nice 
16338 4 Great camara. 
16339 4 Everything you need all in one happy little box!! 
16340 4 Works great. I can use my old manual focus Nikon lenses on my Sony A7 now. I did add some shims to get infinity focus exactly right, but then I m picky about that sort of thing. Most photographers wouldn t even notice that. 
16341 0 So irritated! I bought this flash and had it shipped quickly to use for a wedding for my second shooter and it did not work. The battery would not charge and decided to swell up. Not worth $100. 
16342 4 very good charger ! 
16343 4 works good 
16344 4 Great kit you will get almost everything you will need. Great price 
16345 4 This set of camera is valuable, I love it :) 
16346 1 Just cheap. Brand new item but buttons almost broken. Not worth the price. I should ve gotten a Kidde or First Alert at a similar price. My mistake. 
16347 4 Its wire for a specific function. What more can I say? 
16348 4 They are great!! 
16349 1 never could get it to work properly. could be due to weak wifi signal 
16350 4 Bought as an additional battery. Thumbs up. 
16351 4 Very compact and nice 
16352 0 Didn t work 
16353 4 Perfect 
16354 2 This type of shoe mount is OK. I like the Frio better. 
16355 4 love this lense , its alittle heavy but does a great job 
16356 4 One of first Smatree accessories I purchased and have been impressed since day one. Everything is super solid, no play or slack. Feels great, easy to extend and retract. 
16357 0 This IS NOT the Hoya HMC haze UV(0) filter even though the title says so and so does the picture. The description clearly says it s the newer and not as good UV(C) version. Beware since Amazon seems unwilling to change the title or the image. 
16358 4 Handy to have for those &#34;necessary&#34; pictures a vacation needs. 
16359 4 Great inexpensive product. I used them to bypass my alarm window sensors and they worked perfectly. 
16360 4 So far so good! My son is a fan. This camera was easy to use right out of the box! Great price great video and great pictures! 
16361 4 Great product and so much fun for our grandson riding on his bike taking videos... he loves it! 
16362 4 Excellent screen protector, fits perfectly, easy to install, seems almost impossible to scratch. 
16363 4 I have to say.... for the money ... you can t beat this. I can take pictures sharp as a tack with great effect. Don t be afraid of a manual lens. Lots of fun! 
16364 3 Quick shipping and works as expected. One down side, gets dirty quickly and may leave smears. 
16365 1 The item does not fit the flash head of Metz 52 AF-1 Digital flash as it is supposed to. It is certainly not a snug fit. Maybe I should have gone for a Stofen unit (which incidentally was unavailable on Amazon). 
16366 3 Held about 1.5-2 hr on non stop recording at 4K 
16367 4 Everything I expected Thank you 👍 
16368 4 great product 
16369 4 Arrived quickly. The fish eye has some vignetting, but the close up and wide are great. 
16370 4 This battery has given me no problems at all! It is my backup for my nikon d5300! 
16371 2 Could be better...... Some of the pictures are blurry..... but overall great camera for regular pcitures 
16372 4 Really solid, easy to adjust, stands on its own - greatly reduces tripod need, speeds up a shoot for sure 
16373 4 Incredible service and great product. This is well built and the service was excellent. I will be purchasing more items in the future from Digital Goja for sure. Using the product on my Nikon right now and love it. 
16374 4 This is great for taking pictures of my food products. Easy to set up, take down, and takes up very little space in storage. 
16375 3 It came on time & my daughter loves it :) 
16376 4 Just what I needed. Great quality, fits perfectly on screen. 
16377 4 Everyone that see it wants to know where I bought it. I love it 
16378 4 The charger is inexpensive, well built, easy to use and is very convenient for charging the Olympus battery. Highly recommended. Also, Kastar customer service is excellent. 
16379 4 I lost my lens cap. This one works. There isn t much to say. 
16380 3 Haven t had a chance to use but better than paying for batteries. Uninterrupted power supply. 
16381 4 Nice product! 
16382 4 Awesome camera just what I expected. Everything in the kit is high quality well except for the tripod. Great extra batterie also. 
16383 4 Great video quality! More bang for your buck!! 
16384 4 Great drone for the price. I got it in a week. 
16385 0 Disappointed that the battery does not fit the charger very well unless you manuever it in such a way that contact is made. It should a snug fit. 
16386 0 I couldn´t use the selfie stick. It is not compatible with gopro cameras. 
16387 4 Product exactly as advertised and works as it should. 
16388 4 Extremely effective, these clean much faster than others that I ve used. Love the little reusable pouches and the screen buddy is a nice touch. 
16389 2 My Sony wouldn t screw on tight, it was loose. Other than that it was a great mini tripod to use to capture pictures of the whole family on a timer. I also tried to screw on an attachment to hold a cell phone but that fit loose as well. 
16390 4 NICE PRODUCT 
16391 3 Story evolves learning more about the character of each in every episode. 
16392 4 As advertised 
16393 3 Easy to setup, easy to use, highly recommend this product 
16394 4 For a pocket size camera, I am simply amazed. I can t get enough of it on my days off. Definitely wish I had gotten it earlier. 
16395 4 Used it this weekend in Paris. Amazing photo and video quality. I highly recommend this camera for traveling with friends. 
16396 3 I LIKE THE PRICE AND THE QUALITY 
16397 4 love my new receiver 
16398 4 Great camera, worth the money 
16399 4 as advertised 
16400 4 is a must if you have a celestron telescope, well worth it 
16401 4 Vincent did a great job taking care of our problem! 
16402 0 Product arrived without extendable pole which was one of the main items. Plastic is also very weak. Was very disappointed as I had no time to return product before using it on vacation 
16403 4 They are just what we needed 
16404 4 Its easy to use and it lasts a long time. 
16405 4 Henry was very helpful in assisting me in setting up the R2 camera on my PC and my iPhone. The R2 camera is very clear when viewing and it is physically smaller than what I had expected. The small size will be easier to conceal for surveillance. 
16406 4 nice lens - funny bokeh, sharp center ... definietly not sharp sides ;) ideal for having fun :) 
16407 4 Already shot 2 weddings and am very happy. Huge improvement over the SB-800. 
16408 0 Item arrived open inside shipping box and power supply did not work. I returned product. 
16409 1 Don t have proper lens to utilize it think first before buying one 
16410 4 The savings of buying in bulk really helps the pocketbook. 
16411 4 I m glad I bought this tripod/ mono pod. It is so handy, very light and easy to use. I always bring it with me whenever I bring my camera. 
16412 4 Great! 
16413 3 Good buy 
16414 3 I have not had the occasion to use it. But it appeared to be a good investment. 
16415 4 Very pleased 
16416 4 Amazing value! 
16417 4 A great alternative to Home Secretary 
16418 4 Great purchase! 
16419 0 Product delivered...but only lasts 20 min. really cheap product 
16420 2 Everything came as expected, but, head strap is missing bolt to screw GoPro into, therefore, I was unable to use it snorkeling over the weekend... Chest cam worked great, and selfie stick was nice. Other than the flaw in the head strap, I like what I got. 
16421 4 It fits great on camera. Rubber grip is similar to the camera, very good materials 
16422 0 Didn t fit my Olympus camerea 
16423 3 Very Good 
16424 2 I really like the product, but when it detects motion it says so where the clocks suppose to be, so if the person the camera detects sees the motion detected (clock) they ll know their being recorded 
16425 2 Camera takes good pictures but has a slow response. This is the only downside to this camera. 
16426 4 I LOVE IT! 
16427 4 Works great on my Nikon D7200 just as the review stated. All functions work and both batteries are displayed on the menu 
16428 3 Just took it on a European vacation. The straps up front don t close easily it besides this it s solid, inconspicuous camera bag and it looks great 
16429 4 [[ASIN:B00004WCGF Canon Deluxe Gadget Bag 100EG]] A little bit smaller than I had hoped but I managed to get everything snugged in. All in all a quality case and definitely up to the task of protecting my camera. 
16430 4 I really like this spotting scope for its compact size and clarity. I m having a custom soft case made for it. Pentax would enhance its sales if they were to produce and distribute it with a soft case. 
16431 3 This unit was purchased to replace a Canon ZR80 that burnt out. Suprisingly the ZR80 had slightly better picture quality than this one. Where this camera excels is it s easy to use features and menus. 
16432 3 Just as described. Works great. With screen was touch screen. Other than that, it works as good as my old one. 
16433 2 I can t really say that this modifier made a pointedly noticeable change but every little bit helps and My flash DOES seem a tad more controlled when on camera. 
16434 0 the battery does not work, it goes out in a minute of use. where I can buy a new battery. 
16435 3 Had all the bells and whistles plus more. 
16436 4 Fits as the original. Buy several as they come off easily. 
16437 3 Double zipper tabs would be nice, but overall it s hard to beat the price/value. Beefy strap and good weather resistance too. 
16438 4 Camera is working great Customer service agent Walter - was very helpful to get it set-up 
16439 4 Good 
16440 3 Fantastic product at a very reasonable price, i simply love it 
16441 4 Great camera at a good price. The variable zoom is perfect for pointing down my drive way. The camera arrived quickly with everything intact and working. 
16442 3 Works Good. 
16443 4 good charger 
16444 4 Love it 
16445 4 Thanks! 
16446 4 This thing works and is ideal. 
16447 0 leaked and cost me my go-pro, yes should have done a dry run, seamed durable and I was just snorkeling so figured this was my test before an actual dive. like the more durable clasp compared to the original housing. complete crap DO NOT BUY! 
16448 4 Battery fits well and works fine 
16449 4 This was the best a Big Bang for my buck!! I use everything here!! Can t wait to order more!! 
16450 1 I don t use mine very often and am disappointed that one of the straps had torn off already. Disappointing 
16451 4 We bought these at a reasonable price. They don t last as long as the name brand but are a great bargain anyway. 
16452 4 Good quality lens cloths. 
16453 0 Camera is excellent, software is terrible and very cumbersome. 
16454 2 Good Deal! 
16455 4 Bought this for my 15 year old son. It has a ton of gadgets in it. He loves it! 
16456 4 This was a Christmas present. 
16457 4 I used this camera on a trip out West to Yellowstone NP and most of the pictures taken were excellent. 
16458 4 This mount holds very tightly and I am glad that I bought it. I have this mount as well as the GoPro one and the BRLS is a lot sturdier than the GoPro suction mount. 
16459 1 its cumbersome to take the camera out. I replaced this item with an other product. 
16460 4 Good zoom 
16461 4 This is the best.... I just the pictures!!! I don t leave home with out it. 
16462 4 Granddaughter is thrilled, camera works great! 
16463 4 Works perfectly as a replacement for the OEM battery at 1/3 the cost. 
16464 4 Works beautifully and I got it for a good price! 
16465 3 Works well. Cannot find charger. 
16466 4 They are good batteries, work great. 
16467 4 Ordered this for our office to take passport pictures for students. This is easy to use. And will be an asset to the office. 
16468 4 Item as described and works well. Arrived on time. 
16469 1 Didn t fit my speed rings. 
16470 4 bought too many! wanna buy one from me? 
16471 4 Essential for your grab bag 
16472 4 Fits my 70D perfectly and worked awesome. The color is not far off from my 70d so it really looks like the more expensive models 
16473 2 Great backpack. Only gave it three starts because its not as handy as a messenger bag style when it comes to switching lenses on the move. 
16474 4 Excellent!! 
16475 4 Arrived just as expected! Looking forward to integrating these into our September wedding as an interactive medium for guests. Thank you for the prompt shipping! 
16476 3 Batteries fit perfectly into charger and camera. They don t hold a charge for as long as the original batteries, but they are great as back ups. 
16477 4 Very good. 
16478 4 Such an amazing combo for a great price. Not one regret about this purchase! 
16479 4 great 
16480 4 Works GREAT! 
16481 2 thank you.. 
16482 4 perfect 
16483 4 Fast shipping, pleased with purchase. 
16484 3 Easy installment.. could use a touch of threadlocker. 
16485 4 Meets my needs and very sterdy 
16486 4 This battery is just as good as the original Canon types. Three years an still no issues. If you need this battery, stop now and just buy it all ready. 
16487 1 Very disappointing interior material s quality. 
16488 0 Doesn t come close to doing what it s supposed to plus there s no directions. Very shotty 
16489 4 Works great for the price, effortless setup. The mobile app is nice and it provides just what you need. My only regret is that I did not get the 8 channel DVR. 
16490 4 Go pro?! WHY?!!!! This does the same thing, and is AWESOME! I use it on my drone, and it can take a BEATING so far! The waterproof case makes this a GREAT purchase! GET IT! 
16491 1 Hood doesn t screw on well. 
16492 3 Had to return the first unit due to not functioning second unit received a working perfectly fine 
16493 4 Works great--is exactly what i wanted. 
16494 4 Nice bag 
16495 4 Calvin did a great job hooking up my camera to the cloud Foscam lets me keep an eye on my property 
16496 4 Very good quality for the price, don t forget to buy a micro SD card to go with it, though! 
16497 4 This thing is really impressive, built like a tank. Holds over 200 lbs - i can believe it. I got it to hold a video slider super low and it will do that all day. Over bulty but light and packable. Great niche product 
16498 4 Just Great! 
16499 4 Great product, very nice quality and works as it should 
16500 4 Who does not love extra batteries! 
16501 0 This battery is marked as 1300mAh, not 1600mAh as described. 
16502 4 fits everything perfectly 
16503 4 As advertised 
16504 4 The kids had a blast playing with this waterproof camera on our recent vacations. It s definitely critical that you buy a &#34;floater&#34; so you don t lose it to the depths of the pool or ocean. 
16505 4 Is a great price for this camera 
16506 1 When playing &#34;random&#34; photos and with the motion detection &#34;on&#34; the screen freezes black after some time... But when the unit plays photos sequentially there is no problem with the motion detection. Not very happy and not likely to suggest this product to anyone else. 
16507 4 Good product and a fantastic seller A++++++ 
16508 4 perfect 
16509 3 Product was as described, and arrived on time. 
16510 2 Workscas advertised. My issue though is the thing to tighten the flash could be sturdier. 
16511 1 And turns everything blue. I live in LA and wouldn t purchase again 
16512 4 Very good 
16513 0 Is not a great camera. I have had issues with my pics being blurry. I wish I had sprung for a better camera now Im stuck with this one for awhile. 
16514 4 Product is excellent and fast shipping!!! Thanks 
16515 3 Not the most stable tri pod 
16516 3 This looks and operates like a GoPro3 for a lot less money. nice accessories. Be sure and purchase no more than a 32GB micro memory card. The documentation is a bit weak, but there are a lot of videos online to walk you through the operation of this 1080P camera. 
16517 4 Very good. 
16518 4 i am ashamed to say i love this product. you might have trouble getting it to take pictures if you have an older phone, but you can download an app. 
16519 4 Thanks so much. Fast shipping and great product :) 
16520 4 Great Seller Super! 
16521 4 Perfect 
16522 4 product is as described, well machined, works perfectly. either by hand or a coin. 
16523 3 Thank you, very happy with the management of purchase - sale. 
16524 2 I found that the optical quality was poor. See attached sample. I bought this for moving water photos so maybe it won t matter in &#34;real world&#34; imaging, but I m disappointed. 
16525 4 Loved it 
16526 2 Smaller than expected but I guess good for the price 
16527 3 Takes awhile to get used to taking photos without a viewfinder or screen. Picture quality is quite good, I was particularly impressed with underwater shots. 
16528 4 i love this camera i ts one of the best. you can basically do anything that you can do on an Android cell phone including making and receiving calls with your google account, facebook messenger, oovoo, skype. i just wish it had a sim card slot 
16529 4 It s really light and fits so much gear! Genius design! 
16530 4 Got it 
16531 4 Awesome product very pleased 
16532 2 Extra to my needs at this time. 
16533 3 love the zoom. Have not been able to get the wifi to work yet, so hopefully it will. overall, takes great photos. 
16534 4 This thing is very well made and highly recommended 
16535 4 Great value. Well delivered. Thank you 
16536 1 Easy to use and mount.. But this is not what i expected... 
16537 4 great light,can carry it around in your pocket! great product. 
16538 4 Great little camera. 
16539 0 They don t fit Sony RX-10, contrary to what you read! I should have paid attention to some of the other reviewers who commented on inaccurate sizing. Both batteries I purchased stick and I had to use needle-nose pliers to remove them! Bummer! 
16540 4 Very nice protection for the lenses. Very usefull. 
16541 4 very good product, peace of mind for your much more expensive lens. (drop test: my daughter played around with the filter and accidentally unscrewed it from the lens and it dropped 1 m down to the hard concrete floor, and it did not break, nor scratch. Maybe I was lucky). 
16542 3 takes nice pictures and i easy to use 
16543 4 Fits my 430 EX perfectly! 
16544 4 Youtube channel: http://youtube.com/teainthetreesbp I get constant messages about the quality of my videos. EVERYTHING is filmed on that channel with this camera. I will probably buy the next one when it comes out. Best hd camera I ve owned. 
16545 4 Nice protection. 
16546 4 I got this one to replace an older one that was going on five years old and finally quit. It s capable of zoned operation in its sensing area to fine tune the field it monitors, and can be adjusted to only work at night. A nice little unit. 
16547 4 Great product 
16548 0 Nice idea but not use friendly. Hard to tel which mode it is in. 
16549 4 Awesome external flash! 
16550 2 The problem I had with this is that it was very easy to dislodge. A couple of times I did not notice that it had fallen off. Apart from that worked well. 
16551 1 Broken clasp as soon as I opened it. It also has a film glued to the back door. Wish I would have bought the real deal. 
16552 0 I purchased this for my father with many grand kids out of town. Although it seemed like a nice product, the software, especially the remote are terrible. This is NOT a good product for non-tech savvy individuals. I would avoid. 
16553 0 Although I had no problems connecting it to wifi, just could not get it to record to SD. 
16554 4 works great 
16555 4 I have replaced larger (too large) straps on my Olympus E-M1 and E-M5 with the Leash Camera Straps from Peak Design. I like the concept, size and weight and they are easily adjusted to a different length. Just perfect for the mirrorless cameras. 
16556 4 Pretty simple mount and work perfect 
16557 4 This is a fantastic lens at an affordable price. I have been having so much fun photographing everything from grandchildren to wildlife to butterflies! Easy to handle without using tripod. 
16558 4 Delivered as stated, packaging was great and batteries charged and work in my camera. 
16559 4 Great unit charges two batteries at the same time unlike other chargers. Speedy delivery! 
16560 4 I was totally amazed of how small and easy to handle, is the FotoTech ML-L3 Wireless Shutter Release Remote, I could not have been any happier. I had other type of remote before and this is absolutely the best, my congratulations to FotoTech. 
16561 4 Package came exactly as ordered. I needed the batteries and charger more than the cleaning supplies, but it is nice to have a fresh cleaning kit to go with a new camera! I always like to have a spare battery handy. 
16562 1 No. Very Silly. No where near loud enough. 
16563 4 Precisely what I needed to replace my older Lumix (also with Leica lens.) It s my fourth Lumix and as each is replaced I give it to one of my granddaughters. That way I get razor sharp pictures of my family. 
16564 4 This case is pretty nice! I am quite happy with this purchase. 
16565 4 I got this battery charger today and plugged my Nikon J3 battery into it. Worked great. Fast shipping and a third the price of a replacement from Nikon. I m a happy customer. 
16566 4 This case works wonderfully with my DSLR. I have a 55-300mm lens that fits well in this case while attached to my camera. I have brought it along while traveling internationally and it did a great job at protecting my camera. 
16567 4 Works great and a great price for the functions. 
16568 4 Great fun for my wife 
16569 3 GoPro equivalent w/ Camera viewing/controlling & file downloads wirelessly on phone (Droid or iPhone) or tablet through App. App allows you to take pictures remotely, view screen is low quality (circa 2001 digital cameras) but the picture/video quality (3000x4000 option available) is very good! 
16570 3 Excellent stuff. Canon makes good cameras. The bag is actually pretty good as everything from this kit that I will use fits just fine. The mini tripod is pretty much useless for a camera of this size. 
16571 3 awesome 
16572 1 just cant find a way to square them up to my eyes properly - really don t understand it because having owned about 10 different sets of binoculars over the last 40+ years, these ones just don t allow unobstructed vision in any adjustment range. its weird. 
16573 4 This is a great tripod! 
16574 4 Very helpful & handy! 
16575 4 Seems to be working fine. 
16576 4 Must have if you use the Sony RX100III, Affordable. I always have a spare batt in my pocket when I m carrying my Sony. 
16577 3 Cute product. Some stickers didn t stick well but others did. I would buy again with other designs. 
16578 3 The case is made of steel and, although gives protection to the PCB, adds a lot of weight to an FPV system. Better video quality than many others- I still use it on my 250quad 
16579 4 If you just want a case that could keep your GoPro and some basic accessories safe and with a minimal size at the same time, this is it. 
16580 4 Real bargin 
16581 2 Not a bad camera, but the color is way off! It works, connects is easy to use but the picture quality is very low and it does not display colors correctly. 
16582 1 It not the type of charger that will charge your battery? It took long time to get my camcorder charged enough to work right? I would like to find an original one for my camcorder instead. 
16583 4 This is a fun thing to have, but it is very hard to find anywhere to buy the film. 
16584 4 Excellent versatility. Out of the few I have seen this seems to be the most durable as well. 
16585 4 simple but effective 
16586 0 Only the clock worked. Web camera did not work. Recording camera did not record. It was a very expensive clock, that s all! 
16587 2 One battery wouldn t. They replaced it quickly. No complaints 
16588 4 Buy one! Having so much fun with this. Seems to work with all of my lenses, minus some vignetting on certain ones. 
16589 4 great product 
16590 4 For the price you cannot go worng, It is perfect for persons who travel as it is extremely lightweight. I was a little cautious at first to put my camera on it but it held up my Canon DSLR very nicely. 
16591 4 Excellent 
16592 3 I ve never used a circular polarizer before but this seems to be doing what I need it to do. It fits nicely on my Canon SX60 and has a nice case for storage when it is not in use. I m very happy with this product. 
16593 2 bulky 
16594 4 As opposed to other reviewers, I see no jumps or jerks with this. it just plain works. the 5-minute 360-degree is good for getting quick interior rotations. It is now an essential part of my kit. dead easy to use. 
16595 2 I did not use the stand up tripod but the lens work great. 
16596 4 I love those things and already used them a lot. No complains! 
16597 4 Outstanding Item and fast shipping. 
16598 0 does *not* work for my new d3300 or mh-24 charger -- it just flashes rapidly. nikon website says this means defective battery. 
16599 4 Just what I needed. 
16600 0 This item does not work. I have bought it two seperate times and continue to have the same problem. Will Not Turn on, never even got a chance to test the quality. Very Disappointed. 
16601 4 Item delivered in a timely manner and was just as described on the web site. 
16602 4 Does the job of replacing one I lost while working on a window. No fiddling necessary. 
16603 3 Works like a champ. Good quality. Shipped quickly. 
16604 4 AWESOME! Worked great for fast lens changes while doing street photography! 
16605 4 Love it !!! And the delivery was awesome!!! 
16606 4 Good 
16607 1 The product is not set up easily by the average home owner, and the instructions do not tell you how to connect to your home wireless network, instead directing you to the company s cloud service. Only one smart phone can be connected--a product limitation. 
16608 4 Lens caps fit perfectly on my T3i and seem like they are an even better fit than the Cannon cover that came with the lens. 
16609 4 My wife loves it, enough said 
16610 1 Disappointing Night view not as expected No better than the 700TVL and 450TVL cameras that I have already 
16611 3 Does the job, but inserting a battery is tricky, I have to juggle it and make may attempts before the battery will go in. Something is not quite correct with the physical interface between the charger and the battery. 
16612 0 The lenses are loose and the glass actually rattles around. I am going to return them and order something better. 
16613 4 Worked like new right out of the box as it should. Still using it a year later and i m still very happy with my purchase. 
16614 4 Everything fits good, works good. No complaints here. 
16615 1 Didn t work for my Canon SX280 which has a known battery flaw, nice package otherwise though from other reviews the fast charger may cause problems. 
16616 4 I love this Camera..... 
16617 4 Nice backdrop. 
16618 4 Great product, 
16619 0 After installing this product, your nice bright camera screen becomes a blurry &#34;frosted glass&#34; hardly usable mess. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I put it on a brand new Nikon Coolpix AW130 and removed it promptly. Its like looking thru steamed up glasses. I returned it to Amazon for refund. 
16620 0 Don t use the wrist mount I lost my hero 4 at the lake in the water the top of the part of the mount that spins broke off warning not use it 
16621 4 so thankful I found these 
16622 3 This drone is a bit difficult to control and camera quality isn t great so I mounted a gopro and got amazing footage. This thing goes out of control in soft winds!!! 
16623 4 This remote works wonderfully with my DSLR. It s very handy to have for photos taken with a tripod- much more convenient than self timer. 
16624 3 I don t know if the Energizer name is the same as the battery manufacturer but the price and multi-type card use capability caught my interest for the task ahead of me. 
16625 0 The audio/sound is bad. The capability to hear whats going on thru the app is very static. The microphone capabilty to talk thru the app to the device doesnt work at all. 
16626 4 Fits my Nikon D600 perfectly. 
16627 3 Works well. I ve purchased 3 so far. 
16628 4 Nice to be able to still get this film. Worked fine. 
16629 4 Excellent quality at a very reasonable price. 
16630 3 Good buy 
16631 4 Great trigger. 
16632 4 Ok 
16633 3 Good replacement parts. Both charged up very well. 
16634 4 Even when you are in others place,you also can keep closer to your house,your loved people any time by your phone or PC. 
16635 4 kenneth was very very helpful. He was very knowledgable about the foscam products and got me up and running in no time. 
16636 3 It worked great. My battery was charged in no time 
16637 4 Item arrived on time and works well. I have used it for sports photography and like it much better than the neck strap. 
16638 2 its ok 
16639 4 Great product, exactly what I was looking for! Excellent customer service. Highly recommend this case as a travel case for your GoPro... 
16640 3 Fix perfect to my AZ1. 
16641 4 This was bought as a backup in case my battery ran down and I had no place to recharge my camera. 
16642 1 they are very weak 
16643 4 Does the job....thanks!!! 
16644 4 Amazing camera and the best customer service I have seen in a very long time! 
16645 4 IDEAL! 
16646 4 Light weight, but solid. Exactly what I needed to attach my video light to my c-stand for a halo light. 
16647 4 love it 
16648 3 I love the feel of this little camera in my hands! Be careful with charging it though! Easy carry and fits in a small purse. 
16649 0 It is a garbage, can not be used. 
16650 0 Bought two of these, but neither works with the Foscam 9805w. The cables seem to fit, but not delivering any electricity. 
16651 4 Awesome product. Exactly like the original Gopro 
16652 4 Perfect for our SLR, very sleek and compact to do day trips with. Rain fly is clutch. There is no room for any other gear you want to carry, except for very small essential accessories like a battery, a lens cap, or things equally flat and small. 
16653 4 AWESOME!!!! 
16654 2 EXCELLENT, No complaints 
16655 4 Easy to use and everything you need 
16656 4 Perfect size. High quality photos. Love it! 
16657 3 I would have given it 5 stars -- delivered fast, packaged well -- but time will tell how they last. But so far, so good! 
16658 4 Just as I expected. 
16659 4 Excelente 
16660 1 Not worth buying! Came very wrinkled and you can not iron it. 
16661 4 Nice slim, filter. 
16662 4 Alsome works with vision 2 
16663 4 Super fast shipping! Great product! 
16664 4 INCREDIBLE. HUGE. GREAT VALUE-- high quality--- these have taken my portraits to another level. 
16665 4 Built-in Z-Wave Plus! Can t get better than that. 
16666 4 Great for the price. Real sturdy. 
16667 3 Sturdy Construction. Good resultas as of today. 
16668 4 Great product 
16669 4 I love using this! It is the best product! 
16670 0 Do not buy if you re going to be cliff-jumping or any sports or similar nature 
16671 4 Works like a Nikon lc-52 snap front lens cap should😏 
16672 4 Works great!!! 
16673 4 Arrived quickly- works great with my Nikon D3200 and I love that it also comes with the car adapter to charge on the go! 
16674 4 A++++ super deal! super fast delivery WOW 2 days from the order to being at my door! 
16675 4 Solid fast good product. 
16676 4 Accurate, fast, quality construction. 
16677 4 very good. thanks. 
16678 4 Fantastic camera, better than I hoped for!! 
16679 4 Didn t need all of them, but down the road am sure I will use them 
16680 4 Everything was as promised. Thanks! 
16681 4 Good and economical at less than $15 
16682 3 These are great! Totally real looking, I trembled when I got them the package. I left my own house, before I called the police. They are big chunky and totally sell the gag. 
16683 2 Before buying good filters I wanted to try this package to see how I would like using filters. This package gave me some good options to learn and work with filters. If anything the adopter ring alone were worth the price. 
16684 4 great 
16685 4 Great lens and excellent price! Timely delivery. Included one year international warranty. I registered the lens online. The lens delivers sharp pictures, typical Nikon quality. 
16686 4 Great 
16687 4 great cd on how to use the camera 
16688 4 SOOOO much fun and easy to use. Have not tried to add my camera yet. 
16689 4 I love the ability to change the color with the gels. For video work, I use the blue for daylight color temperature. 
16690 4 so far so good, and it it arrived in a most timely manner. many thanks. 
16691 2 having trouble with the auto focus...servos will not operate. anxious about warranty 
16692 4 This is a great lens for the price. No need to go into great detail because if your a beginner like me it just goes over your head. However you can trust at this price point the lens will not disappoint! Get it. Great Value good quality. 
16693 0 It took the same quality pictures as before. 
16694 4 Patrick at Foscam support did a wonderful job of helping me to install and understand the IP camera. I thank him very much!!This is one of the best outdoor IP cameras made. Can t wait to get it mounted!! Thanks!! 
16695 4 Always got to have a spare! 
16696 0 horrible product. Felt very cheaply made and has little to no projection of light. It barely iluminates the corner of a 5x5 room. 
16697 4 Looks like a real camera and the red link blinks brightly at night 
16698 3 Works well on my non Nikon Flash 
16699 0 I am very disappointed with camera and am returning it I am not able to access it all day but. Half of the time when I try, it gives me &#34;Connect Timeout&#34;. It s a disappointment. 
16700 4 Unbelievably great price and exactly what I was hoping for. I will be grabbing a second one for travel, so I can do two at once. With the X100T a notoriously awful battery performance, at least it s cheap to buy extra power. 
16701 4 I haven t had much chance to use this item, but I m glad I purchased it at a wonderful price. I love the red color and it will be used quite a bit during my next trip. 
16702 4 Exactly what i wanted, exactly what i thought it was and what i needed it to do. Great product and great transaction. 
16703 4 GOOD PRICE 
16704 4 Works great, fast shipping, reasonable price. 
16705 4 I lost exactly the same camera and bought this as a replacement. I love it. 
16706 0 Waist of money 
16707 4 Battery s last just as long as official gopro batteries, and so convenient to charge 2 at a time... I have 6 batteries total since the life is so short on the gopro 
16708 4 works great and lasts longer than the gopro battery that came with the camera. 
16709 4 works great never have to charge batteries just plug the camera right into the wall 
16710 4 Works good for the price but the instructions are not not well documented and be sure to get a SD memory card for it. 
16711 0 2 the 4 no good they was used moters 
16712 4 Satisfied with the product. Should have gotten sooner. Just got it. Hope it lasts. 
16713 4 These batteries worked perfect for my Canon Vixia M500. The charger work good and charges fairly quick. Would buy again. 
16714 4 Easy to set up right out of the box. Couldn t be happier with it! 
16715 4 This small battery is perfect! The old one (that we had to use) was rather large and bulky - but it came with the camcorder (gift). Thank you!!! 
16716 4 I think some of the people need stronger fingers or use a tool to tighten the clamp. It works well. I have no problems. 
16717 4 Great product. 
16718 4 Used right after I received the package. Very happy about the purchase. Would recommend to friends. 
16719 4 worked as should thanks 
16720 4 LOVE the Samsung NX3000 and all the lenses I ve purchased for it. A great go-to camera, small in size, that delivers top-quality photos. 
16721 0 Not what is advertised. AT ALL. Trust me, if you re looking for a Sj4000L, this is not it. 
16722 4 fits into a laptop sized bag nicely, very sturdy when fully extended. Overall very happy with the stand. 
16723 0 Sonys mounts are crap.... And half of them are discontinued.... Buy a go pro 
16724 4 Great product, works great and does exactly what it is suppose to do. 
16725 4 Great 
16726 4 Fit perfectly 
16727 4 I need it. It was delivered quickly. So I m happy. 
16728 3 The mounts provided with the camera are somewhat useful in most cases, but difficult to adapt for non-typical applications. Camera works well, and very good quality video. 
16729 0 it is broken and does not work and no one has returned my calls to replace it. and my name is not richard, I am BJ at bjdaneshfar@gmail.com BJD 
16730 4 Fast service and great price. 
16731 3 Great rain/dust cover but unfortunately it is too large for my Nikon D3100. Thank you for the fast shipping!! 
16732 4 Does a good job of lighting up the front door for the security cameras. Cheap but works...I m happy. 
16733 4 Excellent value and amazing performance. My money was well spent! It is still flying well with no damage after 40+ flights of 7 minutes each.. 
16734 4 Ordered 5 p.m. and received 11 a.m. the next day. AMAZING!! The batteries came fully charged and carefully packaged. They fit into the camera perfectly (Casio x-s10). I can t tell you about the charger yet, but the entire purchase was 100% worth it. 
16735 4 I am very happy with this lens. It makes a great addition to my camera kit. Takes nice close-ups of flowers and plants which was my main reason in purchasing it. The filters that were sold with it are also good to have, as well as the cleaning kit. 
16736 0 Everything is blurred when the Magnifier is attached. Looks great when looking through it alone, but once attached, it s useless, unless you want blurred pictures. However, customer service was excellent o deal with. 
16737 4 Works great! 
16738 4 fits 
16739 3 It worked well for it s price. Not the best but not the worst. 
16740 4 Have been taking practice shots and the camera is very easy to use. 
16741 4 thankyou 
16742 4 Great film. 
16743 1 The metal strap was scratched (looked like a used product was sent) and crooked covering a half of the camera window, and as you can see on the picture it shows that is comes with a 16GB card what actually is a lie, there was no card at all 
16744 4 I have not had to use this protection plan but it is always good to have in case you need it. 
16745 4 This was the first flash kit ive ever bought and they work amazing! 
16746 0 The camera produced no signal, or was incompatable with my DVR of same mfr. Return process of defective product was very simple. I will probably order another 
16747 4 Have no tried it in the field yet bit seems sturdy. Using it with a Sony A5000. 
16748 4 I debated a case for the Phantom Pro 3 for about a month and am lucky I didn t damage it; this backpack works well - and keeps the unit secure. A must have to protect your gear. 
16749 0 Just received 2 of these. This item is falsely advertised it does not have 30 constant LED lights ,It has 1 very bright blinking red light. 
16750 4 It does what it s supposed to. Works fine. The tilt seems a little chintzy with the clicking you hear as it passes what I assume are &#34;notches&#34; somewhere, but it s working and tilting just fine. 
16751 4 Works great with my Canon hf g20, I only wish I had another camera so that I can purchase another on!!! 
16752 4 Battery charger works well and was a good price, too. Arrived in good shape on date when promised. 
16753 4 Had no problems with this. Worked like OE battery. I would buy another one. 
16754 0 Camera gets haze after a few months and amazon won t replace it. Not happy 
16755 4 Great product. Worked as expected. Easy enough for a 10 year old to use. So far only used on a video camera and worked without any problem. 
16756 4 gave as part of gift bag for someone with new Go Pro and they loved it! 
16757 4 I ve said it over and over.. you can t go wrong with B&W. I am tough on my gear and B&W is always there when o th her brands fail. Quality glass and top construction. 
16758 0 Was not up to the dimensions advertised and not adequate for my needs. 
16759 4 Works great .easily recharges 
16760 4 Works up to about 60 feet for me. The only negative was that it took about 3 weeks to arrive from Australia. I would order another one. The good part is that it works on a 9v battery. 
16761 1 Eh. Kinda useless. Props still broke in a pretty mild crash. 
16762 4 For the price it works great!!! 
16763 4 works good put around our garden to scare deer out 
16764 4 Butter-smooth shots with my GoPro HERO3. Easy to use, but reco buying the Neewer Feiyu 2PCS Ultra Reach Carbon Fiber poles also for some nice different POV shots. 
16765 4 great seller - delivered as promised! 
16766 0 Very poor!!!! There s no reason to buy this product/item.... 
16767 4 ok. 
16768 4 I purchased this to use my 77mm Hoya ND filter on my 67mm Canon Macro Lens. The construction is solid. I m very picky in regards to what I put on my lenses, and I have no concerns using this adapter. 
16769 4 Wasabi Power is the best aftermarket brand battery maker I have ever owned. They just work. 
16770 1 Problems with quality. Audio is crap.. 
16771 2 It s okay but doesn t add too much difference to your regular lens. 
16772 4 Great value. Cheaper then the stories 
16773 4 Excellent product!!!!! 
16774 3 Great Product 
16775 4 Product arrived quickly as promised and works as advertised. I was able to tuck the clothes into various bags etc so as to have available to use on glasses, iPads etc. 
16776 4 Bought as a gift. For the price, it s an excellent set of binoculars. Little hard to adjust for comfortable viewing, but it s not hard to use. 
16777 3 Good economy spotting scope. 
16778 4 B+W and you don t worry about IQ degradation. 
16779 4 Exception Quality Glass. Doesn t introduce vignetting and is excellent for protecting your lens in harsh conditions. 
16780 4 a good camera. this was a good purchase. 
16781 4 This thing charges well and I have 2 extra batteries. Can t ask for more because shooting in the fly and having a dead battery this will Dave you time. Hasn t failed me now. 
16782 4 sets up really quick and easy. I like the size and resolution. 
16783 4 Very good 
16784 4 Outstanding Item and fast shipping. 
16785 4 it works so no issue with it 
16786 3 Pros: - Protects lens - Inexpensive Cons: - Feels a bit bigger than original Nikon cap; fits very tightly when in place - Doesn t clamp on as quickly as original cap; falls off a couple times before staying on 
16787 3 Works as advertised. Can always use additional protection. 
16788 1 it s okay for the price you pay. getting started the filter does the job, once you know how to use these tools you ll get a better one anyway - the one that covers the spectrum you desire for the scene you re after. 
16789 4 A great inexpensive alternative for the causal or semi-professional photographer. The battery continues to run well with moderate use. 
16790 4 a good back up camera if your SLR or smartphone dies on you while you re in the middle of recording. 
16791 4 These reflectors are exactly what I was looking for... I love that they are compact for travel and store easily. 
16792 4 My experience with this product has been excellent. It was delivered on time and was exactly what I expected based on the description on the Amazon website. 
16793 4 Just what I needed before taking a trip. The camera is about 6 years old. I ve been using the original battery since then. 
16794 4 Great item 
16795 4 This is great. Cheap price and good quality. 
16796 3 very easy to mount and setup. has good depth and wide angle. very clear picture both day and night. 
16797 4 great reflector - great price - no problems with it yet! 
16798 4 This is an excellent product. Shott Glass screen protectors cost a fortune. This is a well made, and good looking, alternative that is very cost effective. I ended up buying a second for another camera. 
16799 4 Great Product 
16800 4 Has a lot of features for the price, easy to operate, I think it is a lot better than my K-7 that cost more. 
16801 4 This is one &#34;great buy&#34;. for the money. Its an easy install with great built in features and the picture quality is excellent. I would highly recommend this product for all tech enthusiasts as well as parents with newborns for monitoring. 
16802 2 doesnt last long 
16803 4 Excellent 
16804 4 If you don t have this lens yet, what are you waiting for. Its a compact lens that has amazing clarity, and with a f/1.8 you cant beat that with a stick. It has the same quality feel an look you would expect from a Canon product. 
16805 4 product good 
16806 4 The camera is easy to use and carry in your pocket. I had it my pool and it worked fine. I m happy I made the choice and got it. 
16807 4 Very comfortable and floatable. Great product and great price. 
16808 4 Item worked exactly as intended, It enabled me to take photos and video of my snorkeling adventure in the Virgin Islands without worrying that I d lose my camera! 
16809 3 Perfect for my purpose 
16810 4 they work great 
16811 4 Recommend! Quickly detects someone in its view and alerts. Bought 3 of them! Great for anywhere around your home, set tones differently and quickly isolate the area you need to check. 
16812 4 Does exactly what it s meant to at a great price. Solid build and mounts firmly. Using with a 57mm 1.4 an no issues with aperture when on the mount. 
16813 4 Perfect 
16814 3 great value 
16815 4 Worked Perfectly for my Sony DSCHX90V/B Digital Camera 
16816 4 I had some issues trying to set up my foscam, and thanks to Danny all the installation went smooth. Great customer service thank you. The camera is looking sharp and I love the HD resolution. 
16817 4 quick service, product as advertised 
16818 4 Very good stuff 
16819 3 Remove the internal spacer and the fz70 snuggly fits in the case. Seems to be well padded and decent quality. 
16820 2 These are ok. I thought they would add it little more to photos, but I think they are really more just for photo gimic. 
16821 4 So easy to use! 
16822 2 The telescope itself works well after about 20 minutes of getting used to its adjustments the tripod however is flimsy trash. I believe 3 Lincoln logs would be sturdier. So before you buy just make sure you add a tripod to your order 
16823 4 Worked as expected. 
16824 3 This protective is very good. 
16825 4 Nice 
16826 4 Brought it as a gift and they love it 
16827 4 I bought this to wear a go pro while skiing with our group. Its a great way to wear under my jacket and have a hands free platform to capture our fun. Its well made and has plenty of adjustments to accommodate many situations. 
16828 4 This is great upgrade for any basic telescope. 
16829 4 It was simple to set up, the picture is excellent, and we ve especially appreciated having it during a crazy wildfire season. It gives us peace to be able to see our serene living room from a distance. 
16830 3 Smooth transaction. Fast shipping. A+++. Thanks you!!! 
16831 4 Its solidly build all metal mount. I bought it to mount it on orion 15x70 and managed to do it and took really good pics of moon at night using this. 
16832 4 very happy with this easy to use- love the zoom - used a friends camera when we went on a cruise to Alaska took great pics- so I decided to purchase one for my next cruise- the package deal was a great find too! 
16833 3 Great solid tripod, better than expected for the price! 
16834 4 You can feel the difference by the packaging, but it won t stop there. The engineering and glass are really superior. It s worth it to have something of this quality on lenses you love and work so hard with. 
16835 1 The battery cuts out all the time. It says the battery is low then says it is full. 
16836 4 This camera works great. 
16837 4 BW the way to go 
16838 4 Very good 
16839 4 I love my new tripod, I didn t realize it would hold a camera and my phone! So affordable and it weighs close to nothing. Can t wait to take this bad boy on vacation. 
16840 3 I like it, its great for the price. It can be a little unstable when you a light and a sandbag on it raised high, its just smaller diameter metal poles. works great for a beginners boom stand though, would recommend 
16841 3 Hard to download 
16842 4 I have set them up to email me and also to ftp on my nas and it all works as it should be. 
16843 3 Works well but have had some issues using with Canon Rebel. It caused some issues with screen. Had to call Canon. Bottom line, must shut down camera totally before taking battery out. 
16844 4 The camera was as easy as the thermostat and smoke detector to set up. We had no issues. I would like ability to pan and tilt the camera remotely. 
16845 4 Works as intended! Great price too. 
16846 4 everything i expected it to be, took awhile to learn all of the settings but it is very beginner friendly. ISO above 400 or 800 gets grainy fast. 
16847 3 Works pretty well. However Feiyu support doesn t answer all questions. For example, why you can t trim the forward position even though you can trim the other axis. 
16848 4 Great Camera. I use of it for work and research. It s user friendly and very light. 
16849 4 Bought a second set of these cables and I sm very happy with the service and fast delivery. 
16850 4 I love this light box - takes a little while to put together, but worth it! I can take pictures of all the craft projects I do anytime! 
16851 0 Camera requires a ridiculous amount of focusing, pictures are blurry, it takes 3 or 5 times to get a non-blurry photo. Recording is blurry too. Just cheap and bad. It s a headache to just take one simple picture with this thing 
16852 4 Good job. 
16853 4 Great!!!!!! 
16854 4 I bought this unit when mine stopped working as a replacement , because the last time it went out, I had no phone and no internet.and I had to wait for 10 days before getting a new one from my provider, this is my backup unit. 
16855 4 excellent power for operation of camera 
16856 2 kept dropping off the network 
16857 4 Works just fine - a great lower cost alternative to the branded unit. 
16858 2 Protects the camera from Water but the audio does get muffled enough to the point where it s not very useful. Construction isn t great but it does the job 
16859 0 Horrible underwater quality, will be returning it. 
16860 3 Can t go wrong for price; primary work is macro. Bought to replace a similar unit that broke after less than a year. Only odd thing is the backside depression where your forefinger rests has locating nubs. It would be more intuitive to have the nubs on the trigger button. 
16861 4 Fast delivery! really good fit! all edges lined up. Thank you 
16862 4 Works as well as the name brand but much more economical! Please with our purchase. (Does fit tightly in the battery compartment so sometimes needs an extra push to get it to pop out). I would purchase again! 
16863 4 Seems to work as well as my OEM battery at a substantially lower price. Hard to beat that. 
16864 0 Wouldn t hold a charge longer than 20 minutes in the cold. the picture was acceptable and would have been fine if the battery would stay charged longer. 
16865 4 nice product for the price. love it. 
16866 4 bought it as a gift for my daughter, she loves it! 
16867 1 They get 2 stars because they are indeed waterproof. But picture quality is terrible- bad color, not sharp, and expensive to process (not too many film processors out there these days!). Don t waste the money unless it s for a kid to play around. 
16868 4 perfect replacement for the hood on my fuji 23mm 1.4, looks like a stock item. 
16869 3 This works great! 
16870 1 glad i got three, plastic and cheap they are i have broke 2 already hoping the 3rd one last until I get my aluminum ones i ordered 
16871 3 perfect 
16872 4 was worried that my battery would not fit.... I was delighted when it did. 
16873 4 Super socks and do stay dry. 
16874 4 I love this camera!!!! I m never without it!!!! The size is perfect and it takes the most fantastic pictures on Auto!!!! I just hold on to it!!! 
16875 0 This camera worked, but it wasn t very easy to open the compartment to change the batteries. The batteries also seemed to die out fast. I wouldn t recommend this camera. 
16876 4 This ring fits well with both sets of threads, no issues whatsoever with this stepping ring. 
16877 4 I love it. .... 😆 
16878 4 Exceptional quality for the price. Easy (and fast) to assemble to put to good use in the studio. 
16879 2 Wish I could see more! its probably just me--- over all easy assembly. 
16880 4 SMALL, COMPACT, AND PORTABLE.... I like it because its nots a big bag and I can just swing it over the shoulders. Has a enough space for small compact camera, charger, cables, batteries, memory cards and several micro fiber cloths. 
16881 4 Works great for my SJ4000 camera. 
16882 3 I got this mainly because I needed a clear filter to protect lens, and this was red on the outside, thought the matching red caps would be cool as well. Cap is cheap, falls off pretty easily with a little bump, but the filter is still nice. 
16883 3 Great filter for the price !! 
16884 4 Amazing 
16885 0 Horrible. Yea it mounts up nice, but once you get driving along, it creaks and rattles so badly I had to take it down. The mounting threads are weak too and will strip if you tighten too tight. I threw mine out. 
16886 4 So far they seem to be very reliable. I ve used them on a couple of jobs and they have worked flawlessly. Time will tell if these were a good investment. 
16887 2 Was missing the leather &#34;guard&#34; that would keep the attachment ring from scratching the camera - I found something else 
16888 4 High quality. 
16889 2 Incredible product, seems to be new, but some screens have problems with resolution, but not much to worry about. Some adaptors also don t match 
16890 3 The batter did arrive promptly and did charge. Assuming it holds it s charge, I ll change to 5 stars. Great price, fast service. 
16891 4 fantastic product! 
16892 3 I miss the viewfinder and you can t take pictures while are filming. In all other features, the camera is great. Wifi is nice, you can take selfi with your camera and send to Internet easily. 
16893 4 It is really easy to install and quick to understand. The video quality is not the best, but you can see everything clearly. I don t know why their are the negative reviews, maybe they are not tech savvy. 
16894 0 Can we say generic?? 
16895 4 Great camera. Does everything they said it would do. 
16896 4 These Marumi filters have gotten good reviews, and I have no complaints. They are well-made and work well. 
16897 3 Good camera. Nice resolution. However, occasionally loses connection to my D-Link AC1750 wireless router which is very close by. A pain to repower when power cord is not within easy reach outside. 
16898 4 It does exactly what it was made to do. The auto adapter cable is a nice bonus. 
16899 4 present for grandaughter, loves it 
16900 4 product as advertised, very good 
16901 4 Fantastic camera. Cannot believe all that it can do. Easy to set-up and use Beside all that the pictures a fantastic 
16902 4 Love it. 
16903 4 Awesome deal 
16904 2 Thanks 
16905 3 Does what its intended to do and fits the instax 7s perfectly, with room to store film 
16906 0 Pretty but so complicate to find how it works, I just want to return it because I try record so many time and this one do not work. The instructions are vague. I still trying to figure out how it works. Never record anything 
16907 4 exactly like the original 
16908 3 I got this item on a discounted price. I found it really helpful for my presentations and projections. I use this to hold my iphone and project it to the screen just like any projector. 
16909 4 Clever design and very sturdy. Easy to add to your bag without weighing you down. 
16910 4 OEM replacement for the Panasonic LX7 and Leica D Lux 6. These cameras are identical, and the batteries are as well/ 
16911 4 Very solid with great optical quality 
16912 3 This is a great item just as good as rocket fish with the clarity but much cheaper. 
16913 4 Love this strap. Would buy again if I had more cameras 
16914 4 so fun! 
16915 4 Used them for our wedding and worked out Great!! 
16916 4 Does the job. Effective on my Rokinon Lenses. Would buy again. 
16917 4 Its good 
16918 4 Very good quality, easy to set up, and easy to use. All good stuff here. No complaints. Have been using for about a month now and no issues to report. 
16919 4 Nice Product works as expected ! 
16920 4 Charges great. Nice replacement. 
16921 4 I have been using this for a while now on boats, on bikes, and underwater. It has worked wonerfully and the quality is great. 
16922 4 Nice addition. 
16923 4 Leaps and bounds better than built in D5200 microphone. It looks great too! Fantastic buy for the price I have some tests on my youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqrVuiG7FXg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rpSp02sbOU Both of these videos were filmed with the mic!! 
16924 4 I needed a new battery for my Nikon D100. This battery works great. Good price, fast service. 
16925 4 saved me a lot of time and headache!!!!!! worked great! 
16926 4 Good replacement at a good price. 
16927 3 Very tight fit. You have to be careful when squeezing the camera in without any lens attached. It will cover the base quite well from any scratches. 
16928 4 it s nice 
16929 4 Worked as intended, kept water out :) 
16930 4 They do the job. Great price. 
16931 0 really can not see the details on the coins like I expected. 
16932 4 Best mirrorless camera I ever owned. In fact, I would put it up against my much more expensive DSLRs. Outstanding features second to none. Especially like the fast continuous shooting and focus. 
16933 4 This is a great product if you use in bright sunlight. Love it 
16934 3 It s a case...It does what it does well. But I love the design, wished there were more options though. The product showed up on time it was packaged professionally. 
16935 4 I appreciate how light and thin it is - easier to tuck in my AC bag 
16936 0 The batteries that came with the charger do not fit the charger. It was returned. 
16937 4 Best price I ve paid yet. So much cheaper then instores 
16938 4 exactly as expected and arrived super quick! 
16939 2 Ok for the price 
16940 3 Its a little smaller than I expected but I love the bag. The many outside pockets make up for the small interior. 
16941 4 A bit pricey, but I used during vacation in Mexico during the summer with success. Going from AC to outside and including snorkeling with 20 dives. No fog at all. It was worth the price to come back with good quality video. 
16942 3 Nice looking camera case. Very protective. Its a little awkward to flip open and let front drop ... I have to hold it out of the way. Still Its a nice case with a placed to screw my monipod. 
16943 3 Love this bag. Great for photographers who don t always have somewhere to sit the bag down to get something out of it. One of the waist bet straps came out of the adjuster, but it was an easy fix. 
16944 4 I have a Nikon coolpix P600 and these are a great fit with quick shipping. I am so happy with these lenses. I have been out everyday since i received them, trying them out. Cant wait until i actually set these up with a tripod. 
16945 3 Quick, easy, cheap green screen. You ll have to iron it out before use (just a note). 
16946 4 Works well even up to 90/100 feet and is very well made. 
16947 1 So far the camera seems fine, all early shots are great. However the additional items in the package were either rather pointless (ear buds to clean the lens!), or useless, such as the camera case which was too small for the camera, and the strap which did not fit. 
16948 4 These are a fantastic value, and I have had no issues charging them, putting them in the GoPro, or removing them from the camera. The charger also charges the standard GoPro battery, which is great. I ll definitely be buying more of these. 
16949 3 Fits what I need wish there were more pockets to store the extras. 
16950 4 Best Camera bag ever! 
16951 3 Very usable,perfect match for the camera 
16952 4 great camera 
16953 0 So much for easy installation! More than 3 weeks later still can t figure out how to install them and have to hire someone to do it :-( 
16954 3 Working well. Easy installation. This is the 3rd camera I bought 
16955 4 Works as expected! 
16956 4 This worked perfectly for cleaning my mirrorless camera sensor. All of the tools I needed in one kit. 
16957 4 amazing pictures 
16958 4 Mine came with a baffle. I put it together in five minutes. Brilliant product for my needs. 
16959 4 Easy to install and remove. Effectively blocks most glare and locks securely on lens. 
16960 4 Great!!!! 
16961 3 Works perfect on Nikon and off camera in S-mode. Bonus that it can be triggered by another flash going off. Build quality good. Only negative is that it over exposes slightly when used on camera in iTTL, though it is easily fixed by compensating. A real bargain at the price. 
16962 4 I really liked this Camera Case. 
16963 1 this is not what I thought it was. I didn t send it back because it cost more to ship it back than to purchase it. 
16964 1 Not delivered as advertised advertising five separate screens received one screen and a case that have different colors on it but not individual screen. this eliminates the ability I m doing a photoshoot with two different screens at one time 
16965 0 Very good 
16966 3 Works ok not consistent with exposure 
16967 4 okey 
16968 4 This is the best security camera i would have ,very easy to connect and is stil working well.I have no regret of buying it. 
16969 4 Very good 
16970 4 Work perfect very satisfied with it 
16971 0 This is only for the camera and strap. There is no lense, no flash, no bag. I was informed after my order was made that this is not what will really be sent. 
16972 4 It is exactly what I needed. It installed easily and feel secure. As for eForceCity they stood behind their product. The first shipment never reached me, they resent the item and I received it as promised. 
16973 4 Great 
16974 0 Synergy Digital substituted an EXPIRED OFF BRAND battery for the listed Synergy battery listed with no resolution. Beware ...you might not get what you purchased! 
16975 3 Great camera. Did an install for a salon & it works great. Very good picture quality too. Recommended. 
16976 4 This is the best floating handle on the market. I use it for my Bahamas trip and it work as intended on the pool and ocean snorkeling. 
16977 4 good float. 
16978 4 After struggling with the original finderscope and many replacements of same with no success, I finally bought this one and was able to align immediately. 
16979 4 Five star 
16980 0 the battery died after only taking 37 pictures. I was at a batchlorette party and missed all the good picture. Very sad. 
16981 4 If you need glasses at all, even just specs, this is a great tool 
16982 3 A little more skinny & spindley than I had hoped... But if you don t put a lot of weight on it or bump it during slow exposure, it should be fine. 
16983 3 Works great, functional, and at a good price. 
16984 4 This is a great solution to the lens cap issue. 
16985 4 Works just as good as the OEM batteries. No camera errors. 
16986 3 Sheds bad... Even after washing.. But photographs beautifully!! I might try combing it out.. 
16987 4 great batteries 
16988 4 Good Product for Such an Economical Price. 
16989 3 Excellent product quality, arrived on time and well packaged. Would definitely recommend if you want to design your own case layout 
16990 2 I bought these batteries to replace the ones that came with our dog s bark collar. They work but don t seem to work as long as other alkaline batteries. 
16991 4 I used it with my Kowa spotting scope at the shooting range. Worked great. Used it to photograph the northern likes with my Canon 70D. Worked great! I used for bird watching. Got great eagle shots. Very steady and versatile. 
16992 4 I loved it. I think this is awesome for the price. 
16993 4 Works awesome as advertised 
16994 4 Bought this for my husband for his Celestron NexStar 6E telescope. The scope, arm and base fit just fine on one side with pouches for accessories on the other side. This is a nice case. Spend the extra money on it. 
16995 4 Great VND filter! Works wonders on the BMCC, since it doesn t have an IR filtration itself. Highly recommend it. I haven t seen any video degradation in my footage while using this filter. In fact, my favorite footage that I ve ever shot using this filter. 
16996 4 Much better quality than a $60 tripod I purchased from Best Buy. I am very pleased with the quality of this product. 
16997 0 I ordered this for my Nikon D40 and the lens caps don t fit on the lens at all and the adapter is way to small to even fit on my camera. this was such a waste of money 
16998 4 Good Communication, very nice product, Item as described A+++ Seller 
16999 4 This is an awesome product. I can email photos to it. No more cables from the computer to the frame required. 
17000 3 Great deal! 
17001 4 Cable gives me super clear audio through my gopro hero 3+ black. It gives both engine audio and radio audio. Postage was also very fast to the UK. Very easy to use. 
17002 4 great bag, very sturdy/comfortable 
17003 0 It worked for a couple days. Now wont turn on. Battery is ok. 
17004 2 Item came without the cord that hooks the camera to a computer. Please send ASAP. Thank you! 
17005 4 This kit had most everything I needed to get me started with my GoPro fast shipping as always and packed perfectly.Great price!! 
17006 4 This goes in my husbands nikon and he is very happy with it. 
17007 4 Awesome! 
17008 4 Does exactly what it s supposed to. 
17009 3 Pretty good, but I ended up with a Tamron 18-270 VC which in my opinion offers slightly better image quality and obviously a killer range. 
17010 0 I d give it 5 stars except for the directions which are unintelligible. Very poor translation. Equipment works great so far. Revised 7/1/16. I m now giving this one star because it failed after less than one year. 
17011 4 I have been testing the cameras, now can suggest that aly004 with onvif technology is faster than p2p camera, the wifi setup is easier configure with lan cable using the software or the app, for now setup throught browser its not avaible. the camera works perfect 
17012 4 It s amazing ! My wife loved it. 
17013 2 Bought these for a Christmas gift, they re okay. Sturdy enough for the price, but even with all four set up, it s hard to get natural tones and eliminate shadows.. 
17014 4 Everything as advertised. Good quality. Good customer follow up. Highly recommended. 
17015 2 It does the job. Its a bit too fragile for my liking. Then again, the price is unbeatable. Had i known though, i would have bought a better, sturdier tripod. 
17016 4 Great kit! 
17017 4 Excellent filters they work great ! take photos during the worst high sub hours without washout. 
17018 4 best deal out there, great camera have used underwater with great results 
17019 3 Cute....no selfie mirror though 
17020 3 Great product very reliable, do not buy the wireless I have seen them fail in the field twice. 
17021 4 :) 
17022 0 Does not record video only audio, horrible item 
17023 3 Great DVR system. It would have gotten 5 stars if it had the hiddns ddns option. Excelente video quality and great mobile app. My customers are very pleased with this system. 
17024 4 Good battery for its price. 
17025 4 This stand works great! Much larger than I thought it was going to be! 
17026 4 Fits my nikon 17-55 perfectly! Great product from a very reputable brand/company! A must have! 
17027 3 Great addition to the Orion 4.5 StarBlast, fills the gap between the 6mm and the 15mm nicely. 
17028 4 Great product!! Would recommend to any Drone Pilot! 
17029 4 my nephew loves it 
17030 4 It s just what I needed. 
17031 4 Works as Advertised...love it... 
17032 4 Use on trips very nice. 
17033 4 Klarus!!! It doesn t get any better! A reliable tactical flashlight that allows single hand use! This should be the go to light for law enforcement! n 
17034 4 great did and still doing it job 
17035 1 good product, so far working very well 8/9/2015. update : night vision not working any more 9/25/2016 
17036 4 Makes shooting with the E-X1 a whole different experience. IMO, the camera should have been made with a better grip in the first place. 
17037 4 Came really quick, lens was great. Did a lot of research on this one and it s almost as good as the nikon counter part, the only difference is its a full stop darker sometimes, but can be adjusted through shutter or iso. Happy shooting! 
17038 4 This product worked great. We took it to Mexico and used it in the ocean, pool and while we were scuba diving. And it did float!! Super quality and worked great! 
17039 4 Great price and great quality. 
17040 4 Nice filters. 
17041 4 Great product! 
17042 4 Dog chewed up my old charger for my camcorder and this package came with everything I needed to start recording again at a great price. 
17043 4 Fairly light-weight, and holds the camera tightly. 
17044 4 My kid s love this looking at the pictures on the camera is not the best but when you upload them they are great and capture all the fun and smiles. I will be getting another for my other kid 
17045 3 Bought it for back-up when we travel 
17046 4 Very nice 
17047 3 Wonderful bag...needs wheels 
17048 4 It gives my baby power. Beautiful power and can t be angry with that......... 
17049 4 Works as expected. 
17050 2 A decent option for the SB-800 
17051 4 FAST shipping. Haven t been out to take some pictures with them, but I expect good results. 
17052 4 perfect perfect perfect 
17053 4 Great product 
17054 2 Bought it. Haven t had to use it. Can t say how good the response is to failure of the device. 
17055 3 8-in-1 for that price?! Hell yes. I use the selfie stick most out of everything. The chest one is pretty good. and so is the thing that like sticks on windows and surfaces haha. 
17056 4 Serviceable and attractive 
17057 4 It was great not flimsy at all for a low price! 
17058 4 Great buy! 
17059 4 The best of the best I use them for continuous lighting for cam shows and they are truly amazing!! 
17060 4 Great deal and they work perfectly. 
17061 4 Just wish I could open port 16 on my pc for full functionality. 
17062 3 god 
17063 4 Much crisper than the MKIII, a little slower but the sharpness is VERY noticeable. I shoot studio and landscape and a def worthwhile upgrade. I will hold onto my MKIII for now and sell when I used it for a month or so. 
17064 0 Nice build, light weight, but really to much trouble to use and adjust when I telescoping stick is so much more convenient 
17065 0 video quality is atrociously blurry, even when the subject is hardly moving. total waste of money 
17066 0 This is a great concept but an extremely cheap product. It s flimsy and the squeeker is tiny. I ll use a dollar store dog toy for the same effect. Not worth the price. Sending it back. 
17067 3 Seems to work real good as a dash can in car, you can also plug a power cord in it and run it all day long, also records over old video s. 
17068 4 The right battery for my Sp-100. Now I have two of them. I bought other batteries but they did not last. great battery. Steve 
17069 2 Heavy and not as much room as expected buy OK! 
17070 4 great price for oem battery. the Wasabi power batteries I have are much cheaper but perform at the same reduced rate, they do not hold charge nearly as long as the factory batteries. 
17071 0 The worst instruction ever. 
17072 4 It is the product I was looking for. Thanks! 
17073 4 Package arrived in perfect condition. 
17074 4 Works good 
17075 3 So far so good! But being my second one, you get what you pay for as well. Take careful care of the part that inserts into the camera when storing and you should get ample use out of it! 
17076 1 Missing parts 
17077 3 Very Good 
17078 2 It was what I wanted a little smaller than I thought but it is OK. 
17079 4 Perfect fit, focus to infinity ! 
17080 4 It works very well for me. I m satisfied in the video quality. Just need a noise reduction for the sound. If you put it in your motorcycle or bicycle and wind blows 30mph. You only hears loud wind and engine. But overall, it s ok. 
17081 4 Works great and easy to store away. In love with with gold one I recieved. Awesome kit if your looking for a selfie stick as well as a tripod. Very nice packaging also. Would make the perfect gift for any age 
17082 4 I love it This is just what I want. JUST PERFECT FOR MY LENS. 
17083 3 Great clear pictures. Using with a Night Owl Dvr system. 1000tvl picture much clearer especially at night. Have 4 and would order more. 
17084 4 Just as expected!!! I love it! 
17085 4 This charger works fast and efficiently. Much better than having to plug in the whole camera. 
17086 0 Does not fit the Canon Powershot SX530 HS as stated by the seller. I wish i had read the other reviews before buying. A total waste of money. 
17087 4 I love the product, as I am using it to inspect small mineral growth. It s perfect for my use as I can take still pictures or video if needed. 
17088 3 Just a question. Since you can put a UV filter on the camera with the lens adapter, can you leave it on when the camera is turned off? I get tired of taking the camera s lens cap on and off. 
17089 3 About what you d expect for the price. 
17090 4 delivered exactly as the image 
17091 4 awesome piece for lens protection THIS IS A MUST, fits tightly, does a perfect job and it looks good on my camera .. now on a side note i feel this is something that should come with the camera already like every other camera around 
17092 3 Great bracket. Great people to work with. The remoter trigger release I received with the bracket didn t fit my Nikon D7100. Had to return it. Got full refund plus my return shipping charge. 
17093 4 Great camera great video excellent point and shoot 
17094 4 Very sharp lens. I was impressed. 
17095 4 good 
17096 4 It is good. And arrive quickly, thanks 
17097 3 very good pic quality, and at wery low cost and fast delivery 
17098 4 Great product and prompt shipment! Thanks!! 
17099 4 I am very happy with my go pro camera very good value with all the asecssories 
17100 4 Great value. Love this camera! 
17101 4 Fantastic on the go tripod I use it all the time when I got out and can t bring my regular tripod 
17102 4 I love my camera. Very happy with the quick delivery. The seller was great. Thank you. 
17103 4 Like it a lot 
17104 4 ok 
17105 3 I love my camera. I suggest if you aren t familiar with this camera that you read up on its usage. The company did not adhere to the timeline set forth from them with sending the package. 
17106 3 i wish it came with big enough back drops, they are not big enough at all, everything else is 100% 
17107 3 Didn t fit the camera I got it for, but still found a way to make it work. 
17108 4 The color as same as photo👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 
17109 3 Works without a problem with my Sony minicam. The only reason not five stars is that the charger can hold only one battery at a time. I would have loved to be able to charge both at the same time. 
17110 4 These lights are great. I bought one for every closet, and one above front door keyhole. Everyone who walks in my front door asks me where I got it. 
17111 4 good product 
17112 4 Good quality and works as described. 
17113 4 Great quality, cleans well and can be washed and used many times over. 
17114 4 I ve never been able to take such amazing pictures before with any other camera. Best camera I ve ever had! 
17115 4 Excelent product 
17116 4 great buy for the money 
17117 4 Exactly as described, fit my Canon Rebel Xti like a glove. Very happy with the purchase 
17118 4 These sunglasses are outstanding they re great I haven t had any problems whatsoever I would just like to say thank you for such a great product at such a great price 
17119 2 Hard to put items in place 
17120 4 I absolutely love this camera and the bundle was much more than I anticipated. I had one small issue with one of the items in the bundle and Focus Camera replaced it almost immediately. 
17121 2 It does it s job. I find it is just a cheap feeling replacement. It often doesn t thread as nicely as the original Nikon HB-32 lens hood. The extra included microfiber is a nice addition, but doesn t make me feel any better about the lens hood. 
17122 3 Works very well, but very poor manual. We use it for an elderly person who is in hospice care. We get a good clear picture night or day from anywhere. If you leave your phone on all night to constantly monitor there is significant white noise from your phone. 
17123 4 Fit great... 
17124 4 Surprised! Very nice lens for a bargain price. I purchased it for my daughter s film class along with a used canon élan ii body and tested on a Rebel T4i with great results. 
17125 4 Works as intended, it s great. 
17126 4 Good 
17127 3 Works very well. I use this a lot and have had no issues with it. 
17128 4 Great technical support! Technician handled my request in an efficient, courteous, and professional manner. Camera works great both local and remote. 
17129 4 Works good havent had a ptoblem yet 
17130 0 Foscam seems to have stopped supporting their products. j 
17131 4 Awesome! 
17132 4 Works perfectly for my 50mm Nikon Lens. Thanks! 
17133 4 I bought this over 3 years ago and I love it still. If you still keep an old camera you know how easy it is to lose your charger. It comes in handy on trips or when you just need a little bit of juice. 
17134 4 Great work, and speedy delivery. 
17135 3 It was a birthday present for my son who has started a small photography business, and he is very pleased with the performance, while I was very pleased by the price. 
17136 4 was very happy with product, arrival was persise. 
17137 4 Awesome, best quad I have used. Having a memorial service for mine today. Taken out by a white SUV :( 
17138 4 Replaced a lost cable. It works well. 
17139 4 excellent product 
17140 4 Absolutely what I wanted!! 
17141 4 Great!! 
17142 4 Fits my camera perfect, really like having it protected and the extra space for more sd cards. 
17143 3 works as it is supposed to. 
17144 4 I used this camera to record the school musical. It was easy to use, light weight and produced a beautiful picture and sound. I do think it works best with a stand of some sort. My arm was tired holding it. I did get a stand. 
17145 4 Works great, fits well. 
17146 4 great! 
17147 4 Very handy. Each is individually packaged. 
17148 4 Paired with a couple Nikon flashes, no one would be able to look at the photo and say &#34;You didn t spend $500 on that flash you used.&#34; 
17149 4 Works great, suction is strong. I have used it mounting my GoPro to my Mustang when racing and it s never fallen off. Even mounted to the side of my car it stays on. 
17150 1 Low light performance is unacceptable. 
17151 4 Ok 
17152 4 will order from them again. was exactly as what was posted 
17153 4 A OK.... 
17154 4 Perfect camera 
17155 1 Camera seems to work fine, but is not a US version. From what I m reading this is a version from a different country and has no warranty here in the US...... 😯 
17156 0 Would not set up with windows 8.1 I returned it. I spent way too much time trying to set this up. Not a plug n play camera... 
17157 3 Works. Could be a little clearer 
17158 4 Go with camkix Unless you want it to say gopro on it 
17159 2 cheaper made than I thought but it was only like 10 or 11 bucks 
17160 4 Best selfie decision ever 
17161 4 This is not your same old peel stick sheild it is much better go on line see how they say to put it on take the time it is worth it and the sheild fits great 
17162 0 This camera is junk. You get what you pay for. Could not for the life of me get it to work correctly. Would not recognize my SD card and could not get it to connect to my computer. 
17163 3 Cheap and great quality. I lost my old one for my 2007 Canon Powershot. I was glad to find one here on Amazon. 
17164 4 This bag is a great bag, I knew it was a good choice the second i opened the package. it seems to be of solid construction. 
17165 4 I have only had this for a few days, but the batteries work (have to be charged when they arrive, no biggie), The charger seems to work. The package arrived on time and in good condition. The price was great. We have the cybershot WX9. 
17166 4 This is a very good camera case and i would highly recommend it. 
17167 4 cheap, holds long charge, good quality. 
17168 4 This is the only battery I use for my camera. It is a long lasting battery, holds it charge very well. I recommend this battery highly. 
17169 4 As advertised, was shipped and arrived in a timely manner. Would purchase again 
17170 0 Absolutely no customer support. Software is crap. 
17171 4 Battery works like a charm! delivery was very quick!!!! 
17172 2 Great product, however wasn t shipped on time. 
17173 4 Excellent camera!! 
17174 3 seems to work fine so far 
17175 4 Awesome if you have more than one battery. You always have one charged and ready to go 
17176 4 Outstanding product. Delivered quickly and the instructions are very simple. Now looking for soft case to store this product on my Tokina 16-28mm lens. 
17177 4 This selfie stick came just as pictured .Works great with my iPhone 5s syncs to Bluetooth feature .Perfect for traveling and being packed away as its compact size allows for easy storage ! Zoom feature is awesome .Takes great group pictures I recommend this product 
17178 4 Very sharp lens. Produces some really great images on the Nikon D810. 
17179 4 does all that is advertised so far... 
17180 3 Perfect for my 8ch DVR 
17181 4 Purchased for a friend, His D5200 was always draining the factory battery. I purchased this brand for My Canon & was so pleased, I got one for His Nikon. 
17182 0 Cheaply made. 
17183 0 I have only had this for four months and used it for three indoor shoots. The AC power cord stopped working in the middle of the third shoot. Very frustrating that I cannot return....this product stinks! $300 down the drain! 
17184 4 Got these lights very fast. Great price for such versatile lights. Came well packaged and the lights perform very well. The fact that these lights are portable and battery operated too is a plus! Helps out lots for outdoors shoots. Very satisfied customer 
17185 3 This camera has more than everything you will need. The tripod is a little weak, and the bag a little small... but the lens options and the wireless mic make this an ideal camera for quick filming and interview pieces. 
17186 0 smells horrible 
17187 3 Easy to install. I just put it on and it looks good so far. Decent price. Fast shipping. 
17188 4 Love the product. Made it so much easier having back-up batteries...and ones that last longer than my original one!! I highly recommend this valuable deal! 
17189 3 fits iPhone onto strap. 
17190 4 Great backdrop we used at our wedding! Quick shipping too! 
17191 4 Perfect and great price! Just what I needed. 
17192 4 Just received this item a few days ago and I am very pleased. It is exactly like the GoPro version, but for less than half the cost. It is very sturdy and easy to use. 
17193 2 Lens with good quality optics. However, the focus mechanism seems noisy & always try very hard with AF. Noisy barrel synonymous to poor quality control. May need to send back for either exchange or repair. 
17194 4 Love it 
17195 0 It did not fit my Canon G16 as stated it would, had to return it. 
17196 4 Works perfectly, just what I needed 
17197 4 Good strap! 
17198 4 Good package for a first timer with drones. 
17199 3 Its good. 
17200 4 Good product 
17201 0 No good bad quality even on HD wasted a lot of money on this pretty disappointed 
17202 4 my sister loves her camera takes excellent pictures and the picture quality is good 
17203 4 Performed as expected. Great for lithium batteries. 
17204 4 Its a great lens but very heavy. Pictures are sharp. 
17205 3 Only problem is screws are not stainless 
17206 4 Great value!!! So much fun to shoot with! Lots of useful tools came in the package. 
17207 3 I love my new Nikon. 
17208 3 all within expectation... 
17209 0 The camera does not take clear pictures. I can no longer return it and can t get a hold of the seller. 
17210 0 great price, lasted 5 months and will not hold a charge now 
17211 4 Wonderful! 
17212 4 Pure class. A Leica M6 with this strap slung around the neck and shoulder look as much like a major fashion statement as it is functional. Perfect. 
17213 4 Every piece of my New Nikon D7100 fits perfect in my new Backpack and it s comfy so far. Thank you 
17214 4 Works well 
17215 4 Great lens for the price. 
17216 3 Works. Bends. Stiff. Durable. 
17217 4 Nice Umbrella s. Work as expected. 
17218 2 Its nice and i thought it had a button and stuff but be careful what u buy 
17219 3 Works good but it s not too comfortable to use it. 
17220 0 Did NOT fit the Canon PowerShot G7X AT ALL. I wrote to them saying I wasn t going to bother with shipping it back. 
17221 4 Very solid and well constructed. Would buy again. 
17222 3 Good product. Would have given it 5 stars if it had a screw on ring to connect a carabineer. 
17223 4 good stuff 
17224 0 doesn t fit the lens. 
17225 4 Easy to get, cheaper by far than others I found 
17226 4 kenneth helped me greatly with my camera. I love foscam cameras. Customer service will talk you through and walk you through the issues you may have. 
17227 4 Great product 
17228 3 my husband loves the camera 
17229 2 Help protect my canon 70 D from rain. 
17230 4 I LOVE THIS CAMERA BAG. 
17231 1 Pretty good design, plenty of padding, but the top strap broke loose on the first use. 
17232 0 Poor quality, sound was spotty... Sometimes it worked sometimes it did not. Nest is better. 
17233 2 Just FYI ... With this camera or any camera you plan to use indoors for outdoor survalience, buy an inexpensive 55mm or smaller Polarized lens filter and figure out a way to gently attach it. This removes 90% of &#34;window glare&#34; from the equation. 
17234 4 Does the job. I carry this in the belt pouch with my filters so it always at hand. No problems with it. Great product at a great price. 
17235 4 Good 
17236 4 Durable and lightweight. Great product. 
17237 4 Great!! 
17238 4 Amazing. Does everything it claims to. 
17239 0 i got to alaska with my package and realized...NO charger was included and all the shops we went to did not have chargers...should have just bought in person 
17240 4 Works perfectly speedy shipping 
17241 4 Item was better than I thought! Extremely pleased! 
17242 1 This has been very difficult to hook up and view out side of the home. The software is typical import stuff that seems to have been quickly throw together. 
17243 4 Fits like OEM eyecup. Good deal! 
17244 4 Awesome and affordable.Recomend it for starters 
17245 4 Great quality and strength. I ve used this for multiple shoots through cities over the course of 15 hours. Holds up well, feels decent on back 
17246 4 10 points. everything was as expected 
17247 4 Took this white water rafting and stayed on my life vest the whole time. The clip is very tight, sometimes even a little difficult but perfect to secure a camera. 
17248 4 This is a great product! Affordable and fast shipping. I really only needed the dust blower to clean my camera. The extra accessories were bonus! Would recommend and would buy again from this seller. 
17249 4 Great remote trigger, the button has a slide lock for shooting bulb. Nothing to complain about. 
17250 3 Good carry-gopro-bag! 
17251 4 Product is fantastic. I highly recommend. A good value and works perfectly. Software is flawless. 
17252 4 excellent product, very satisfied with tripod. 
17253 4 Good 
17254 4 very good item delivered as expected. 
17255 4 A very clever and useful tool for dolly shots 
17256 4 attaches easily and securely. 
17257 4 Installation is simple and easy. Like others said, the sticky tape provided is not good and used 3M extreme mounting tape. All sensors are working with factory settings. No issue. 
17258 4 I got my order on time and it was.perfect 
17259 4 Takes great pictures 
17260 4 an inexpensive and super wide lens 
17261 4 Very happy with this purchase. 
17262 4 Good build and design. Tripod mount is metal under center of lens. No block on speaker and LCD monitor tilts downward and upwards. Good weight balance with XF23. Feels good in my hands better than Fuji hand grip MHG-XT10 especially with bigger lens like XF56. 
17263 4 It works perfectly. 
17264 4 Camera worked Great I love it so much. Shipping was only 10 days. I would definitely recommend this camera 
17265 4 Wife loves it. 
17266 2 Worked fine, but would sometimes stick when trying to extend, and was difficult to fix. 
17267 4 Exactly what i wanted to replace the one i broke. 
17268 4 Works as expected. Great to have the camera working again. 
17269 3 work great 
17270 4 Perfect just exactly the safety we were needing. 
17271 4 Bought for a 8 year old fishing nut and he loves it! Caught his biggest fish shortly after receiving this camera! 
17272 4 Lenses caps fit tightly, and the elastic band is strong. I have one of these on each of my lenses, as I do a lot of active shots. This is a great buy. 
17273 4 perfect 
17274 4 except for the labeling, battery is exactly the same as the one that came with the camera. Charged it up and away I went. Works great. Nice to have a spare so you don t have to be charging all the time. 
17275 1 Smaller and not as stretchy as the write-ups imply. 
17276 4 Everything was a presented. i thought the case was a little bigger but my wife says it s fine and she is the one using it.. 
17277 4 This grip works great and easy to use. Slides on without any problems. Does add some bulkyness to the camera. Did not break and was not defective. 
17278 4 Worked well on my dive trip. 
17279 4 This product was as advertised. Everything was present and the shipping was on time. Having only played around with most of the features of this kit, I would say that I m impressed with its quality and price. 
17280 4 great lens 
17281 4 LOVE IT! My lens arrived on time and came in perfect condition. The box was wrapped as if it was brand new. The Lens had no scratches on it. Definitely worth the price. 
17282 4 My 7-year old Cyber-shot camera died and I was glad I could replace it with one that was similar: pretty much the same features and operation, uses same card and battery, not too expensive. It will be way cool if I can squeeze 7 years out of this one. 
17283 4 this quadcopter is amazing! the camera is super clear and stable in flight. the controls are a cinch to handle. Its great in wind and will stay very stable using the gps. really, its incredible. Photos are super clear. 
17284 4 Love it! 
17285 3 Really good 
17286 4 Great service, quick ship. Product packaged really, really well. So far the product performs as I expected. No complaints! 
17287 4 Excellent polarizer. Build quality is good. Does an amazing job at removing reflections (see attached photos). One must be mindful of the exposure time however as it does darken the image some and the best way to compensate without having to use a tripod is to increase ISO. 
17288 4 Nothing fancy, but for the price you can t beat it. It fits my canon g7x. 
17289 1 This camera was working as advertised for 2-3 years, but this summer, I took it to the beach and water got into the camera (LCD screen area) even though the latch was locked. Now the camera doesn t work. 
17290 4 Fits my camera-plenty of room to add on devices. 
17291 4 The camera arrived on time. Took on vacation this summer. Takes very good pictures and the price was right. 
17292 0 Camera does not work and phone app does not recgnize camera. Two thumbs down!!! 
17293 4 Very good 
17294 4 My 15 yo daughter loves it! 
17295 4 Just what I wanted for a great price! 
17296 4 I use this frequently when I am taking landscapes. It weighs nothing, is simple to connect, and works flawlessly. Cable is just the right length. 
17297 3 Package deal with all the extras for your new camera 
17298 4 They hold sand like they re supposed to. 
17299 4 I am starting in DSLR cameras and the Nikon D3200 is perfect for beginners who wanto to grow at fast rate. 
17300 4 I use camera batteries as fast as I can charge them. These Vivitar batteries last as long as my Canon batteries & these are A Lot cheaper in cost! I use them in my Canon SX700 HS. Also fast shipping by seller. 
17301 0 was supposed to be color, but the prints come out almost sepia. would not buy again. 8 prints for over 20.00 should be good quality 
17302 4 absolutely SOLID !!!! my original broke while skiing, it ruins the day it is well worth the peace of mind. feels heavier but it isnt. 
17303 4 I was happy with my lens filter 
17304 4 great camera 
17305 4 Fits tight but not to tight 
17306 4 Works fine for what I needed it for. 
17307 4 Fits perfectly in the hot shoe on my A6000 
17308 0 Camera works great! Software is smooth. Easy to connect. Update: This camera sends all of your video to the &#34;Cloud&#34; located in China. If you are into privacy I suggest you try a camera that connects to your home WiFi network rather than directly to the Internet. 
17309 3 Fits well. Keeps things clean. 
17310 3 Nice camera for the price. Be aware that it comes in at 240, the 933 cameras come in at 480, so this is not quite as sharp. Does the job for what I need, tho I do wish I would have known this before I bought it. 
17311 4 Great device for controlling lights! Representative AR004627 was a great help on DLINK 
17312 4 Wonderful product. We use it on our binos. Great quality. Love the soft neck strap. 
17313 4 I m using this with a Fuji X-E1 - works great. 
17314 4 SUPER PRODUCTO 
17315 3 Works great, has a few quirks to get used to. 
17316 2 Gets the job done but the instructions are not very good! Tilt function did not work. 
17317 4 Great product have been using it for years. 
17318 0 Item shipped was not as described/pictured. 
17319 4 Still going strong, after all these years. Great quality and design. Very light weight too. Great for trips and special occasions. 
17320 4 Good 
17321 3 Works great, suitable for close recording in low light areas. 
17322 4 Thanks! 
17323 4 Great camera. PTZ and connects with wifi about 200 feet away. 
17324 4 These things really are magic. We use ours to remote mount cameras and flashes at weddings. The versatility of this arm is amazing... and worth every penny. 
17325 4 As described! Better than expected! 
17326 3 This battery replaces one that been in use for a couple of years... best recommendation I can give. 
17327 2 Good camera case but wish had more space to get extra SD cards etc 
17328 4 It works as expected! 
17329 4 Cap perfectly fits and has a very good quality, almost as good as original one, also it has a hole and a string to attach it to camera, its very helpful 
17330 3 This soft box is great for the price! It was easy to set up and does the job well. Getting it back in the pouch was a little hard but the same could be said about 99% of these things! 
17331 4 Item just as stated. Worked perfectly 
17332 4 So good The best color calibration tool 
17333 3 The battery is good so far. I will find out more when I take them to a long vacation next week. The battery can only be charge with the Nikon Coolpix W130 NOT W120. Don t know why? 
17334 4 My sister in law loves it and is easy to use if you are familiar with smart phones. 
17335 0 Neither of the batteries worked in my camera even though they were the correct type and model, 
17336 4 Sturdy step up ring, nothing fancy, does what it needs to do. Bundled cleaning cloth is a bonus. 
17337 4 Good price, solid metal construction. Fits on my A7S well and it is easy enough to take off. No light leaks that I can see. 
17338 3 Night vision sucks everything else a+ 
17339 3 I like it, it s small 
17340 4 Nifty 50 works great on my Canon Rebel T3i! 
17341 2 keeps popping off 
17342 4 Perfect fit work great! 
17343 3 Pretty good, for the price. Not the best quality mask or camera, but it has lasted a couple of years and it captured some good memories. 
17344 4 Great price for getting two backup batteries for my SX 510. 
17345 3 As far as the camera image quality is concerned, great, as well as the sound too. However, the lack of email alerts is a must have which this camera/software does not offer. The app you use with the cam is buggy at best at alerting you. 
17346 4 Super fun case 
17347 4 This contraption is perfect. Fits really snug and you can make any and all adjustments needed to get the perfect fit. My first time using this was for an alpine rollercoaster in Austria with no breaks. Solid and sturdy. Two thumbs up. 
17348 4 So far so good quality hardware. 
17349 4 Very cute album ! I thought it would be a little bigger but it s ok! 5 stars! 
17350 4 Bought a few times now. No problems at all. Everyone loves it at the party. 
17351 2 Good space, good side pockets, but........ shoulder belt side holders (hooks) are a disaster, totally broken with only a lifted. The dividers are poorly sewn, too much thread around 
17352 0 doesn t hold a charge as well as my other batteries, my camera shows the health as 2 of 3 bars when new. 
17353 4 Great heavy duty and heavy 
17354 4 Henry was excellent. He took over my computer remotely and fixed the issue within a few minutes. 
17355 4 Nice bag when you want something light and don t need a lot of protection. Great price. 
17356 4 A must to protect your camera. 
17357 4 love it 
17358 3 Excellent lens - A little bigger than the older I Had, a compact 20-50 ..which started with an 00 error and ended, a month later with a dead diaphragm, making all the photos totally dark. I m very satisfied with the Samsung NX 18 55mm 
17359 2 It s decent for the price. It does spin and after couples uses got a little sloppy. I Used it in the water mostly it hasn t rusted. 
17360 4 Excellent product and service 
17361 2 Good 
17362 4 Arrived right before my trip out of the country and it worked perfectly to charge my recorder! 
17363 4 Just what it s supposed to do. It connects an Olympus EM-10 to your computer. 
17364 3 Ok 
17365 3 Good functionality and fits the ARLO camera perfectly. It is a white/grayish color. Definitely different from the Netgear Arlo white. Although this doesn t bother me, it provides the angles I need so it s good! 
17366 4 Excellent 
17367 0 I did not received NIkon L28 20.1 MP the one I ask for. 
17368 4 This backdrop is pretty large, but it gets the job done wonderfully. 
17369 0 Very thin like a shower curtain liner, I was upset when I opened it up. 
17370 4 I would buy again with no hesitation 
17371 3 charger usb collapsed and broke ! purchase a separate charger! everything else very well 
17372 4 Easy to use for a beginner Sturdy stand nice lens 
17373 4 This is the perfect products for my camera! 
17374 4 This was for my father, and it is great. Simple, functional, unexpensive, compact, the menus could be easier to use but my 70 year old father learnt the basics and be happy with it. 
17375 4 Excellent for price for what it does 
17376 4 Fits perfectly 
17377 4 Exactly like factory cap, fits perfect. 
17378 4 This lens hood is nice, and works probably just about as well as the Canon one. The only problem that I have is reversing the hood. Other than that, it works well for pictures and video. It s a good buy. 
17379 3 Using this on an ASP-C sensor (A-6000) to great advantage as a 36-360 mm. Sharpest just beyond close focus. Great bokah at widest f stops. 
17380 4 Works like a charm. 
17381 4 Works great!!! 
17382 3 I have an older Nikon Coolpix point and shoot and its wobbly on this tripod. I got it for shooting videos outdoors so I can attach to a tree limb and it should be fine. The loose part is right at the junction of the 3 legs. 
17383 2 The product was good once hooked up, but the instructions and software did not work well. I had to program the cameras by using a direct IP interface. If you have some IT know how, you can get to work. 
17384 4 OK 
17385 4 great batteries 
17386 4 Very good camera great photos very good 4k video 
17387 4 Worked perfectly with a Canon 6D and a 24-105mm lens in a trip to Yosemite. 
17388 4 Fits perfect, Love it 
17389 3 Works just fine. Easy to connect to phone. Easy to use the companion app. Photo colors are alright but a tad off. Ink doesn t smear. 
17390 0 Died just after using for 2 nights. 
17391 4 Danny was so great! helped me for over an hour! 10000% HAPPY! GREAT CAMERA ALSO! 
17392 0 Nice looking but the snaps are low quality. First time I unsnapped the top piece the snap broke off. Replacement snaps are difficult to find. 
17393 4 Amazing quality and works great 
17394 0 It doesn t give any information it s very expensive and you don t know what your buying 
17395 4 Excellent product. I used the filters easily and the results were as expected. I recommend it 100%. 
17396 3 Magnets and snaps could be stronger - front flap frequently falls of when trying to use camera Nice styling. 
17397 4 Wow! What a great product at a great price! 
17398 4 Great, same as the name brand just way cheaper. 
17399 4 great 
17400 4 Excellent case. Highly durable and a good price. Fits all your gear for your go pro. The pocket on the inside is a great feature. Everything fits in the foam snugly and wont go anywhere or get damaged. A+ 
17401 4 Very good camera case. Basic, with some useful pockets well made. 
17402 3 changed out the battery for wife s Sony camera and it works as good as the original battery and didn t cost very much 
17403 4 awesome and seals 
17404 0 When i bougt it i think there is a cable for i phone 6, but it dose not 
17405 4 Great little camera. Has an external mic plug so we can plug it into the church sound system. Getting nice videos. 
17406 0 Waste of money, none of then worked 
17407 3 Great idea, Needs more solar panels...charges WAY to slow but it does work 
17408 4 Nice 
17409 0 When they say it fits the GoPro 1... they must mean a different one than what I have. Mine came with a case that isn t removable. I had to return the case and just replace the piece that came off. Bummer. 
17410 2 Liked the feel, weight and capabilities but went for the Samsung WB2200f instead 
17411 4 The knurling of the ring makes the rotation of the filter easy through the hole in the lens hood of my new Canon 100-400 zoom. Much easier to use. 
17412 2 Works ok will not transfer video. Make sure to put in airplane mode when transferring. 
17413 4 Works fantastically. Would definitely recommend 
17414 4 This little camera works great. Had some trouble with the wireless connection. But thanks to the excellent tec support this little camera is working fine. Thank you Mylene #AR004212 case# c6721279. Ask for her she s great. 
17415 4 Very fine 
17416 3 I like it and am enjoying it for the purpose I bought this for... I ll be back for more, it works amazingly well! 
17417 4 These are great. I lose these all the time so its nice that they come with 6 in a pack. They work well with or without a cleaner. Great for my iphone and ipad and they also are great on eye glasses. 
17418 4 This is my second Targus USB 2.0 Digital Card Reader and it works great. 
17419 4 Lasts longer than factory battery and multi use charger is handy for trips. 
17420 4 Henry performed a Remote Install for the FOSCAM F19816P camera I purchased. He performed the install without any problems got the install completed in less than 45 minutes. Very pleased with his service. Real pleased with the quality of pictures from the FOSCAM. 
17421 4 Easy to use and setup whether you use it internally or view from external networks. View on 3 iPhones, iPad and a computer. Haven t tried the SD Card features. 
17422 4 Extremely happy with my purchase. This camera is so easy to operate and takes beautiful photos. Already wanting to buy some better lenses! 
17423 3 a bit tight fit 
17424 4 Great kit for any phone to help with pics 
17425 3 Great buy for the money. 
17426 4 Thank you! 
17427 4 Most excellent range. Superb build. Prime focus points throughout. Travelling through India with this lens has been a pleasure. Few other lenses were needed. And it has been rained on, smashed against trains, auto rickshaws, and mass humanity. No problems but real fun. 
17428 4 So far, am quite happy with it. I have not used it much yet, still learning how to use it. 
17429 4 We bought these cameras for three rooms in our house and I love them!!! They work great and are at an amazing price!! We plan on buying more!!! 
17430 4 It s good 
17431 4 Great 
17432 4 I love this product. It allows me to know when someone comes down the driveway and extra security at night. I plan on getting another set and putting on the steps on the deck to protect the back of the house. 
17433 2 This Tripod gets the job done, but it is extremely flimsy. I thought it would ve been a little thicker to be able to hold my canon t5i comfortably. 
17434 4 This is just the ticket for all the extra things you need while videoing. The arm is very strong and as long as you keep the weight even it doesn t bob up and down and all around. Very useful to a videographer. 
17435 1 all 4 are exactly the same, all have the same product number 
17436 4 Great! 
17437 4 Very good walkaround lens. Beware it´s big and a bit on the heavy side but this is a step up from any kit lens. You won´t regret it. 
17438 3 Good fit for Nikon d3100 
17439 1 It is a real nice looking case, but it is too small. 
17440 3 it has alluminum legs, very stable even w/ a 4 lb binocular. 
17441 4 This is exactly what i need to work on my youtube videos with 
17442 4 Works well as a replacement for the Leica batteries that came with my camera. 
17443 4 I m not reviewing the product, the product didn t work out for me, not that its bad, it wasn t compatible. The service of the seller was excellent, resolved the issue well, stayed in contact throughout. thank you 
17444 1 No instructions at all. Still trying to figure it out for android and no way will it mount on the binoculars. 
17445 0 it broke literally 10 minutes after getting into the water and I lost my brand new camera! 
17446 1 We purchased this case to work with Nikon S9900, unfortunately it didn t fit well. It was extremely tight fit and we re afraid it might scratch the camera. We returned the case immediately. Positive side, it arrived quick. 
17447 4 Works as it should. I would have desired a power cord to plug in, but with 4 AA batteries and the LED system, it works just fine. The more solid diffusion rings are a bonus. Using with Sony A and 49 mm without issue. 
17448 4 Well built, provides extra space and cushion for SLR cameras, I m using this one with a canon EOS 60D with 18-135mm lenses. I m able to fit battery charger and extra memory easily. 
17449 4 As expected. Got to see Jupiter and Saturn with it in a clear night. It s pretty cool. 
17450 4 Sweet charger, not as fast as I expected. But it works great, and easy to charge, too! Fast shipment, packaged well, and a great price. Thanks! 
17451 4 excellent! 
17452 4 as advertised 
17453 4 nice camera for the price 
17454 3 I m still finding things to use. I just got done with an afternoon of wearing the head mount while I was climbing a tower [inside] and walking on campus. Worked great. 
17455 4 I m really satiafied with this great combo. 
17456 3 Great, but be careful not to over-tighten. 
17457 4 Excellent choice of lenses at a very good price and very nicely packaged for easy transport with my camera. 
17458 3 Light and cheap, fits perfectly, but to be honest the original ECG-1 is better - more grippy, slimmer base which is better for pinky finger and doesn t get so cold, so if you can get that one, I would recommend it more. 
17459 0 Very low quality. Short life. 
17460 2 Lots of missing items, the camera s fine though 
17461 4 This is a great buy. Also my neighbors think that I have a real security surveillance system. It a great but to deter Crime. The blinking solid red lights on the camera make is look realistic. 
17462 4 Great 
17463 0 The hook broke after couple of months. I never received any response to my email. 
17464 4 Awesome mount and fitting is perfect. Used it at the beach and caught awesome moments. Well worth it s price. 
17465 4 I definitely needed this! 
17466 3 Perfect. Just prepare for long wait, arrived 10 days past due, but it works good. 
17467 4 This is a wonderful lens 
17468 4 Good 
17469 4 Fits my Nikon D7100 and was very useful in shooting in rainy Alaska. 
17470 4 Good deal/product 
17471 4 This scope works exactly as I expected, using the Cheese app on the Fedora 22 version of Linux. A problem with the ON/OFF switch on the first unit I received was quickly resolved by an immediate vendor replacement. 
17472 4 Works great and charges my batteries quite fast. 
17473 4 I like it very well and work great in many positions and keeps secure. Thanks!! 
17474 2 I m criticizing myself...not the product. I should have noticed that I was buying BOTH a remote and a camera cleaning kit. The remote can be purchased by itself for around $20 elsewhere on Amazon. 
17475 4 Works well, no issues. Great price and does the job. 
17476 4 Probably one of my favorite GoPro accessories. I can easily get the footage I need when doing a run and its easily transportable. I personally think there is less shake vs the head and chest strap. 
17477 4 It is smaller than expect but the resolution on the screen is great. 
17478 4 Love them 
17479 4 Excellent 
17480 2 Kool look will fool you but the only thing it blanks, and a real cam don t. 
17481 3 Giving a 4 start only because it lacks the ability to collapse it to store in your camera bag... But for the price I wouldn t complain... 
17482 0 Item worked once and then stopped working. 
17483 4 Love it. 
17484 4 Everything we needed! 
17485 4 it works really great on iphone and android. I bought this one for a gift but i tried it first to be sure it works pretty well and my friend loves it! 
17486 4 My wife loves it! Still learning how to rock the shot but getting some amazing photos. 
17487 4 Works perfectly with camera and charger. So happy! 
17488 4 like the colored borders 
17489 4 For short footages is an ideal tool. Lightweight, strong and confortable make me gladder that I though 
17490 2 The joint and plates themselves seem to be pretty well made, but the shipment lacked the hardware necessary to connect the case to the plate. Be prepared to supply your own nuts. 
17491 0 This camera does not have a jack to support an external microphone. 
17492 2 clarity was less than expected 
17493 4 Love this paper. The color works very well for my children and maternity sessions. 
17494 4 Perfect for what I needed 
17495 4 People keep running into my wife and I ve looked for a decent little camera to use in the car. Then, some neighbor dogs attacked her while out walking ours, she needed something to clip on and take with her. This little baby does both pretty darn well. 
17496 4 fast shipping will do more business 
17497 3 I have just used this remote shutter at the fireworks show on Aug 22nd without problem. 
17498 4 Crystal clear focus without the Image Stabilizer! This is wonderful. The USM is required if you need quiet such as photographing wildlife. 
17499 4 a 
17500 3 great product great price works as description 
17501 0 Poor product had to send it back twice product was open already and used 
17502 2 the tripod assembly is a tad difficult when assembling the unit, but other than that a fine refractor. 
17503 4 Even though it s a little harder to carry this case with you everywhere it does hold alot if you are going out to take pictures. 
17504 4 Great product, and perfect little photos for keepsakes, would recommend to edit photos on your phone and increase the contrast and saturation since the pictures do fade a little bit when they print, but overall I m pleased with the products 
17505 4 Great price for a nice, basic camera case. Item holds up well. 
17506 4 Great kit! 
17507 4 Very happy with the picture provided. 
17508 3 works nice 
17509 3 Lightweight, and quick and easy to assemble. Material could be a bit sturdier, but as is, works well with paper or other lightweight backdrops. 
17510 3 Functional 
17511 4 Perfect for what we wanted. Works very well, easy to use. 
17512 4 Kenneth was a great help setting up my Foscam to send email when motion is detected. He is quick polite and knows his data. Thanks Kenneth, Jerald 
17513 4 Great product and fun for many events. Everyone loves it. 
17514 2 Camera does a decent job even in relatively low light. The housing clip got loose after only a couple of uses. 
17515 4 Great Items.. My customers are really happy... 
17516 4 Excelkente! Fits all accessories! 
17517 3 Good finish and packaging macro lens is also good 
17518 4 Very handy item,more when you forget the charger, and have one fully charged in your pocket. 
17519 4 Great camera for any small application especially for FPV embedded in racing quads. I have had a few cameras on various models. Also, comes with easy to use wiring harness for attaching to video transmitters such as FatShark/Immersion. 
17520 3 So far so good. SOMETIMES the individual items move around and that should t be. Otherwise no problems 
17521 3 good 
17522 4 Great! 
17523 4 Grate 
17524 2 great idea, not great implementation, doesnt slip on or fit easily onto the screen 
17525 4 So cute 
17526 4 Works great 
17527 4 works as planned, ideally matching the a6000. 
17528 4 Works good and in new condition. 
17529 4 Product is exactly what was advertised 
17530 4 This accessory fits perfectly for my camera! 
17531 4 As an owner of both a Gopro 3, and Gopro 4, this is a fantastic charger than can handle BOTH batteries, and can recharge from my computer s USB port. 
17532 4 Super filter for the money! 
17533 4 Is as advertised 
17534 4 Perfect - does what it says on the tin! Very sturdy and easy to fit 
17535 4 Works great, fantastic feal! 
17536 4 Works fine at a good price. 
17537 4 Delivery on time. Was due for new battery, old one about 5 yrs old and wasn t holding charge very well 
17538 4 Works well. I have only tested this and not actually put it to use. It should eliminate the camera shake when I press the shutter release button. 
17539 4 Does exactly as it s supposed to do. 
17540 4 I love it. 
17541 0 This camera is pure garbage. Until iIbought this camera I ve hadn t ever submitted a review or even a star rating. Now I wish there were an option for a —🌟rating. 
17542 4 Work just as good as my og canon battery and super cheap. 
17543 4 Takes nice pictures above and below water. Seems like the ones under water are nicer/clearer if the sun is directly above you. For the money you can t beat it. 
17544 4 these are propellers. I used them as such 
17545 4 Awesome 
17546 4 Great. 
17547 4 I m very pleased with our purchase. Camera works with our iOS devices flawlessly! We can monitor our little puppy from most everywhere. I would highly recommend this to family and friends! 
17548 4 Was attempting to take photos of the glorious mountains in our backyard. These lens did the job, though I had to edit with instagram afterwards. 
17549 3 Can t beat the price - bulbs burned out within 2 days - but very pleased with the quality. 
17550 4 I love this large air blaster. It works and works well. I always keep it with my camera and lenses as I use it before any shoot just to be sure that I get the desired impact from my equipment. Compact yet effective. Thanks. 
17551 3 Great when shooting all landscape stills or working with video cameras. Mounting to longer lenses causes some issues when going vertical but a work around is to have your vertical lens on you dominant hand. Good quality material. 
17552 4 we love it!!! 
17553 4 The camera was easy to setup. To access it on the computer remotely on another network was easy and picture quality was great. Even the app worked great on my phone for remotely viewing the camera and allowed for pan and tilt and speaker and mic usage. 
17554 4 Much better fit than the one that came with my lens. The branded original kept falling off and I ended up losing it. This cap is so secure I feel it is safe even though I removed the lanyard. 
17555 3 Works for basic monitoring Does have lots of features too. However many people have complained about interference with garage door transmit and I had same issue when i put it in my garage. So beware. 
17556 4 Super cute and easy to carry around everywhere with me! 
17557 3 Good size float 
17558 4 Love this light. Fit perfect on my canon rebel. Just what I needed 
17559 4 Had an XE1&2 This is a great camera. I do wish the flash could be manually tilted back to bounce the flash like my XE2. Also I love the drive dial! 
17560 3 works well. small enough to put in your pocket 
17561 2 Print very small, not really what I would like to have as a quick reference guide. Need magnifier to even begin to see what they are saying. 
17562 4 Another satisfied grandkid. Super easy to use and takes good pictures. 
17563 1 It doesn t stay on an active dog very well. 
17564 4 This thing has some zooming power, but you need to purchase a tripod to help hold and steady it. Looking forward to getting some moon shots; so I`ll let you know how they turn out. 
17565 4 Great 
17566 4 Excellent! We re very pleased! 
17567 4 great head, very heavy sturdy build as you d expect. just as good as other name brands but 30% cheaper :) so I have a couple of these now and happy with them 
17568 2 It doesn t actually detect my dog. 
17569 0 There is not enough space to tell one how I feel about this product or the company customer service! 
17570 4 good 
17571 4 This is what I needed. 
17572 4 fits good cant wait to try it out. 
17573 1 work hard to make this work 
17574 4 Works perfectly. 
17575 4 Great bag and perfect size! 
17576 4 My cousin is happy with it! He was searching it for a long time. So let s see, how long it s gonna last. 
17577 4 Need to learn all the begins the scenes fearless of this phone but love it! 
17578 4 As with all the other Pelican cases i ve used in the past, this is a top notch product. I use it to store a Nikon D5300, multiple lenses, a portable hard drive, a portable NAS controller, backup battery, nikon battery charger, and memory card case. 
17579 4 For those claiming the cap has poor fit, it took me a bit to figure out as well, but you need to TWIST it on so that it mounts properly after putting it on the barrel. It will snap into place and fits excellent afterward 
17580 4 Small, light weight and perfect for a 180mm or smaller quad. 
17581 4 Very nice quality. 
17582 4 Kept camera from sinking and came in very handy! 
17583 4 Works great. Do wish it had room for a second lens though. 
17584 4 playing with it all the time! 
17585 4 bought one more than a year ago, it has worked so well I got another. once charged, it lasts a long time, about five hours. extremely satisfied with the purchase and the second one was actually cheaper than the first one. 
17586 2 Does the job though the plastic is cheap and tends to chip off. 
17587 2 Difficult to focus 
17588 4 Fits perfectly on my camera screen and doesn t make it blurry to see photos. Very clear and easy to keep clean. 
17589 4 Nice 
17590 4 Fit perfect and strong 
17591 4 Great lens!! 
17592 4 Fast Shipping, product as described. 
17593 4 Quality product for a very reasonable price. 
17594 4 These cases are so amazing. Holds my sniper rifle and a couple pistols with out a problem. It takes a while to cut the foam but it is so worth it in the end. 
17595 4 having lots of fun with this 
17596 4 All the parts you need to make 4 lanyards. Pick your own length. Works great, and easy to make. Just need a hammer and lighter. 
17597 4 such a great, fun camera. I love the the pics it produces. Such a great camera to bring to a party and hand out the pics 
17598 4 Best deal for the amount of accessories in the box. 
17599 4 worked great. forgot my charger on a beach trip used my prime to have this delivered love amazon! 
17600 3 Ideal 
17601 4 Works great for us! Thanks!! 
17602 4 It is just right and came with in a few days of ordering. 
17603 2 Will this work with other lenses or just the 16-50mm? 
17604 0 Cheap and doesn t work right 
17605 2 its a very tricky camera if you are trying to setup wirelessly quality of this night vision camera is great and price is ok too but man its a headache to set it up, it should come with a Advil 
17606 4 Works good. 
17607 4 Best thing ever... 
17608 0 Very cheap quality! Bought 2 and one of my buttons were already broken! Also product heats up very fast so it is a potential fire hazard! Was looking forward to these but on to the next amazon find! 
17609 4 Thank you, it good quality. 
17610 4 Absolutely brilliant little piece of equipment! A must have for astrophotogtahy with an SCT. 
17611 0 I have had the speedlight for about 3 months and the mode button longer works. 
17612 0 Fraud. 
17613 4 Works as expected with no issues 
17614 4 Gave 5 stars because quality was good for price paid. Holds a6000 with no issues and will be perfect for traveling. Little flimsy but if you take care it will work fine and last. 
17615 4 Out of the aftermarket BP-511, these seem to work the best with Canon 50D. 
17616 4 Good price. Good quality. Fast shipping. 
17617 4 it s a good items. 
17618 4 Great product! Easy to transport, set up, and use. I love the lighting I achieve with it indoors and out. I definitely recommend either having an assistant to hold it if you are outdoors or bring sandbags as a 60&#34; umbrella will blow over in the slightest wind. 
17619 4 Great start up kit. 
17620 4 Works perfectly! Very happy with the product. Especially the price. 
17621 0 Don t wast your money - you ll never use it. Way harsh on the orange. 
17622 4 Excellent product , very satisfied with it s function. I recommend this item in a heartbeat. 
17623 4 Clear and crisp photos. Good price! 
17624 4 Great price. Works as promised. No issues at all. I mounted them both behind the 16-50 PZ - no issues! We had a little fun creating a lego dance scene (captured on a Sony a6000) 
17625 4 Got the quadcopter running and after a few dry runs got the hang of it and it runs very well.....I am very happy with it!!!!! 
17626 4 Perfect camera mount for car dash or windshield. Sturdy and strong, very reliable. 
17627 2 If you have 70 yr old eyes as I do you better get real good magnifying glass 
17628 0 These perform as good as if not better than the Canon battery that came with the camera, and at a fraction of the price. UPDATE: Batteries last 1.5 years and then completely died. Took to a camera expert - and said that neither batter was holding any power after charging. 
17629 1 I rarely use the camera and it stays in the camera bag most of the time, however, the jacket started to crack after several months. 
17630 4 Always an excellent product. 
17631 3 This was super easy to set up - the hardest part was finding the button on the camera. Once that was set up, the remote worked instantly. 
17632 4 Perfect!!! 
17633 0 Holes only 4.3mm not the 8mm advertised. I had to return it, would not fit photoflex box rods. 
17634 0 Ok ordere the camera nad htis drop magic together, camera was dropped by amazon 
17635 2 Not too smooth moving it whilr shooting 
17636 3 Extremely sturdy. Love pistol grip 
17637 4 I recently purchased this kit and I am very impressed with the quality of the product! The images are wonderful and the kit is very easy to set up. It is definitely worth the money! 
17638 4 works well. 
17639 4 Great inexpensive, alternative to baby monitors! Great for the price!! 
17640 0 not good Quality.. take too long to arrived 
17641 4 If you need a reliable battery. These are the best out there. They constantly out perform my GoPro branded batteries. They last around an hour and 15 mins of filming and the price is great. Don t overlook these batteries. They are amazing. 
17642 4 Great case. The cube foam works great and gives you a very professional result. Very satisfied. 
17643 4 DEI products are my first choice for security and remote start 
17644 2 Kinda weak ,but ok for price 
17645 4 These batteries last forever. I snagged a spare and have yet to run my primary battery down. 
17646 3 I bought this for a gift for someone and they really like it. Does everything they want to do with a camera. Very good lens apparently. 
17647 4 Fast enough for my 810. 
17648 4 loved it 
17649 3 enjoying 
17650 3 works as needed for little dollars. Don t know how long it will last. 
17651 0 Spend 12 hours won t able to work stay away 
17652 3 does what it s supposed to. 
17653 4 Works perfect. 
17654 4 Perfect. 
17655 4 This product is awesome and works great! The video is very clear and clean, I suggest everybody that wants to spy and look cool get this product!!! Great product SpyCrushers!!! 
17656 4 lets me take picture of different objects without the burden of having difficulties in finding the stable position and exposure. glad to find this camera before our exposure trip in the slums of detroit. 
17657 1 Only half of my purchase works. Somehow one of my light fixtures and a bulb doesn t work. Sending it back. 
17658 4 Perfect, performs the same as the old one. 
17659 4 Works great. Easy to install and use. Great picture and sound quality. Love that there is an app for it. And send notification when any motion is detected. 
17660 2 Thought I was getting new prod this whole order was a disappointment 
17661 3 Battery life is comparable to the OEM battery, however it is a bit snug in my X-T1. It doesn t come out as easily as the OEM battery. I have to pick it out with my fingernails. 
17662 4 Works great. 
17663 4 camera came with 2 batteries and a charger.. but having another is NEVER a bad idea.. especially when this one comes with a car adaptor! charges actually FASTOR than the canon one!! product was delivered on time as well!! very pleased! stays in camera bag 
17664 4 A low cost alternative to Zacuto products, for certain things. 
17665 4 OK, the câmera is very goood!!! 
17666 4 Although i have too many lenses for this case it is perfect for my favorite two. I love the rain protector and how solid the straps feel. I totally trust this case with my most expensive equipment 
17667 2 its ok 
17668 3 Canberra does a good job for the price. Takes great pictures and once I know how to use it better I m sure video and picture quality will a go up. 
17669 3 It has met my expectations. Easy to install but with fact that this was for a new home build and wiring already in place. Very good mobile app that did the job when went out of town just after getting it installed. 
17670 4 I purchase it to extend my LAVIEW camera which works fantastic day and night view is great. 
17671 4 cool toy 
17672 4 I love this camera it has a stablizer which helps me take beautiful pictures!!! 
17673 4 so far works great! 
17674 4 Nice case! 
17675 4 Good camera, only use it a couple of days but it serves our needs very well. 
17676 1 I got missing parts 
17677 4 Very happy with my purchase 
17678 3 The effect in photography is as intended, however the plastic feels much less sturdy than I expected for the price. 
17679 2 does the job, but a little awkward. 
17680 3 Met my expextativas , good near vision 
17681 4 good lens kit from Goja. I am really loving the look of this and set 
17682 3 I got this to charge up and use for a back up on my camera. It appears to have charged well, I haven t had a chance to use it yet! 
17683 4 Great 
17684 4 Great Pics....Manual lenses are the best 
17685 2 Works fine but there is this problematic &#34;feature&#34; that turning it on/off 4x in 4 seconds makes it reset / forget the network. So far my kids have done this twice and it s really annoying. 
17686 4 Arrived as promised. 
17687 4 Great results every time with this film. 
17688 4 Love the metallic blue color! 
17689 4 Love this! Awesome purchase! 
17690 4 THE ONLY ONE THAT I FOUND CAN FIT AmazonBasics 52-Inch Carbon Fiber Travel Tripod.... 
17691 0 Would not work with computer - very dark photos - not easy to use. 
17692 4 strong holding mounts. need some extra mounts for the go pro. these hold up well, used some on the RZR running bumpy tarain and they have stayed mounted. 
17693 4 Great batteries at a fraction of the originals. 
17694 0 These things scratched the crap out of my 2 month old glasses lenses, even with glasses cleaner. Thanks. 
17695 0 Didn t work for long... don t waste money. 
17696 4 Good value. 
17697 4 Lightweight and exactly what I needed for all my gear. 
17698 4 never used a selfie stick before.... Very easy to set up, just charged it, held down the shutter button until it flashed, paired it with the phone, and started using it. It works great! Compatible with all the apps on my phone. The folding design makes it very compact. 
17699 4 Nice value 
17700 1 Pretty much didn t work for me. Too bulky, and i don t like letting my camera dangle by one side. I walk - a lot - when i shoot, and this just forced the camera to bang against me, no matter how i rigged it. 
17701 3 efficient & accurate 
17702 0 Crap 
17703 2 Not a solid yellow case as depicted in the photo. Otherwise a typical quality Pelican case. 
17704 4 Great Buy ! 
17705 4 It s not as heavy as a Pelican case so it s much easier on the back. The case seems exceptionally well designed. It fits the drone perfectly and the storage slots are well thought out. Everything fits perfectly. 
17706 3 Great product! 
17707 4 i have this product and I definitely recommend it. i can see my kids whenever wherever i want. totally worth the price 
17708 4 good 
17709 4 Excellent fit and was amazed that once installed my screen actually looked brighter and clearer. 
17710 0 Could not get it to work properly and couldn t get the lighting adjusted. I ve never had this much trouble with a digital camera. It wound up going in the trashcan. :-( 
17711 0 Broke the first time I used it on a motocross bike and lost my friend s GoPro that I borrowed for a shoot. Spent hours looking and had to buy her a new one. So this piece of junk actually cost $400. 
17712 4 Extremely good value. 
17713 3 didnt work for me but quality looks good 
17714 4 We love it! 
17715 4 Great camera, good price 
17716 4 Great product, highly recommended 
17717 3 Perfect pictures but SONY colors are nicer. 
17718 4 love it love it, pictures are very clear easy to carry around 
17719 4 Great bag for the price! 
17720 0 This kit is the worst. No instructions, just a mess of products most of which I have no idea how to connect or what they do. No instructions 
17721 4 Good!! 
17722 4 Work for the camera I purchased them for 
17723 4 A little pricy but worth it 
17724 4 nice bag 
17725 4 Works very well, easy to attach and take off, simple lil mirror accurately helps set up the shot 
17726 4 great deal 
17727 4 Just fine. Camera works now 
17728 4 All parts are quality, love the package! love the price! 
17729 4 Excellent 
17730 4 Original item, functions perfectly! 
17731 2 I have mix feelings about this. Thought about returning it but decided to keep it. The selfie stick is extremely short. Everything is just cheap quality but gets the job done. The case is probably the best thing about the kit. 
17732 2 not bad it is very usufull 
17733 3 Sometime it didn t adhere to camera... 
17734 4 Great light. It is plenty bright and can be dimmed. Also, like that it comes with a battery that can be used in your GoPro. Fits perfect to the camera. Would recommend. 
17735 4 I never want to take this lens off of my camera. It s so sharp and focuses faster than my Canon 50mm 1.4. The lens distortion is minimal. Love it. 
17736 4 very good 
17737 4 I am very impressed with this lens. It is very sharp and the Bokeh is out of this world. My portrait business just went up a notch. 
17738 4 These work great! I like the cell phone screen cleaner it works pretty good too! 
17739 4 Excellent 
17740 4 As advertised 
17741 4 working great,no problem 
17742 4 These batteries work just fine they power my digital canon camera just as they are supposed to do. 
17743 4 Great camera--so pleased with it. 
17744 4 A big help in keeping a full bag of gear on your shoulder. Highly recommend. 
17745 4 really surprising 
17746 4 Works awesome, camera see s this device as a Nikon product. Its built well and all functions work flawlessly 
17747 1 Great affordable product, but the software is quite glitch. You often need to close the software, shut down the FLIR device, turn it back on, and load the software back up. Or else it d be a 5 star. 
17748 4 Great easily charges batteries. highly recommend 
17749 4 Easy to adjust and use, good quality. Great for hiking, etc. Good solution when you need a quality product but don t want to pay a small fortune for an item that will only be used on an occasional basis. basis. 
17750 4 Quality is great, no complaints so far. I use them for wiring outdoor camera s and they have held up to direct, hot sunlight as well as rain and moisture without any deterioration. 
17751 4 Works great for going through hundreds of slides. Great sellers 
17752 3 Purchased a couple of these for kids going off to school. One of them was defective and the owner promptly replaced it (thank you!) They work as intended - pull the cord and it goes off. I just hope my kids never have a need to use it. 
17753 0 I have an 8&#34; Dobsonian Zhumell. I have used this time of camera eye piece previously. Could not get it to focus at all with this purchase. Tech support suggested that I move the main mirror. Back in the box for a refund. 
17754 4 very good product 
17755 4 Awesome camera. I bought this for my wife for her birthday. My oldest son played with it and ended up buying one for himself he liked it so much. 
17756 4 High quality A/V stick. Works well with Saumsung S5, Iphone 6 and Hero 4. I was able to use the stick with a Hero4 in air flight going around 100 mph and the device worked flawlessly. No turns or twists like the cheap sticks. 
17757 4 For the price, which was very reasonable, it is a great charger. Seems solidly built. Of course, I ve only used it once so far. I had a charger of similar size, brand X, which was pretty flimsy and stopped working after a while. 
17758 3 Very handy, and just the right size! 
17759 3 Is great and is the best mini camcorder ever 
17760 3 Easy to use, good quality. 
17761 4 Got these as a gag gift for my brother who is a photographer, but he actually loves them and uses them often. 
17762 0 Uh it ended up not working but I was sick of trying to figure out how to work with the files AND the camera itself. Bad product for me. 
17763 4 Everything was exactly as advertised and well packaged. My son loves the camera. Great value package!!! 
17764 3 works wonderfully my first photo backdrop stand would buy again would recommend to others 
17765 4 Great value and always handy to have extra power for my go pro on hand. 
17766 4 Works great. Planning to use it for remote live video of a baptism. Can t wait to see how it all turns out. 
17767 0 This was a gift. 
17768 4 good buy 
17769 3 It fit and work as described in the add. It is working great 
17770 4 Jonathan Reed from foscam tech support did a fantastic job helping set up my camera 
17771 4 looks cool 
17772 4 Great bag, for a great price! Fits both my camera bodies, lenses and flash. It s much easier to transport my equipment in a backpack. 
17773 3 Created a new quadcopter from an old quadcopter using this and some new blades. The frame is stuff and solid, odds are that it ll break the first time it falls out of the air (but we won t let that happen). 
17774 0 It doesn t Work 
17775 4 Wow fit perfect 
17776 4 excellent product. deliveried on time as was promised. 
17777 4 Great 
17778 4 This is perfect to keep my zip from just being banged around in my bag. 
17779 4 Works great! Awesome value for the money! Does exactly what I need for 1/4th the price! 
17780 3 Good quality for the price. 
17781 4 Great little camera...no problems so far!! 
17782 4 hard to find yet you had in stock at a low price. I am impressed 
17783 4 The charger works perfectly and the delivery was extremely fast. I highly recommend this product! 
17784 2 Not meant to be on a supervised system, no &#34;in / out&#34; leads. 
17785 4 i have LOVED using this instant camera. its fun & vintage! takes great shots. even my 3 year old loves using it. we display the photos on our fridge and in an instant film sized album. 
17786 2 The optics aren t great but I guess you get what you are willing to pay for. At this point I think I would have spent a little more to get one that will last longer and have better optics. 
17787 3 It is good. 
17788 4 I am sure it works well, but I couldn t use it. I thought I only broke the lens but turns out I completely destroyed the camera. Giving it 5 stars because I can t justify otherwise, but I did not actually use it. 
17789 4 The bag is very beautiful 
17790 4 The batteries are very good !!! The charger is very slow, but they give you the charger like a bonus !!! 
17791 3 Excelent 
17792 4 these are TOUGH 
17793 4 Kenneth at Foscam service did a great job walking me through the setup. The Foscam works perfect and looks great! I would recommend Foscam because of the ease and customer service. 
17794 4 Just what I needed to help in the digitizing of my slides ... saved time sorting what should/should not be saved. 
17795 4 Works perfectly!!! 
17796 4 Item shipped fast and was as described. 
17797 4 Works fine. 
17798 4 Henry did an excellent job of support. It is the first time the ipad has connected to my foscam camera. I also now know what to do to access from a remote location. THANK YOU HENRY. 
17799 4 Illuminati. 
17800 4 Works great! High quality! 
17801 4 Excellent 
17802 4 This was my first time placing a order with amazon, very pleased and will be ordering again soon. 
17803 0 Does not auto focus on a D3200. 
17804 4 Works extremely well. 
17805 4 Henry has been very helpful in setting up all my Foscam Cameras. Great tech support! 
17806 4 Lost my charger while on vacation , got this because it came with a battery for my camera as a bonus. Works well and haven t had any issues so far (2 months). Battery doesn t last as long as oem but it does have the smart info. 
17807 4 A set of standard cold cathode tubes with all required hardware to mount in a computer. I use these for interior lighting in my car as well. 
17808 4 Easy set up instructions! Took me 10minutes to set up and that was mostly due to the fact that I forgot my home wifi password. The quality in picture both day and night vision are very clear! I am so happy with this purchase! 
17809 4 I ve enjoyed these filters immensely. They ve been a huge help on my sunset and landscape photography. 
17810 4 Just what I needed 
17811 0 Battery only hold half the charge time as an actual Sony Battery. Good for emergency backup but no way would I use this as a first line battery. Very disappointed.... 
17812 4 Good service and product. 
17813 4 Nice set. Works great.. I d get it again. 
17814 4 Great package - great camera - service was very responsive. 
17815 0 Not my favirate a replaced this one with a much better that also holds my wifi remote. 
17816 4 works great for easy close up shots and much cheaper then buying a macro lens just for a few fun shots 
17817 4 Excellent, Love it 
17818 0 It never worked even once, and the company refused to suggest a repair. 
17819 4 This is my first drone and I must say am truly enjoying this. 
17820 3 Work good didn t have any problem 
17821 2 Okay product 
17822 4 Love it and easy to use which is a must for me! 
17823 4 Good buy and it s light and nice 
17824 2 All in all it s ok. The pin in oddly rounded and makes for an ill fit for a lot of lights. The tensioners are plastic. 
17825 4 Works beautifully for the EF-S lenses whose focus rotates the lense, ruling out the use of a petal hood. Best features are the accordion collapsibility for wider angles or storage. Being rubber it does prevent the end of the lens from some knocks against walls and such. 
17826 4 Good 
17827 3 Very pleased so far with the package. I really like the adjustable screen position. 
17828 4 Great product. 
17829 4 Really expensive to use, but totally worth it 
17830 1 I was under the impression that they would have sand inside of them. Needed them for a last minute fashion photo shoot, but since they weren t full, they were useless to me. The quality seems decent though, but since they come without sand I think they should be cheaper. 
17831 4 Just what I needed for my GE X600 
17832 4 This is a lovely camera i m learning how to use it,other than that it takes beautiful pictures. And oh delivery was so quick 
17833 4 Awesome lens. Gives a much larger view with minor distortion. 
17834 1 Caution: Does not fit iPhone6 Plus. I had to modify it. 
17835 4 absolutely love my Polaroid! easy to use and small enough to carry around! although the Polaroid can easily get scuff marks on. the best way to use the Polaroid is by watching a video on how to use so every picture will come out great! 
17836 4 Great product. Very sharp display. I increased the saturation and contrast slightly, but very pleased. Initially had a problem, but realized I had a corrupted file, and as soon as I fixed that, it worked great. 
17837 4 works great 
17838 4 Really nice construction. Quality product. 
17839 4 This unit is priceless. Nice and compact and does the job. 
17840 3 these cameras need SOMETHING for bright sun. This helps, but I d rather have a viewfinder. Don t like that it uses adhesive, but can t think of another way to do it. 
17841 4 Excellent.. Super easy to install!!! 
17842 4 A great charger 
17843 3 Very powerful despite its size. 
17844 4 Great deal 
17845 4 This is a great size to put my camera. I could put a Sony a6000, Sony Carl Zeiss 16-70mm lens, and have enough room for storage with a Goal Zero charging stick. 
17846 4 Thank 
17847 0 AVOID, especially from this seller. Mine won t turn on and the seller won t take it back. Thanks for the $300 paper weight! 
17848 2 it would be nicer if it had some sort of timing feature 
17849 4 Great! I love it! 
17850 4 Great so far - does what it s supposed to at a great price and I haven t noticed anything awry so far... 
17851 4 I cannot tell if cases were &#34;used&#34; as they said because they look brand new! Highly recommended! 
17852 4 AWESOME 
17853 4 Worked well 
17854 4 Works perfectly with no degradation of quality. 
17855 3 product as expected, delivered on time 
17856 4 works perfect. Great fit and finish. 
17857 4 Very nice and high quality 
17858 4 For the price nice piece of gear. 
17859 4 Great Flashes at a Great Price.. 
17860 0 dont buy this it s trush work fine at the start few days later less then 1 week it not working it s junk 
17861 4 I use this with my Microsoft LifeCam and it works great!! Definitely worth the money!! 
17862 0 two months after installation the hard-drive stop working, can t get help from Zmodo, email only support. I do not recommend this system, poor quality and no service. 
17863 4 nice chair, works great 
17864 4 A great tool to take your pic s very well made. Thanks very much 
17865 4 perfect. easy. durable. 
17866 4 Very good and faster 
17867 2 Was very disappointed because the Coolpix came with only a user s manual written in Arabic and couldn t find instructions or manual online. 
17868 0 DO NOT BUY. Hard to install. Tech support is a joke. Returned. Do not buy. It s a POS. 
17869 1 I have not figured out how to get it to work TTL. Must be me, however I used to be in the camera business. This flash/camera combo has me perplexed. 
17870 4 Received when promised. Good quality product. Will be buying more. 
17871 4 This lens has been wonderful at teaching me about depth of field. I m still learning of course!! I love the look of my youtube videos when using it and the look of my photos. The price was excellent for me as a beginner. 
17872 4 worked as advertised. Full charge within a short time...replaced original. 
17873 4 This lens is what I expected it to be..It s well made and offers a more graduated transfer from ND to UV that most others don t offer... 
17874 4 Perfect for small trail cameras. 
17875 4 Great system and service!!! 
17876 2 The cameras are good but they are not wireless.Thats why I gave 3 starzs!!!If they were wireless I would give camera system 5 starzs.The setup is very easy... 
17877 4 You can t go wrong with these cases. They ll last a lifetime. 
17878 4 The Mount works perfectly. Sticks like glue to the windshield. 
17879 4 It was a good purchase 
17880 3 So far, these batteries appear to last as long as the original. Most important, the Panasonic FZ1000, for which these batteries were ordered, absolutely consumes battery power so quickly, a couple of extra batteries from DOT-01 are necessary! 
17881 4 versatile, compact, easy to use, excellent picture quality. 
17882 4 Really handy accessory for the point & shoot cameras. This is my 5th or 6th one (I keep giving them to folks who have not seen one before). 
17883 4 sturdy! 
17884 3 Used the batteries on my sony action cam and it works great. So much better than buying at the store for a lot more. 
17885 0 Hard to connect. Wish I sent it back before it was to late. 
17886 4 Snapped right into place on my Nikon D90. Same as original eye cup. 
17887 4 Awesome, loads of fun to fly. 
17888 4 Perfect for one big lens and one small lens 
17889 4 It s really light, easy to fold and unfold, sturdy, and all: the seating area, the size when folded and the height of the stool are just perfect for my husband and me (weight 240 lb.) I will buy another. 
17890 0 Could not get a response back from the supplier. The motion sensing does not work well at all. I would not recommend this product if motion sensing is what you want. Also apparently there is no support from the supplier so I suggest finding a different supplier too. 
17891 4 I bought this lens primarily to shoot high school football, and it does a fantastic job! Built like a tank, operates very smoothly, and has great optics. You can t beat the Canon L glass! 
17892 3 Slider works well. The screws for the feet were sized incorrectly. I replaced with my own screws, works fine! 
17893 4 Great value, good lense for close up/portrait 
17894 0 WILL NEVER WORK NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. A REAL PIECE OF GARBAGE. 
17895 4 These batteries are a screaming deal. I have the two pack plus the original for my K-3. I am pretty sure that they last longer than the stock battery that came with my camera. Don t hesitate to purchase these for whatever camera system you use. 
17896 4 Great product, no issue at all. 
17897 4 Changed the way I shoot iphone footage. Takes a little bit to get the hang of it but the difference between with and without are staggering. Can t wait to try it with my GoPro.. 
17898 4 AAA 
17899 0 My glasses broke after the second day. The ear piece dosent work and broke inside of the glasses. What do I do about this? 
17900 4 Exactly as posted. Thanks! 
17901 4 Absolutely, it came complete with battery-charger and cable. It would have cost me close to $50.00 to get these items on line from Panasonic. 
17902 4 like the way this ride on the side of the body... a true neck saver! 
17903 4 this works GREAT! I was shocked that it cost so little! Wish I had it sooner! 
17904 4 One of the best low budget cameras. Super cool pictures and the display is really awesome. Only thing is the delay while taking the snap which I don t worry about. Excellent 5 start. 
17905 3 Flishing is fine but does not include any len cap 
17906 4 Got this for my daughter, she loves it. Works as it should, 50 count, and shipping was fast! 
17907 4 I use these for both the Nikon Remote and for spare SDCards ! I use 2 of these one in each camera strap ! Very useful little item ! 
17908 4 Easy to install. take me for less 5 minutes to completed. The camera look good with the blinking red light. I love it, it perfect. Hopefully nobody messup my front yard. 
17909 4 Works well. I use it on my bicycle. It grip well and it adjusts well. 
17910 4 All good, no issues 
17911 2 This item could stay connected it would be awesome. as soon as it says the download is starting it disconnects and the download is canceled. currently it just hangs on my camera strap but it dosen t work. 
17912 2 I didn t realized it had no hard drive so I cannot record. 
17913 4 These come in really handy, because sometimes your oe battery will run down and as soon as it does you just pop one of these in and continue recording. 
17914 4 Love my camera just what I expected 
17915 4 Great product! 
17916 4 Just right and beautiful. I bought these lens protector filters alongside my canon 24mm -105mm lens. The quality is unbelievable and well built. I truly recommend this product to anyone who wants to buy a good quality lens filter on a limited budget. 
17917 4 I love this thing. I can fit everything in there, except a mini tripod (gorillapod) and my larger RAM mount attachments/arms. Really nice to have everything in one package. 
17918 4 Ricahrd did a great job of helping me get this set up Great product and great price 
17919 3 Great product. Is working flawlessly. I only wish there was an option to turn off the in-mirror display. It is fine with it on, and doesn t really mess with your ability to use the mirror, just a personal preference. 
17920 4 It is everything that it said it was. Plenty of room for all of my daughters equiptment 
17921 4 great camera, great value 
17922 4 Fits the camera well. All buttons can be used while in the case. 
17923 4 Very good product 
17924 1 Does not work with the GoPro which i bought it for but it does work OK with my Nikon 
17925 4 great solver for battery = ) 
17926 4 Great 
17927 4 liked very much 
17928 3 As advertised. 
17929 4 Excellent quality /price ratio 
17930 4 Now he has a second battery and can keep shooting. 
17931 4 For the price this is really great. I needed it so I could get family portrait shots and I have used it a bunch of times successfully. It is WAY cheaper than other ones. 
17932 4 Incredibly solid and sturdy unit comparable to ones costing significantly more. Very good adjustment features. Holds an 80mm Kowa spotting scope at various heights and positions without a problem. A great buy at twice this price. 
17933 4 This is great way to use my camera now I can connect to my computer in the field without wires running everywhere. 
17934 2 I was expecting the body to made of metal like other cameras I have that were like it 
17935 4 Its the perfect accessory to protect your lense. A must if you own this camera. 
17936 0 Poor product. Easily comes off strap, does not hold cap well. I threw it away. No way to fix it except design a totally new product. 
17937 4 I got this for my granddaughter s 14th birthday and she just loves it. She told me it takes great pictures. I highly recommend this camera plus you can t beat the since it includes so much more than just the camera. 
17938 4 Bought extra cameras to synch in with a previous purchased unit. Works great! 
17939 3 Good product. Holds GoPro really good. 
17940 0 If you are looking for a floating handle...do not buy this as it definitely does not float!! 
17941 4 Works fine in our Olympus Pen PL-7. 
17942 2 These battery replacements were just ok, for me. I have found them to lose their charge more quickly than my 2 year old original Nikon battery. 
17943 2 Not the easiest to use but takes quality photos. 
17944 4 Excellent piece of kit, I was looking for a decent frame mount so the head strap was a bonus. 
17945 4 Great camera 
17946 1 Too much noise. 
17947 4 Great little kit for my Nikon D3100. Nice quality filters and accessories. I have purchased from this company before because they have good products. Super fast delivery too. 
17948 4 Perfect, exactly what I needed. The cover is cardboard with a thick plastic slip over it. The inside pockets do not stick to photos thank goodness!! 
17949 4 Great product 
17950 4 Whenever I purchase a camera the first thing I do is attach a clear filter for lens protection. B+W is the best out there on the market. Their quality control is stellar. 
17951 4 Great Product. works well. 
17952 0 I purchased two of them and they both ran *extremely* hot. Hot enough that you couldn t even touch it for more than a few seconds. 
17953 4 Perfect for GoPro. Same quality as name brand. 
17954 4 I Love them. 
17955 4 Product is exactly as the same as described, easy installation, good quality video pictures and a must-have for home security!!! 
17956 4 Good 
17957 4 Made in the Japan!!! This product came all the way from Japan and it is the perfect fit for my camera!!! 
17958 3 i like it ! 
17959 3 Worked as expected. Very fast charging 
17960 3 Installed it on my PVS-14, works great for the money 
17961 4 This Canon EF 28mm F/1.8 Wide Angle Lens has made such an improvement in my photography. Now I am getting more wide range images especially with mountain landscape shots. I am very pleased with the product. Canon is a favored product at my house. Highly recommend both! 
17962 0 While the image quality is excellent, the audio quality is really poor. 
17963 1 Only one battery was any good and tripod broke on first use. The other battery was swelled and would not fit in camera. Lenses work great though. 
17964 3 Can not claim to have a lot of experience withthe camera yet, but ran out of battery firt time using it...-yes it was fully charged, and yes you can buy extra battery capacity, but this should be standard. 
17965 4 Great unit for the GoPro - I attached it and forgot about it. 
17966 4 Happy with gift 
17967 4 Everything is OK. Good quality product as described in the announcement. Thank you! 
17968 4 Nice pack. A touch short for a D810 with an 80-40-- but its manageable. 
17969 4 It is such a cute and functional little bag. I just adore it! 
17970 0 I bought this for my daughter and it never worked. 
17971 4 Works in my camera just fine. Priced right! 
17972 4 Works great; It is delicate however. If you are a &#34;masher&#34;... well you know...buy a kodak 
17973 0 it is written on the box, IP Camera &#34;Internet Security Camera&#34; and it only works in the same network. That s a joke! 
17974 3 Lots of storage areas, hold camera and lenses tight and secure. Plenty of room for additional equipment. 
17975 4 These cables worked fine. Connectors matched. Video and power seems to both be good over the cable. 
17976 4 This is big enough to hold my camera and all my accessories safely. I love it. 
17977 4 Provides quick convenient protection against bumps, scrapes, condensation and dust when carrying a camera outdoors in cold windy situations or when my camera is thrown into a loose bag or back pak. 
17978 4 Woks very nicely to steady hi power binoculars. 
17979 4 Excellent product. Light and easy to carry and very useful 
17980 4 Arrived on time and as described 
17981 3 Fit and finish: good to excellent. Battery tray sometimes unclips from the charger, but appears to be quite robust. Gets a little warm for my liking, but not as warm as the supplied charger for my iPhone. Quite happy with the purchase. 
17982 4 Works better than described. Lights everything amazingly. 
17983 4 Good picture. Fairly easy to set up. 
17984 4 fits perfect works well 
17985 4 excellent, met my expectations! 
17986 4 The setup was some what of a pain to get online with my secured router. I have been using it for months now and it shows great reliability and app works great. Great purchase for the money! 
17987 2 It fits but falls easy when underwater 
17988 2 Nice camera add-on, but extremely difficult to remove from the camera once attached. 
17989 4 Looks like a photo on smooth material, pretty heavy duty. 
17990 4 great transaction. Product as described 
17991 4 Works great. 
17992 4 This camera is awesome! Takes the best pictures and it s simple to use. 
17993 4 perfect little lens. 
17994 3 It has solved my main purpose of connecting my lense with the desired body. Only due to it s inability to connect with the circuit of the body, many functions like Focus Point, AF etc are not working. But you can use it if you are expert in manual functions. 
17995 4 what I wanted 
17996 4 Great camera 
17997 4 What an amazing camera 
17998 4 works like it should 
17999 4 I love it! 
18000 4 Just what I was looking for. Much easier then the earlier versions. Definitely more cost effective since it came standard with the LCD display. 
18001 4 Superfast shipping. I love the camera. 
18002 3 Works great. Would not stay submerged on it s own and did not allow a drop of water into the case. 
18003 2 From the description I was expecting two. This isn t worth the price for only one. 
18004 4 excellent product. 
18005 4 Great lens. Awesome upgrade from the 18-55 Nikon lens. Very impressed with the colours and quality. 
18006 4 Great product 
18007 4 Good and fast shippinging 
18008 4 Works great.. 
18009 3 It s a good filter. I did have to clean it as there was some sort of film all over the lens when it arrived. Luckily it leaned up well. 
18010 4 It does what it has to do. So far it have endured cold weather and a lot of adventure. 
18011 0 Poor picture quality, slow 
18012 4 This floaty is awesome!! Make sure you do not use a selfie stick with it because it will sink, otherwise it worked great in the water! 
18013 4 Perfect fit for my Sony DSCHX90V/B! 
18014 4 Easy to hook up. Great quality picture. 
18015 4 Just as shown 
18016 4 very good. keeping the smudges out of my camera lens 
18017 3 It is great for the things I want to use it for thank you 
18018 3 great product 
18019 0 Terrible, Go Pro hit the water and the Velcro separated.........Go Pro is now at the bottom of the lake!! 
18020 4 Used this wakeboarding, hiking, snowboarding, and around the neighborhood. Great length, I really don t need more than the 40&#34; extension. Vey sturdy, no flex in the pole when it s fully extended. 
18021 2 No issues with the camera however it is not supported by Hikvision USA since it is not North American version. Called them for support on their NVR and they refused to help once they saw where the cameras were from.... 
18022 4 Excellent 
18023 4 great! 
18024 0 ONLY LAST CHARGE FOR 2 MONTHS JUNK. AND WILL NOT KEEP A CHARGE. I GOT A NEW BRAND 
18025 0 bad 
18026 0 not user friendly 
18027 4 Ended up not needing this order. But it was exactly what I would have needed. 
18028 2 I never knew i needed to measure light, but damn my photos have improved dramatically, post production time has been cut in half. Overall works well, but the build quality is a bit flimsy for the price. 
18029 0 Not worth spending money for this seller or product company. Its totally a garbage item lying in my house .And its of no use 
18030 3 The fit is fine. I have yet to use them, you will be bugged for a review every few days until you fill one out. 
18031 4 It fit on my Nikon J1 camera easily! It comes packaged in small transparent bag that easily opens without ripping. 
18032 4 Works well the the camera where some extension needed 
18033 3 Great items to have. 
18034 2 some reason it becomes hard to connect to other than thru android 
18035 0 Product failed after about 3 months of VERY LIGHT use not an electronically robust product. Unable to return to seller since it s past 30days After just a few shoots - it started to smoke. Faulty capacitors overheated and melted. A FIRE HAZZARD DO NOT BUY 
18036 4 I used for 3 years now and still going strong! 
18037 3 A set of 4 lenses that can be stacked to achieve some amazing macro results. The set is compact and carries easily in the case which is included. 
18038 4 Does exactly what it is supposed to. Highly recommended. 
18039 4 Excellent bag; roomy, sturdy enough to pack camera, lenses, and overnight gear. 
18040 3 Good quality, great price 
18041 4 this quad is my second best of 11 quads that I have 
18042 4 Great frame, very easy to use and setup 
18043 3 Arrive on time. In good condition. Working as should with camera. Very please. 
18044 4 lens hood was just as stated perfect fit no problems. 
18045 2 The mount that came with it was not the one pictured. It isn t the mount I wanted or was expecting. The mount that I received is for a bike not a shotgun. 
18046 4 good battery 
18047 4 Love this film! 
18048 4 These are amazing. Big capacity and long life. So worth the money and I highly recommend this item. 
18049 4 I use it all the time, no problems. 
18050 4 Outstanding battery and seller!!! 
18051 1 This is a little bit hard. 
18052 4 Added an extra one of these transceivers to my kit that came with the controller. It works great with Canon and Yongnuo flash units. No issues so far. 
18053 4 Love this drone! 
18054 4 Exactly what I needed. Exactly what was advertised. 
18055 0 One of the zipper-pulls on the main compartment of the bag snapped the first time I used it. The bag appeared to be functional and well-built apart from the zipper issue. It does have a nice rain cover and comfortable straps, but because of the zipper issue, I returned it. 
18056 0 The worst assembly instructions ever. They should try out one together using their instructions - not possible. The instructions are flat in wrong order and confusing. 
18057 4 Really good item 
18058 3 I feel like a professional. 
18059 0 Don t bother. Don t know what I expected for the money. Fish eye is exactly that everything looks barreled, the other lens combination does absolutely nothing. Very strange. Packaging was probably worth more than the lens. 
18060 4 Just wanted to say that this thing is awesome 
18061 4 These cameras are great. 
18062 4 THEY LAST SO LONG!! 
18063 4 High Quality and great price! 
18064 3 Tried it once received & it s very good. The packing is also very good. 
18065 4 This stand works great. I used it with a muslin backdrop for the first time yesterday. Although the poles were labeled with the wrong letters it was pretty easy to assemble. 
18066 0 Doesn t work with Sony Nex 5 LT as description said. Waste of money 
18067 4 Bought 2 of these. As long as your router can keep up, these cameras are awesome. Setup was so simple! 
18068 4 battery is good 
18069 4 Awesome !!!!!!! 
18070 3 Okay 
18071 2 it was ok 
18072 2 Case is awesome but I m missing the padding that was suppose to come with it 
18073 4 Works without a problem. 
18074 4 it works. 
18075 4 Very Nice 
18076 4 While these items are not the quality of OEM lens caps, they are very good quality and given the price the value is amazing. I am completely pleased with the product and would definitely buy again -- and definitely before buys an over-priced OEM product. Great job guys! 
18077 4 well-crafted 
18078 4 Pretty good 
18079 4 Nice size. Good quality. Easy to use. 
18080 4 Arrived super fast and fit perfectly. 
18081 4 Awesome lens... but you already know this. 
18082 3 clamps work wonderfully used to hold photo backdrop tight 
18083 4 Price vs quality and performance I haven t seen a better PoE camera 
18084 3 Nice product. very water proof. Does interfere with the auto focus a little 
18085 4 Lots of pieces for a good price. My only grievance is that there was no instructions. The pieces should have a least been labeled. 
18086 4 It s a good switch for automating on/off. Just make sure you have access to the RadioRA 2 software beforehand. 
18087 4 Don t know how I lived without it. 
18088 1 way too small for canon t2i 
18089 0 Awful. Won t fit in my T3i. 
18090 4 Great deal!!! 
18091 3 There were only the barest of instructions included with the camera. To learn how to operate it, you must download an 85 page instruction book. I find that very inconvenient. 
18092 3 it was OK 
18093 3 If summed up in one word, it is a short board camera. I the deepest impression of it is his top focus system, the menu focusing system option is only up to a lot of pages, for its predecessors, is definitely a big improvement corners. 
18094 4 Yup just buy it you won t regret it 
18095 2 Water gets stuck inside and takes forever to get it out. One more downside is the camera cannot be tilted 180° (upside down). 
18096 4 it s very good. the condition of the product is good. there is no scatch and no used. 
18097 4 Battery works just as my real canon battery! Love it and great charge. 
18098 4 love it 
18099 4 Works great......thanks 
18100 4 LOVE this. My camera charger access quit working and now I can recharge the batteries with NO trouble! Got a spare battery to keep on hand, too. Love my camera and didn t want to replace it. 
18101 4 Love these backdrops. Lot of fun to use. 
18102 4 It works perfectly, straps around my wrist comfortably was great for vacationing, water sports, stays on tight - drys out fast. Well made and makes the go pro easy to find in mucky waters of for any reason it ever fell off. Very happy I got this 
18103 4 great deal, we use the camera all the time, saves jacking around with a cell phone, pix are exceptional, camera easy to use. 
18104 3 Up close pictures are kind of fuzzy. 
18105 0 not work well. lost my gopro.a big loss. not good shopping exprience 
18106 4 Love this! Will use with the umbrella light kit for photo booth. Will order another one soon. 
18107 4 Brilliant little well stocked kit, I might recommend picking up the cleaning solution if only to save on another order. But i ve already made great use of the pieces in this kit. 
18108 4 Handy. Compact. My new traveling tripod! Thanks! 
18109 2 Works well as a relatively affordably little light modifying system but I definitely don t think it s up to commercial lighting standards. For me it just works well for impromptu events/gatherings. Good bonus is that it is portable. 
18110 4 No comments 
18111 4 VERY nice camera bag!!! 
18112 4 Our Studio is 100% manfrotto and these plates are a new addition that work so well! Wether you have the traditional 577 plate or the new &#34;long ones,&#34; this will integrate into your system perfectly. 
18113 3 Simple, rapido, buen servicio, y excelentes tutorias. simple, fast, good service, and excellent tutorials. 
18114 4 The batteries work well and the charger is a small size - good for travel. Just remember to push the battery to the right to remove it form the charger. 
18115 4 Better than the part it was bought to replace 
18116 4 I love it 
18117 4 Works fine as long as I have a 37mm lens on the camera. Which is the lens I use most. 
18118 4 Very good 
18119 2 Doesn t shoot well in low light, but you get what you pay for. 
18120 3 Good value for product bundle versus price. Batteries work well. 
18121 0 Does not work for the Sony A-6000 camera (doesn t physically insert into the Sony). Unfair to give it a low rating for that, since they don t claim it will, but the compatible list has several Sony cameras they I thought were similar. Dummy me. 
18122 0 I received this camera yesterday. I have not been able to set it up. The directions stink, the video gives the same info as the instruction book if not less. My Galaxy wont pick up the camera. Cant seem to find a phone number to call for assistance. Not happy. 
18123 4 These work so well and they are perfect. I am new to photography and these are much less than the Canon brand. 
18124 1 It s ok I was expecting the whole thing lit up 
18125 4 I love it. 
18126 4 I put this on a model rocket and the videos it has captured are great! 
18127 4 Comes with every accessory and has a great video quality, I use it mainly for offroading and shooting competitions and it works perfect, the belt clip accessory clips perfectly to the strap of a hat for a perfect first person point of view 
18128 3 works wee. 
18129 4 Just a cable - works fine.. No issues 
18130 4 Love the camera. This is my first deviation from the point and shoot. Great deal for the money. Everything is in excellent condition. 
18131 4 This was a gift for my daughter. It was shipped in a timely manner and at a great price. Everything was as described. She has loved it. 
18132 4 works fine with my Nikon Coolpix S01. 
18133 3 Genuine Canon LP-E6N Battery. I don t trust cheap third party batteries for my 5d Mark III camera. One star off because its Made In China.. 
18134 3 Excellent equipment for a great price! 
18135 3 This is the second one of these I purchased. It is very well made, and I love the bag, but geez, I wish it were a bit larger to carry all of the accessories todays cameras come with --- and the reason for the 4 star rating. 
18136 2 Very good 
18137 4 Excellent tripod. High quality. Shipped very fast. Highly recommended 
18138 4 Fast delivery, items as advertised 
18139 4 [[VIDEOID:58d2b7f2a34eb0053781a1de8164886d]]Great camera for the money. 
18140 4 Best extended battery than the gopro one. 
18141 4 Love this camera, nice image, really easy to use App, easy installation. 
18142 4 once installed works like a charm 
18143 3 A great case and does exactly what I need it to do. My only complaint is for the SD cards the slots are a bit loose and I have to be careful when opening it. 
18144 4 Fits perfectly. 
18145 2 It s more bulky than I thought it would be. It s really for full-size DSLR, so if you have Sony NEX lines, don t get this. 
18146 3 Fit camera nicely, A little snug which made it slightly difficult to release. 
18147 4 Works Great! Easy to assemble and disassemble, sturdy, and adjusts easily. Having the quick release is very handy, though I ve had tripods that are quicker, this one seems to stay still better. Overall worth it. Oh, and it come with a bag! 
18148 4 It worked out really well, I needed something to hold plans for an airplane I m building and it held every page in a well protected plastic sleeve with plenty of additional sheets for Engineering Changes, notes etc. would definitely recommend. 
18149 4 excellent 
18150 4 Needed a back up battery for my canon and so I order this. It came in a in the mail fast and works perfectly! 
18151 2 It helped. Bright reflections around water. I understand that is a big test. 
18152 4 Fit perfectly on my D800 and much clearer than the original. Recently opened my camera bag and found the protector damaged badly. Took it out and suprisantly found my camera screen still in tact, not a scratch. Buying another one to replace right now. Highly recommended. 
18153 4 Good value and works very well. 
18154 3 great product. GOPro works well with this 
18155 4 I use this with my Canon 1.8 50mm prime and it works great.. it s obviously not going to be as good a legit macro lens, however it s fantastic when you consider the abilities this $20 metal tube. Would recommend. 
18156 0 A TOTAL RIPOFF! Batteries will not haold a charge. Cannot get 10 pictures per charge. 
18157 4 A great little camera for the money. Bought it as refurbished, but looks and works like new. Canon makes a great camera. 
18158 4 It worked as advertised and the price was very good. 
18159 4 This works perfectly with my Phantom 2 that I have Fatshark goggles installed on. It is nice to have another monitor for other people to watch or sometimes it is just easier to fly without the FPV goggles. 
18160 4 Works great thks! 
18161 4 just what the Doctor ordered 
18162 4 A gift for my son, he says it is great... 
18163 1 Didn t have all the film !!! 
18164 4 good 
18165 4 Works well. 
18166 0 I received a tripod with a defective ball head (it won t stay in place). Over the course of months I tried to contact Manfrotto so it could be replaced, but got no answer whatsoever. Shame on Manfrotto. 
18167 4 My husband loves his watch but has tucked it away to use on special occasions which I find a bit strange, but I know he is really pleased with it. 
18168 4 I have not had the opportunity to use it to the full extent as of yet, because of my work schedule, but the little time that i have had to play with it I love the small economy size of the camera, and it came with every item as advertised. 
18169 4 This system works well for us as we travel a lot and can watch our home. 
18170 4 Great little quadcopter, perfect for learning. Do buy teh blade protectors for it. 
18171 4 Fast delivered, very nice! 
18172 3 Works Great 
18173 4 I am in love with this product. Works really great on my Nikon d3200. Absolutely recommend this product for others. 
18174 4 I didn t purchase this on amazon but through a local store but I have to say that it takes absolutely gorgeous photos. Really amazing and manually focusing with the A7 cameras is a breeze. Highly recommended. 
18175 4 So far Loving it 
18176 4 great 
18177 4 Works great! 
18178 4 Works great! 
18179 0 I m not happy with this product, is really bad, I d never recommend. 
18180 3 Great compact size camera, i have a canon 60D and it fits fine with a standard lens. 
18181 3 Love it, but the battery life is under 30 seconds. I think there is an issue and I m not sure who to contact. Could you contact us? 
18182 1 I received Different camera that I bough t and I Lost money 
18183 3 Very good 
18184 3 This has helped me from straining my voice from yelling across the house. It s my voice saver. :) 
18185 4 Worked great no issues 
18186 4 Works fine, no problems. 
18187 4 Super easy to put on my D3200. Looks GREAT, and makes the camera easier to grip/hold on to. I have had lots of complements on it. LOVE IT!!! 
18188 4 The motion notifications is amazing. I m able to cut pieces of videos I want and share it with my family. I truly recommend nest cam. I also have the thermostat and is awesome. 
18189 4 this paper is so fun, and now it s so cheap! 
18190 4 Very nice case with lots of adjustable compartments for an additional lens, extra batteries, etc. I would recommend this case to a friend. 
18191 4 Awesome! 
18192 4 Very impressed. Need to see the You Tube video for installation. Takes about 10 minutes to install. Watch the video. 
18193 4 Great insert if you have a bag large enough. 
18194 1 I felt like it was hard to good a good angle.. Complicated and failed when I needed it to work. 
18195 4 cool 
18196 4 Perfect for handgun storage. I own a dozen Pelican cases of different sizes for storing everything from handguns to a high end camera. Foam is pick snd pluck for a perfect fit. Sturdy, water and dust proof. Also TSA compliant for airline travel. 
18197 3 Worked like a champ did have problems with led but you can turn sensitivity down and back up light will go out. I m guessing the bad reviews were given by people using to fast a shutter or to slow a lens. 
18198 3 Good for priceG 
18199 4 Excellent quality photos and easy to use! We had a Canon similar to this for the last 8 years and it just now started using a lot of batteries. Love the zoom and other features! Great color too ;) Will always stick with Canon! 
18200 3 Great...Worked out very well for filming parent children interactions 
18201 4 Fits and works like the original, but at a lower cost. Great deal 
18202 4 Great protection for the camera. It has got a nice little side pouch to stuff in any extra cables, etc. There is also an extra side zipper where i stock extra batteries and sd cards. 
18203 4 Perfectly convenient and durable bag to carry my new camera in that has a nice shoulder strap making it easy and safe to carry. 
18204 4 Good price 
18205 3 Not bad 
18206 4 Definitely met our expectations! Very nice! 
18207 3 enjoying 
18208 4 This bag is perfect for my camera. Durable, quality construction. highly recommended. 
18209 4 A neat gadget for anyone with a smart phone that enjoys photography. It is nice to have a few more options to the iPhone s camera. 
18210 4 It works great with my new camera! 
18211 4 Perfect for my camera. 
18212 0 Couldn t ever figure out how to set up 
18213 4 Good 
18214 4 Charged up easily, held charge, and WORKS! 
18215 0 Quality of pictures was not good. Customer service explained that they might not be compatible with existing analog DVR. He gladly set up a return which I did do. 
18216 4 Great camera and kit for the price! 
18217 4 I bought this case for my husband for his GoPro for our anniversary and I am so glad that I did. It s extremely heavy duty and fits everything including accessories very well. 
18218 4 I love this little camera, so great to check on my property from 3000 miles away. The images are good enough to identify a person s face at a good distance. Totally worth the price. I got this as a gift. 
18219 4 These batteries work well and hold their charge. 
18220 3 Great set to have!!! 
18221 4 Good product. Good service. 
18222 4 Worked fine. 
18223 4 They work awesome, I will recomended this product to everybody. 
18224 4 nice quality 
18225 2 It works fine but the bucle is quite fragile, must close it with care:-) 
18226 4 good product prompt shipment 
18227 4 Works great. I even dropped it shortly after buying it and only a tiny piece chipped off. Wonderful product for the price and greatly extends battery life. I leave it on 24/7 and hardly ever worry about not having enough juice. 
18228 4 great does all the cameras with the one plugin 
18229 4 Lost the one that came with the camera. This worked like a charm and at a great price. 
18230 4 Very happy with this purchase. Prompt shipping and everything arrived as expected. 
18231 4 Came neatly packaged in its box with directions! :) 
18232 4 Works as intended with my vk750ii speedlight. I like that it uses AAA batteries vs hard to find batteries like the altura flash. Two step remote button for focus then capture is a great addition! 
18233 0 Returned this item. No directions as to how to put it together. Did not seem to be flexible enough to move and catch the light in a timely manner. I just use the reflectors by hand now. 
18234 4 Got the charger quickly, without a problem. Charged up our extra batteries and it works fine! 
18235 4 Great tripod for the the price. I am in no way a professional photagrapher but you can tell this is a high quality product. 
18236 4 Perfect little container with premade slots for my basic GoPro equipment. 
18237 4 Works great. The first time I have used a light meter, but in unusual lighting situations it has worked out very well. Why did I wait so long to get one of these? 
18238 4 This camera is amazing just what I was looking for. 
18239 4 fast delivery and good product, works great thanks 
18240 4 Works great. I bought the D3200 Nikon Book for Dummies which helped a lot with initial use. You need to take the time to learn all the features available. The perfect camera for my needs. 
18241 4 This selfie stick gets tons of use! A perfect holster for the Gopro Hero 4. 
18242 4 Very nice. Takes great photos. Just what I needed. Not a blurred photo since I got this camera. 
18243 2 Looks more powerful than it is. I might as well used a small pair of binoculars. It was a birthday gift so I don t want to be to critical... 
18244 4 what an excellent product .leave your premises with no worries and best of all no cables. 
18245 4 Good protection for the camera. Great Product. 
18246 4 I just started taking photos with my camera, and this has made a huge difference in the quality of my photos, especially outdoors. I highly recommend! 
18247 4 Good price. I will buy these again. Got them when they said I would 
18248 3 Great size if only 1 camera and couple lenses. 
18249 1 Not recommended for mounting accessories to your camera rig, since they seem to wobble even when torqued down tightly. 
18250 4 good battery 
18251 4 I have a few old Canon 40D cameras that were in need of new batteries. This package deal of 2 BP-511A batteries plus charger fit the bill perfectly and the price was very reasonable. Very happy with the purchase. 
18252 4 This tripod is very good, it is lightweight which makes traveling easy while being sturdy considering its weight. But most important of all the tripod has great stability and captures good videos for vlogging and pictures for memories. 
18253 4 Delivered on time. Great price. Works great. 
18254 4 Easy to use and the zoom power is great 
18255 4 Just what I needed to keep my Canon lenses and sensor clean, at a good price 
18256 3 Lens seemed to get a little foggy, but easily wipes off. 
18257 1 Not what I expected. 
18258 3 WiFi is weak and not friendly. Reverted to an Eye-Fi card. Good price. 
18259 4 This bag is perfect for travel and allows me the versatility of packing not only all my camera equipment and computer, but also other small things I need from my purse so that it is not necessary for me to carry a purse any longer. 
18260 4 This is great. It keeps me from backing in the garage too far. 
18261 4 A little bit of learning curve but truly great resolution and ease of use! 
18262 3 Good camera for the price. If you want to have a high quality camera for vacation, causal shooting and etc, this is perfect. But if you aim for more professional shooting, this is not enough 
18263 3 good sttuff 
18264 3 OK. What was sold was an older version.than current new. So far so good. Wish it had a a zoom! 
18265 4 batteries came charged and lasted a good amount of time 
18266 4 As Tina Turner says &#34;simply the best!&#34; 
18267 1 Loved the binoculars , but they were toast after dropping them ONE TIME. I baby all of my gear, but come on... You re outdoors and things happen. If your product is shoddy enough to break after one little drop, I ll look elsewhere. 
18268 4 Works great. 
18269 4 Love this bag!!! Very cute and roomy too! The material feels nice as well 
18270 4 Great price. 
18271 3 Good product, but NO MANUAL. Be careful. Frustrating to install but once it s done, it works very well. Until now, I don t know how to create multiple PIN and delete existing.. 
18272 0 Why can t you at least provide 1 hour of video history for free? I don t need or want 7 days of video. All I need to see what just happened a few minutes ago. 
18273 2 Good entry level mount system. Works great on road; but allows camera wobble when off road. I have since gone to a metal mount with a rigid clamp system. 
18274 1 While adjusting the angle gently, it broke. I super-glued it back together but now it s at an odd angle and looks fake. If it wasn t broken it would look okay for the price. 
18275 4 Fast delivery and pretty quick charge. Great product, as stated. Haven t used it besides charging cause I bought them to replace the one I lost due to really not using the camera. We will see how well they hold a charge this weekend in Disneyworld :-) 
18276 4 I lost my camera 
18277 3 Good product and transaction. 
18278 4 Excellent product, price and delivery 
18279 4 It s great 😍 
18280 4 Cheap, and work like a charm 
18281 4 Excellent product, fits and protect the camera (nikon 5200) and all my gear perfect 
18282 2 This camera has nice zoom range and video capability but the picture quality is only average. 
18283 0 it sucks 
18284 1 Hard to adjust and kind of looks stupid in your head. It works, but I immediately started looking for other methods. 
18285 4 It was perfect. After all it is just a lens cap. 
18286 4 Just what I was looking for to be able to attach a small microphone to the side for better voice clarity. Fits perfectly into the tripod as well. Good choice. 
18287 4 Works perfectly! 
18288 4 Excellent 
18289 4 IT S WHAT I SPECTED. GOOD! 
18290 0 Ended up returning this item as it did not correctly describe that it does not support continuous streaming. 
18291 4 Stand is worth the money. Stable & ridged. adjustments work and it folds up small. 
18292 2 Not the highest quality picture but gets the job done. Close up range is rather narrow. Looks like winter all year long. Everything green is white. 
18293 3 Great little camera. Has the features and then some. Easy to allow your creative side to come forward. 
18294 2 Great case except could use a little more room for batteries and charges so it could be a complete kit 
18295 4 Purchased this for a backup for a wedding. Works great. 
18296 4 I didn t expect it for a week and it came 2 days later. Awesome!!!! Love it. Keep up the good work!!! 
18297 0 Video is ok, set up is rather easy although not well explained, especially for iOS. However, both my Foscam monitors clicks very loudly throughout day and night, waking up my kids every single night. Both my monitors are now in the attic collecting dusts. 
18298 4 This is exactly what I needed for my camera. The product was on time and worked perfectly. I need a backup battery for my Nikon Prosumer camera and will by from this seller. 
18299 4 Still learning how to use it, so far it s been a great tool 
18300 4 Love this camera so far!! Am learning to shoot in manual mode to get even sharper images!!! Only wish it had a view finder!!!! 
18301 4 Great product!!!! Incredible at evening out light.... Great for on the go photographers. 
18302 4 All went well with the purchase 
18303 4 Took these as backups on several trips and they worked flawlessly. They seem to get a bit less charge than the oem Sony battery, but definitely worth it considering the price difference. Used in a Sony RX100 m2 camera. 
18304 4 Excellent fit for my 7D MKii Great! 
18305 0 The worst matte box ever !!! Don t waste your money and you time !!! 
18306 4 Works great - light is bright, and close up picture (macro lens) is great. 
18307 4 It took me a little patience to put the hood and lens cover on with the filter already on. I first thought it wouldn t fit and then just &#34;relaxed&#34; and tried again! I like having the different filters and the case as well. 
18308 4 Works as expected, very sturdy and doesn t slide around, attaches well to the camera. The product was shipped and delivered surprisingly quickly. All around very happy with the product and order. 
18309 0 Do not like it 
18310 4 Nice quality product. Excellent price! Delivered on time. 
18311 4 I m not a camera person...not what I expected... 
18312 4 very good 
18313 3 This is a good bag, and is a very good size. I just wish there were more padding included to make it a bit more stiff. 
18314 3 Very durable, nice camera bag. It gets a little tight when packing more than one lens, but mostly fits what I need. It looks nice and I feel my camera is protected. 
18315 4 Really Nice Case 
18316 4 Awesome camera, great features easy operation. 
18317 1 In fact it was not a good buy. The product has good resistance, but unfortunately my shaft with the cake support bar, which causes the two wheels never touch the ground. Also bad finish of the wheels that generate some shaky movements. 
18318 4 Cleans better then expected. I got it for my ASUSZ T200 and it cleaned my wife s ipad better then her cloth. 
18319 4 Happy with product. 
18320 2 The app for the phone sucks I have HTC m8 I can download the videos and pictures but I when I watch the videos no sound 
18321 1 Love some pieces but the tripod stand is not sturdy, gave it to the kids to play. Many pieces missing in the package too. Not happy, will not recommend it. 
18322 0 1st pair I purchased worked ok for several months until it stopped synching properly. The new pair never synched properly and I was not able to return it because my first photo shoot was after the return period. Very disappointed. 
18323 4 I just unpacked and assemble and I m very happy with it. The seller shipped it quickly, it was double boxed and arrived in excellent shape, even all of the light bulbs worked. The quality is very good. I would buy from this seller again! 
18324 4 Great camera. Use it while boating, camping. Fine photos and meets all my expectations. 
18325 4 Good Quality. It came with Nikon D3100 bundle. So nice to have this once if you buy bundle. Personally I don t use it often though. But yeah sometime you required this. If you are not buying any other lens 18mm-55mm and 55-200mm will work great for beginners. 
18326 3 Not as flexible as i was hoping, but it s very sturdy. 
18327 2 Not bad. 
18328 4 Great. The perfect cost effective solution to water fun with my coolpix. 
18329 4 Really nice strap. Works just as your expect. I almost bought one of the Black Rapids straps, but this one is higher quality and more attractive. Looks damn sharp 
18330 3 Excellent product ! Thoroughly recommend - super for glasses ! 
18331 4 I AM SURE I WILL LIKE IT, IF I CAN EVER PURCHASE ONE. HAS BEEN ON BACK-ORDER AND MAY NOT BE AVAIL. FOR ANOTHER MONTH. 
18332 3 I purchased this item for my 13 year old granddaughter. She likes it, but has not used it enough to offer meaningful feedback. Delivery was prompt. I was surprised it was delivered on Sunday. 
18333 3 Fits perfectly and easy to hold onto. looking forward to using it in Hawaii! 
18334 3 Work good and last a long time on a full charge 
18335 4 Excellent. More than I expected. It has so many functions that you may not have to use the retouching programs. The Zoom is awesome !! 
18336 4 SO COOL 
18337 4 Great product! 
18338 4 Nice device. Clear and compact enough to carry easy. 
18339 4 Excellent walking stick with camera mounting at good price. 
18340 4 The system is great. Simple to install and makes you feel safer. 
18341 4 nice little camera 
18342 4 Great grab n go back for your DSLR, and a few lenses and accessories. 
18343 4 Even it is not perfect goods,but still has all the key features a security camera needs. 
18344 4 Great for cleaning eyeglasses and small screens They can be easily stored in your pocket for that on the go cleaning 
18345 4 I got one and then bought one for my wife. They are a simple point and shoot that does a good job of taking photos. 
18346 4 Handy 
18347 2 Charger works great! I like the fact that you can charge you batteries AC/DC. Batteries not so good! 
18348 2 Waste of money. Save you dollars and by a good macro lens 
18349 4 Once installed, I was able to increase my original GPS from 4 satellites to 9 and fly safely. 
18350 4 Perfect fit. Same as the ones that came with drone 
18351 4 Great everyday lens, need the hood to prevent glare thought 
18352 4 nice 
18353 4 Great camera still learning how to use it properly 
18354 4 great Companion to my Pentax K-50 
18355 4 These are like some smaller ones I bought for eye glasses except much larger and a better value. They are great for large screens or any surface I do not want to scratch. They are one of the best I ve ever used. 
18356 4 Very nice night vision picture quality for the price. 
18357 4 Perfect replacement unit for my aging ADEMCO - Drop in replacement, didn t have to program a thing. 
18358 4 I have already used a few of these packs and just started on the shiny stars pack! All the film works great and I love love the themes! I def recommend this pack as it was also such an awesome deal!! I use this with my Instax 8 
18359 4 The battery last a long time. Simple to use and to download. They produce surprisingly clear video.exceeds my expectation. 
18360 4 Perfect 
18361 4 Battery last for very long time and quickly charges. The power of this Flash is far more than I expected. Time between firing the flash is very short, leap change compared to Canon 430 EX II Flash 
18362 4 Fast shipping, just as expected! Thanks! 
18363 4 good quality product. I ll buy it again. 
18364 4 Easy, fast, safe and comfortable! Easely fit a 24-70 2.8L ii 
18365 1 Brought two as gifts but you get what you paid for. The power adapter gets &#34;hot&#34;, not warm but hot. The unit would restart for no reason. The speakers are low end. Would not purchase this again. 
18366 1 to big and complicated to use 
18367 4 Camera case is very nice and my camera fits nicely into it. It has good padding and places for batteries. I didn t want something too big. Perfect. 
18368 3 Worked as expected. 
18369 4 Great plan 
18370 0 Followed directions, plugged in, little spark, died. 
18371 4 good quality 
18372 1 very shaky if attached to moving position. 
18373 2 cheap 
18374 3 Great lens to be used with Canon DSLR cameras. I hated to purchase the Canon brand lens for so much more, when I only use this lens as a hobby. Great zoom lens for a good price. 
18375 4 Works perfectly, fits perfectly, highly recommended !! 
18376 3 Works great Wish they offered a round version for people with glasses 
18377 4 Great Camera. Got it to send pictures with the Wi-Fi. Works great. Easy to use. A+ 
18378 1 It is good to have it, but hard to use it, 
18379 4 Excellent multi section monopod. Reduces to just over 15 in to easily fit in small suite cast. Easy to extend sections quickly. Strong when it is extended. Light weight. 
18380 4 Love this zoom lense. You just need to make sure you have a way to stabilize it for. 
18381 4 It works great 
18382 1 Broke after a month of use. 
18383 2 Works but it came in a case far to large for a 58mm filter. Also the case had a large crack going down the front of it. 
18384 4 Great 
18385 4 No problems 
18386 3 re-furbished- so was not sure about the quality. met my expectations. thanks 
18387 4 There are many times I want my binoculars but its just not easy to lug around my full sized set. These are serious binoculars with good optics, weight, and feel. As with all Vortex they carry a no hassle lifetime replacement 
18388 4 The charger was fast and the batteries held their charge. The entire set was great for my trip to the Caribbean. 
18389 0 pictures were blurry and underdeveloped 
18390 4 Great little machine. The company is having growing pains in the customer service area, but the device is first rate. 
18391 4 Very Good Product 
18392 1 You can only replay video that was recently recorded using your mobile device. When going back a day or two it takes a very long time if at all. The image and sound is delayed. Not worth $10 a month in my opinion. 
18393 4 The best lens on the planet! Dont settle for anything else..., 
18394 0 No support. 
18395 4 All lenses should be protected with this inexpensive &#34;insurance&#34;. Works as advertised and expected of a Nikon product. 
18396 4 My toddler pulled Grandma s Nikon D50 off the kitchen table and broke the bayonet ring on the lens. Rather than buying a new lens, I was able to replace the mounting ring! 
18397 4 Perfect 
18398 0 poor image, poor focal range, not for small places, poor battery, poor software and manual, sound better than image. it s a middle range USB pen drive more than a camera. 
18399 4 Loved this set! A great versatile set-up, looks professional, obviously not quite what you would get for hundreds more dollars, but I was very impressed. The lightboxes are really nice and the backdrops are huge and work well. The carrying cases are very nice. 
18400 0 Very low quality battery. I get about 40 shots on a fully charged battery before it goes dead. By comparison, my 3 year old Canon battery gets 300+ shots on a charge. Would not recommend. 
18401 3 The clamp has an adjustable rubber band inside the jaws. Useful in keeping the clamp from sliding forward. The gooseneck is eghh... 
18402 4 GREAT!!!! 
18403 4 great product used it to take family group pictures and didnt have to hire a photographer to do it set it up and used the remote to take the group picture with love it 
18404 4 Durable and stays in place.. Highly recommend 
18405 4 Good quality glass with convenient carrying case. 
18406 4 Very sturdy and fits camera well. 
18407 4 love the product works very well. Can charge multiple products and is very well made. 
18408 4 Word great.Idea Product 
18409 4 Delivers as promised. Works very well and included the 12v and european converter. Great price 
18410 4 good quality 
18411 3 The user interface leaves a lot to be desired and the motion alert and recording fails constantly. But it is cheap and otherwise works. My one worry is that if the manufacturer ever stop supporting it via their website then the device is entirely useless and inaccessible. 
18412 4 Works great. Just what I needed. 
18413 0 The insight switch would not connect to the internet. I was on the phone with Belkin and they couldn t help. The cam connected to the internet but it kept losing connection. Sent them back. 
18414 4 love it.nice and light.compact.fits my canon perfect.nice traveling case 
18415 4 excellent deal, no complaints , and fast ship, thanks, -J 
18416 4 The LCD screen on your camera could easily be scratched. You re crazy if you don t use a screen protector. 
18417 4 The build quality is superb. It s solid and balances nicely on my D610. Produces beautiful portraits with nice bokeh. A favorite of mine. 
18418 4 perfect 
18419 3 thanks 
18420 4 ok 
18421 4 used mine in a dive off the coast of la jolla and it took great pictures and videos 
18422 4 Simple to operate. Gives more value for the money, and gives quality pictures & videos. 
18423 4 Wow what a camera 
18424 2 Works but takes a lot of practice. 
18425 4 Fantastic 
18426 1 A little bit disappointed with the unit. Picture is not as bright as another brand that I already have. Besides that when displaying some of the pictures it cuts them so I can t see the picture complete. I bought it to give it to my brother as a present. 
18427 4 Bought for grandson. He has used several times and loves wearing it while he captures all the action. Fits comfortably and doesn t slide. Even wore it white water rafting. 
18428 4 good deal! 
18429 3 Good quality for the money. 
18430 4 First class! 
18431 1 Picture makes it look big but in reality it is very small. 
18432 0 It is super tiny and incredibly uncomfortable. Not sure what human this was designed for :-( Sorry. 
18433 4 Perfect - works great! 
18434 4 Works well! 
18435 4 very good 
18436 2 The Flycam 5000 is harder to balance then it looks. I am still working at it. 
18437 4 Works well with Olympus C5060 and C7070. 
18438 4 It s convenient to dive 
18439 4 Product received in a timely manner and as listed/pictured. Thanks! 
18440 2 No need for warning tag. Price can be reduced 
18441 4 Nice camera. Order came on time. 
18442 4 Product packaging solid, fully applicable to outdoor sports, good quality, practical,I have used the suction cup and it did a fantastic job,and will use other accessories for a free time. 
18443 4 One of the best thing i ever did i think this lens is magic,of course lens like this Tripod must if you want the best result. 
18444 1 Seemed cool at first, but the problem is that while it shows what you re taking a picture of, this item attaches to your lens and will blow out photos due to the way the lens attaches over and doesn t compensate. 
18445 4 Good system overall. I wish the codec was in a .mov or .m4v format instead of .avi. 
18446 4 Love them 
18447 4 Easy to install, fixed my problem (scratched lens). A whole new case is only $15, but save a few bucks and this works just as well. 
18448 4 My niece loves it 
18449 2 good, but I like the other one I purchased better 
18450 4 works great 
18451 4 very nice 
18452 3 Awsome product! I used everything in this kit and it was all A ok. My only complaint being the plastic is a lil cheap not high rated type I feal. 
18453 3 cool nice pic and video for the money 
18454 4 Easy to assemble, fun to use! 
18455 3 Super nice and light for a case this size. Wish they made it for the Phantom 3. 
18456 4 works great. 
18457 4 I am So glad to have left the Nikon/Canon world behind, after playing with this x body for almost a full month there s NO way that I would go back to the BIG two. A+++ 
18458 4 Good for the price 
18459 4 Great 
18460 4 Perfect lens for my camera shoots. Sharp pictures. 
18461 4 Good, just don t use it while diving 
18462 4 Works great and fast delivery. 
18463 4 Fantastic binoculars for the money. Watched 2 wolves fighting over an elk carcass with 2 grizzlies in Yellowstone on their first use. Wouldn t have been possible without them 
18464 4 Great product, works as it should. Delivery was fast and without issues. 
18465 3 Worked perfectly. It lets me use my old Vivitar telephoto lens on my Nikon D3100. 
18466 0 I couldn t resist the 2-pack, but quickly lost both due to a not so secure fit. The eyepieces just don t seem to click in the same way as the OEM part does. 
18467 4 PERFECT 
18468 4 Good size for my camera. Plenty of pockets for accessories. 
18469 4 Awesome Charging Device ... Works exactly as advertised! 
18470 3 Pretty awesome compared to most tripods I ve seen. I only wish the feet were heavier for two reasons - so they d drop and fully extend without pulling, and to be more stable. It s nice and light for carrying. 
18471 4 Product as described...works great 
18472 2 I bought this as a replacement for my battery pack, but this one broke off in the camera as I was pulling it out. Worked great, but not super heavy duty 
18473 4 Although it s cheap, it works swimmingly. I sank my point and shoot in the sink to test it first and then took it to Cancun and the Green River in Moab (not in the same day). Worked perfect and kept the camera dry. 
18474 4 American Craftsmanship at its BEST. Far nicer , more functional, and less expensive than the OEM grip!!!! 
18475 4 This is exactly the head I was wanting to get. 
18476 3 Great, my brother love it. 
18477 4 good 
18478 4 I lost my charger and this was a very cost effective replacement. It even came with a battery when I only needed the charger. So now I have two! I haven t tried the car charger yet so I can t comment on that item. 
18479 3 works well as advertised. Beware that Disney parks do not allow it to be carried inside just like other parks. It can not fit in the pocket. But otherwise does its job well. 
18480 0 the filters came unprotected one of them is al scratch up. Will return them. 
18481 3 Great Product 
18482 4 Battery and charger work perfectly!!! You brought my old video camara back to life!!! Thanks!! 
18483 4 Perfect 
18484 2 Just used it once for in car race video in dirt oval stock car worked fine. not go pro quality I suppose but for 50$ i ll use it again even had a bit of a wreck and no glitch.no trouble when used with PNY brand micro sd card. 
18485 0 When you zoom out you get a black vignette. 
18486 4 great price for a great product 
18487 4 A little difficult to figure out when you first get it. But once you figure it out, it works great. Great for long exposure photos. 
18488 3 All is ok! 
18489 4 It functions the way that I expected. 
18490 4 Great batteries. Would buy again. 
18491 4 Works Great 
18492 2 Build quality is cheap, but that s the norm nowadays. Light as a feather. Battery life is less than I expected. Projector works as expected, enough to share pictures and movies while out and about. 
18493 0 All batteries came expired. Very disappointed 
18494 2 Some access were missing. 
18495 3 Good wireless camera system. A little bit of interference based on distance. 
18496 0 garbage 
18497 0 Not the best quality, it is hard to make the lens move, sometimes as if it was stucked and the pictures are not really high-pitched. 
18498 4 Great camera. I ll be buying another soon! 
18499 3 Fits my new Jamstik+ perfectly, with room to spare for strap and other accessories. One star off for the extremely long shipping time, but the wait was worth it. 
18500 4 Great price! 
18501 4 Came with everything I needed to put it on and the instructions were easy to follow. 
18502 4 rec d as promised and as advertised 
18503 4 As advertised. Works just as well as the OEM batteries and I will buy more in the near future. 
18504 2 I wish I could say I love this bag. Oddly, it doesn t hang right. It s very uncomfortable to carry. Hangs at a strange angle. The snaps are very difficult to close. It looks fabulous, but I never use it. It s become a storage bag. 
18505 2 They do work, but are pretty cheap on the tie on end 
18506 3 Looks good and fits well - no complaints. 
18507 4 Fast delivery and worked perfectly! 
18508 4 I haven t had a chance to use the tripod with my camera yet but it looks good and easy to use. 
18509 4 Aircraft flys extremely well but am having problems with video. This is the second one. DJI seems to be having problems with transmitting video from aircraft to controller. Ritz Camera is very very fast with their shipping. Very pleased with Ritz. 
18510 0 Door doesn t even close right, the foam inside does not hold the battery tight the place where the iPad is advertised to go is filled with foam. Would not recommend this to someone else 
18511 3 follows up on any issue. Good quality cabes. 
18512 4 Do yourself a favor and swap out your heavier aluminum rails for some of these. 
18513 4 This lens is great 
18514 4 worked great! Good value. 
18515 4 Best E mount lens out there 
18516 4 this is easily be the single best monopod i have ever owned! 
18517 4 good camera, night vision and internet based monitoring 
18518 4 So far, I really like this camera and their technical support is awesome. Today I needed assistance connecting my camera to my i-phone and the Foscam technician (Calvin) was very informative and helpful in assisting me. 
18519 4 Henry was a good tech, Henry helped me with clearing up my major issues I was having with my connections.Thanks Henry for your help. 
18520 4 Perfect---quality and shipping! 
18521 4 This strap works great, it is adjustable to fit hand size and camera height. Noticeable increase in stability. 
18522 4 Works Great! Love the Price 
18523 3 This tripod will work; i like it. 
18524 4 Fit perfect. Good quality. 
18525 3 Good set of pouches to protect your lenses. 
18526 4 I thought it was going to be difficult to apply. Maybe I would get it off center or with an air bubble but it was very easy to apply. Now my new camera is protected. 
18527 4 Great price and great quality. 
18528 0 I took this to my trip to the Philippines. One of the activities I used it for was tubing - horrible decision. My GoPro snapped off and got lost in the river! Thank goodness the locals found my GoPro after a couple of days. 
18529 4 Works well. 
18530 3 The camera is very good and easy to use. The case that I bought, and was recommended, CASE LOGIC DCB-302 is too small for this camera and someone made a mistake suggesting this casa to be purchased along with this Olympus. I will return the case. 
18531 4 I mounted this to my airsoft gun, fits on their tight, didn t need to tighten after a few hours. 
18532 4 As someone who uses my gopro a lot for just random purposes, it s awesome! I ve had it now for about a month, but I ll do a proper review later on. So far though, I take it everywhere! 
18533 4 Product was exactly as described and at a great price !!! 
18534 3 excellent purchase, exactly what I needed! 
18535 0 One product is missing. 
18536 4 grabacion aceptable 
18537 4 Cheap, works well with my J1. 
18538 4 Works great, gives a little more room when turning the camera to portrait 
18539 4 Great it works 
18540 4 Works as advertised 
18541 4 Works great! Refurbished but it s a very small accessory with a small case designed to attach to the strap. The WPS button and indicator light is an easy setup along with the Nikon WMU app. 
18542 4 It was prefect beside that strap that made my camera drop but it okay so I am happy 
18543 4 Does the job! 
18544 3 Thank you 
18545 4 Very strong item. I would highly recommend this to protect your high dollar camera on the DJI Phantom 3. 
18546 4 Incredible barging 
18547 4 Owned one exactly like this and loved using it. It met my every need; traveling, pictures for newspapers and monthly articles about our club. Was happy to be able to find the this camera to replace the one that was worn out. 
18548 4 Perfect size for mirror-less system and 3 lenses. Using with a Sony a6000 and could not be happier. The belt stores when not needed and included should strap helps to stabilize. Think Tank is, as always, very robust and well built. Thumbs up! 
18549 4 Excellent 
18550 4 Great Product .....easy to use ! 
18551 3 Not easy to adjust the length But it seems that the quality is good, I felt that the product I ordered was too old or used because the stick was covered by dust inside its Box. 
18552 2 Works well but the swivel isn t very strong and can t support a camera in every position. 
18553 0 I was very disappointed to find that the lens opening on the case is too small for the Samsung WB350F. The lens opens but then shuts down. Bummer! It s too bad as it was just what I was looking for! 
18554 4 Holds a charge, better than the one that came with it. 
18555 0 Horrible Item. Cameras POS. 
18556 3 Having trouble with this camera. Went to the Bahamas and it only took a few pictures. Very disapointed. 
18557 3 So far so good. Will see how batteries hold up 
18558 4 Great filter...is very much as promised by the manufacturer...I have the X1CPL polarizer and it is just as good. 
18559 3 Needed sleeves to hold index cards on a magnetic white board, these worked out. 
18560 4 I love it. 
18561 4 Very Nice 
18562 1 I like the style of it but the functionality just isn t there. The sliding on switch didn t stay in the on position so if you wanted to turn it on you had to hold the button down. It did come with 4 color filters which was cool. 
18563 1 Pretty good although it will not work with the Sony vixia hf r62 with the battery attached. You can remove the battery and stuff it in next to the main unit. This would have been helpful to know before I bought. 
18564 4 Easy enough for a monkey to install. Prettier than a foscam. 
18565 4 Good product I enjoyed using it 
18566 4 Very good battery, I use it all the time, thank you. 
18567 0 Cheap! Broke 
18568 4 Works like a charm, people think these are real cameras! 
18569 4 Love it 
18570 4 Great product for the price. Nicely made and the length is long enough to cross over your body. The camera lays about hip length. The color is vibrant and the leather gives a secure feeling to hold a heavy camera. 
18571 4 very good 
18572 3 Bought for Son s birthday. Awkward to download data. 
18573 4 good product. Fits my lens perfectly. 
18574 3 good little tripod. could be more sturdy, but overall, not bad quality. 
18575 4 Very good!! Works very well..we can see in the TV...it was awesome!! 
18576 4 Great price, great fit, fast shipping - a five star seller! Just as good as Nikons - as if they really make them!!!! 
18577 4 The cords arrived very quickly and they are really nice heavy quality 
18578 4 Nice product for sure. Very quickly delivered and was everything I had expected. Many thanks:) 
18579 1 I expected the front to hang from the back cover when you take off the front cover to take a picture, but it always falls off. It looks great, fits great but not useable in the field. I returned this. 
18580 4 I like these better than my other baluns that are longer with a swivel - this connection isn t flawless but more dependable than the other kind 
18581 2 Picture quality is decent, so is audio stream. However the motion detection is very inconsistant. Sometimes they alert for no reason and othertimes you can walk through the room with no alert. 
18582 3 Great product. Haven t had a change to use it much yet but it seems to support my Vortex 85 spotting scope well, 
18583 4 Excellent lens with great optics. A little challenging to get in focus off hand in lower lighting, but it will force you to take better thought out shots. It s my only lens carried on my camera now, even though I have several. VERY flexible! 
18584 4 I really love the quality of these lens covers. perfectly easy to used and step up. Now to get the other size for my smaller lens. 
18585 0 Stop working after the 2nd day. 
18586 4 Cannot tell the fake TV from the real one. 
18587 4 Love this lens on my Nikon D3200. I bought this for a walk around lens for vacation however I haven t had it off the camera since getting it. 
18588 1 When used in the manner describe on the back, all the labels will be upside down to the user. Seems like a design oversight/flaw. It is also much smaller than other similar charts making it harder to find what you want or read the (upside down) labels. 
18589 3 You have to take off the front ring of the LX7 and the Neewer cap bayonets into its place. Its not very elegant looking but works very well. I have had it on the camera for a couple of months now and it works flawlessly. 
18590 0 Simply didn t work ...bought 2 thinking first one was defective ...got 2nd one ....same results Kept giving me same reading regardless if I increase intensity of my flash or light source ....or near pitch darkness. 
18591 4 they are great quality, but I though it would work with reflectors, but it only works with lights 
18592 4 Excellent... love the camera and accessories so far... Not sure why Panasonic doesn t include the adaptor and batteries with the camera like other brands... 
18593 3 Works very well with my camera 
18594 4 It is a great little camera 
18595 3 Holds photos well very cute but only has 49 pockets NOT 72 
18596 4 Love the look and the feel. My son bought a pair and raved about the support. I totally agree and I have sensitive at times painful feet. 
18597 4 Fits great to my Phanton 3 drone 
18598 4 Great little camera -awesome pictures. Usually always just use my phone, but decided to try small camera for Hawaiian vacation 
18599 4 Great product, good price! 
18600 4 Love it 
18601 4 Great camera I only wish it am with a sim card. 
18602 4 So glad I got extra batteries for the GoPro!! Dive trips with multiple dives and video made the extra batteries a must! 
18603 4 I have a small point and shoot and wanted bag that would be a better fit. Yes this bag is the better fit for my needs 
18604 4 Strong design and perfect size for my monopod Oben ACM-2400L 4. 
18605 4 It did exactly what I needed it to do it stable , lightweight and easy to transport 
18606 3 camera fits well in case. Product received promptly by seller 
18607 4 love it all!! Great camera! 
18608 4 Good product. Works as advertised. 
18609 4 Happy with product. 
18610 3 Everything was there... save for the instruction book. Would really like the instruction book. How can I get the instruction manual... other than I love the camera. 
18611 4 Love the high-speed sync without the typical high-speed sync pricing! The recycle time is a little slower than I d like but, for the price, it s worth it. 
18612 4 this is a nice case to put all of your equipment in 
18613 4 Perfecto por ahora. 
18614 0 Diferent 
18615 4 Really enjoy the camera strap. Had a Joby previous and was unhappy with the thin strap. The shoulder pad on the Fastfire is much more comfortable. I prefer the attachment point of the Fastfire. Never really felt secure with the mounting point on the threaded tripod hole. 
18616 3 Fit well on Sony a6000. Pain in the A** changing battery! 
18617 3 Quality is okay for the price. 
18618 0 takes great photos but the stripes ripped off!!!!! don t buy cheap plastic. I want a full refund 
18619 3 Easily telescopes and is pretty durable 
18620 2 Definitely small. Good for specific uses but going to need something bigger to hold everything I have. 
18621 4 Nice product, all is well 
18622 4 Good 
18623 3 Still being exposed... 
18624 2 It does work for it s purpose. However, when the mount is screwed all the way in, the GoPro doesn t line up straight with the way the handle faces. 
18625 4 Works just like a cell phone screen protector! It was perfect! 
18626 4 Easy set up. Simple to install. Cameras work really well. 
18627 4 Great case for the price to protect my lens. 
18628 2 I was expecting this bag to be smaller. from the photo it looks like i can fit the fuji polaroid 210 perfectly in there. I can fir the camera in there and a small village. good quality though, shipped quick so kudos. 
18629 2 it would work great with light weight speedlight but not able to lock well on heavier ones 
18630 4 best thing ever to be created 
18631 1 Didn t fit camera. 
18632 0 camera does not record to micro sd, the software that came with it doesn t work either. 
18633 4 Fast delivery. Works great! 
18634 3 Highly recommended for The Phantom 2 users! This gimbal is awesome! took my ability to capture smooth crystal clear video from my gopro hero 3+ Black to a whole new level! 
18635 4 Every accessory I can think to use. 
18636 4 I received the batteries promptly and they are as advertise I am very please. 
18637 3 Works good. 
18638 4 Review for GoPro 4 Ssolid snug fit with all parts and pieces. no cover for the additional UV lens though which stinks but at least they throw in a lens cover for when the UV lens is not on. Overall very happy 
18639 4 great 
18640 3 I bought this per recommendation of my mentor, who s an experienced prof photographer, and he was not mistaken, it s a great product! 
18641 0 Samsung s server has been unavailable since I received this item on Thursday (today being Sunday). Friday when I called Samsung, they said they were sure it would be taken care of by the end of the day - it wasn t. 
18642 2 Wouldn t fit my camera good quality those. 
18643 4 Great product! I live on the gulf of mexico and have used my Smapole about a dozen times in the saltwater and it has worked great and shows zero signs of wear or rust! 
18644 4 Received quickly, all parts and items were accounted for and in condition indicated. Great set of accessories at a great price! 
18645 4 I love it,bought it few years ago for Canon T1i and it still works fine, using it with Canon T4i. 
18646 4 great back up batterys and came quick in mail 
18647 4 Installed it myself. That went smoothly all parts labeled clearly-what plugs into what-etc. Did need help from support to get the remote access working Amcrest s support was excellent. Still exploring the feature-rich capabilities of the system. Very satisfied with the product. 
18648 4 satisfied This product was very satisfactory and much fun for all the family I would highly recommend this product delivery was prompt. 
18649 0 These are a joke. Wasted my money 
18650 2 It is an older version no metal on locking holes and fastners are not double throw. 
18651 4 Great little umbrella for location work. Inexpensive, easy to use. 
18652 4 Much better than the 5X5 cloth you get with your glasses or sunglasses. This is exactly what I expected and the price was right! 
18653 4 Love it! 
18654 4 This is a fantastic camera for the price. It has a very good quality image, both day and night. 
18655 4 Very good video quality, best bang for the buck. 
18656 3 It s always good to have a few extra batteries handy 
18657 4 I am using this, along with several other cameras, in my vacation home in Arizona. I use it in conjunction with an INSTEON HUB, these work together very well and was easy to set up. 
18658 4 Looks very nice and the quality is very good. Is a bit uncomfortable to open take off the whole thing when you want to take the memory card out, but it s not a big deal. 
18659 4 Great deal 
18660 4 This was a great purchase 
18661 4 Coolest invention ever, I use it all my smartphones and you get stability of steadicam on your smartphone. 
18662 4 Product was as advertised. 
18663 3 not bad 
18664 4 excellent product. 
18665 4 SFSG....and you can t beat the $$$$$ 
18666 2 It s an &#34;okay&#34; system. The software is a bit tricky to sync with the camera itself. The picture quality in daylight is fantastic, but in low light the picture quality is poor. Seems to work fine. Does the job. 
18667 0 Cheaply made, only use for storage, will fall apart if you actually try to ship it. 
18668 4 i use it all the time on hikes and under water 
18669 4 it was the exact size I need it! 
18670 4 This camera is amazing and takes the best pictures! 
18671 4 Good quality, and firm connection without being too tight. 
18672 4 very well pleased with this purchase 
18673 4 I bought this camera because i was seldom at home,i could speak directly with my family when i was on a business trip. 
18674 4 Great deal 
18675 4 Great tipod for travelling fits every backpack 
18676 0 poor quality. It looks and feels like a cheap plastic toy. 
18677 4 Exactly what the picture and description shows. 
18678 4 they fit my camera perfectly... 
18679 2 Not able to keep lens pen in pen holder. Side Pockets are very tiny and unusable. Padding is not great at the bottom. 
18680 4 Great price! Much better quality than I was expecting. Very user friendly. 
18681 4 It works great on my camcorder. 
18682 3 Good camera for the price. 
18683 4 Great it works. 
18684 0 Cheap! software was not user friendly. The siren kept going off at every movement because software wouldn t save settings to shut it off. I ended up getting the Kodak camera to replace this. 
18685 3 Recommended by Amazon when I bought my Sony A3000. Just barely fits camera and extra batteries. Consider something bigger if you plan on carrying extra lenses, chargers, etc. 
18686 2 Good quality, has trouble staying on when moving fast 
18687 4 Bought this as &#34;refurbished&#34; - Nikon approved. Delivered &#34;as new&#34;. Saved about 60% so was well worth it. 
18688 0 The product s instructions were in Japanese and completely unusable. Previous review was not accepted by Amazon 
18689 4 Works great 
18690 0 Camera plastic mount broke off after 6 months. 
18691 4 good price.... 
18692 4 Awesome lens! Totally great from a business perspective. You have to have lots of room to get everything in view when indoors, but the bokeh is beautiful and it s quick and sharp focus. Totally love this lens! 
18693 3 Works great but rotation left/right has not been working. 
18694 0 lite came to me in an obviously pre opened box.lite is missing battery holding part.no instructions leaflet to advise type of batteries to use.i only paid 10 bucks. not worth the hassle to return it. 
18695 4 Works great. Fast delivery! Awesome. 
18696 4 good little camera for my needs. 
18697 4 legit 
18698 4 Just what I wanted in a flash. I needed something with more power than the built in flash. It s great for inside photos, but I wanted it for photos of owls in our tall trees in our yard. Love it! 
18699 4 great 
18700 4 Love how this thing softens the light, love how lightweight it is and its so easy to install and compact to carry, definitely im buying more and ill be switching the softboxes for these 
18701 4 GREAT 
18702 4 Danny @ tech support was patient, knowledgeable and awesome!! 
18703 3 The strap does not stay on. Lens protective filter works great. 
18704 4 Works fantastic!!! 
18705 1 Missing 1 of the sd cards. 
18706 4 Ugh...it works! Lol. Good construction and fit both tripod and gopro fine! 
18707 4 I got this for my 67mm canon lense to proactive from scratches. Works great and my lense cap fits over it nicely. 
18708 4 Great 
18709 4 easy way to carry an extra battery 
18710 3 its a good head strap for a cheap price. use it a lot 
18711 4 Give you that assurance of tight fit. 
18712 4 Great product 
18713 4 Great for the price. Bought new camera and only had one battery 
18714 0 Worked for a week then stopped now no computer recognizes external connection - bummer Cannot easily replace is Nikon has specialized connections at 12 buck a shot this is not acceptable 
18715 4 Received it on time and was exactly what i was expexting 
18716 0 The balance is not good, The grip is very loose, They should inform buyer you may have balance issue. 
18717 4 Great Product! Came in a timely matter and so far I am very satisfied with this Camera. I m very excited and confident when purchasing from this buyer. 
18718 4 Great filter! I didn t notice any discolorations. 
18719 4 Love my Yongnuos :) fast shipping and awesome product! 
18720 4 Perfect 
18721 4 My Polaroid 100 Land Camera is up and kicking thanks to this. No need for a battery mod. We ll see how long it lasts, though. 
18722 4 This replaced another mount. It is an exact match for another brand. Worked great and at a very good price. 
18723 4 This little camera is awesome!! Great footage 4 wheeling in the woods, crystal clear, picks up all the surrounding sounds 
18724 4 OK it all! 
18725 3 The battery is gerat! However, all the other stuff like the &#34;off-brand&#34; charger can be without. If I had to do it all over again I would get the Nikon Battery & the Nikon Charger to go with it (if it was offered that way). 
18726 4 Does what it should. 
18727 4 Works as expected. Decent build. I don t use it much but it does the job. 
18728 4 Now I am able to film underwater. Yeah! 
18729 4 These are great! I hate fingerprints/smudges on my iPhone and macbook screens. These cloths work great. Love them. 
18730 3 Good lens for the price. If you would liek to save money get this lens 
18731 4 It works great,I like it. I will buy more of it,it helped for recording vedio during my last crusade 
18732 4 It is very good quality! I love it! I just hope they would make it in different colors too. 
18733 4 Everything in it was just what I needed to get started. For the cost of another battery I got got so much more. The case is lightweight and well made. Plenty of room for the camera, spare battery and a few lens covers. 
18734 4 this is one of the better ones I got this to use in case of power outage for use with a portable solar panel it is nice to have the option 
18735 0 The threads for the screw that holds the hot shoe were stripped when it arrived. The screw needs to be longer. Functionally useless, but not worth the cost of shipping to return. 
18736 3 Worked great and was very inexpensive. Leash could be a little longer. 
18737 4 I used some other light diffusers, that worked great but was much bigger, this diffuser works great as well but is much more compact, small and carries a big punch. 
18738 4 Good 
18739 4 Very nice compact tripod. Its a great travel or hiking tripod that can handle moderate weight. 
18740 4 So far I enjoy my little camera. It takes beautiful pictures. No complaints. 
18741 1 It s what I m looking for. But the batteries won t charge. It seems that the charger & battery are not compatible. 
18742 4 item as described 
18743 4 You can shoot a lot more stable on hand held shots. Very comfortable. 
18744 4 Excellent video and easy to use. 
18745 3 ilikeit 
18746 4 Worked well. 
18747 2 Door sensors do NOT work with vera 
18748 1 Could have used some instructions on mounting this plate. 
18749 4 This camdera produces photographs that equal cameras 3 times the cost and with automatic focus and exposure setting. 
18750 4 No complaints 
18751 4 These performed perfectly! 
18752 2 When it s not falling off my camera due to the crap connector, it takes great pics! 
18753 4 Item arrived fast and secure. High quality accessories. 
18754 4 Generally I wouldn t write a review for such an inexpensive item, but I thought I would pass on to anyone considering this that it works perfect for me. I have it on my Canon EOS 70D. I slipped right into the hotshoe and does it s job perfectly. 
18755 2 Excellent visual quality. Plastic screen cracks easily if not secured in shatter proof box when packing in suitcase when traveling. 
18756 4 Great product. I use it on every photo session. Works great 
18757 2 Works great!! 
18758 4 Excellent service. Great product. 
18759 4 Good 
18760 1 S***ty, tinny audio quality. Buy if you love mediocrity. 
18761 4 Loved it! 
18762 4 Works well - did have it jump off the network once and re-establish a connection with a different IP address but was easily fixed. 
18763 4 Excellent item, quick to post, Thanks 
18764 4 Arrived as promised and earlier than I expected. 
18765 3 Didn t line up exactly but we made it work. Excellent quality!! 
18766 4 Love this! Took it snorkeling and parasailing on vacation and it did an awesome job! 
18767 4 Very useful for shots that require a long exposure time and a tripod. Love it! Works perfectly with my Nikon D3200. 
18768 0 the monitoring device stopped workingwith less than 4 months of service 
18769 3 The quality is not quite as good as the real GoPro stuff, but for the price it s definitely worth it, very good value and better quality items than I was expecting. 
18770 4 THIS WAS BETTER THAN I EXPECTED! I want to start up my YouTube channel and I needed a camera to do so :) this one takes incredible videos and audio isn t bad either! 
18771 3 kenneth was great and walked me right through 
18772 3 simple & functional; easy to use 
18773 4 okay. 
18774 4 this is a huge improvement over the standard plastic snap that comes with the case. This will outlive the camera for sure. 
18775 4 Thanks for fast delivery and the best product came in a good way with everything written and shown in the pic 
18776 4 Great battey. Lasts and then some 
18777 3 I was a little worried if it s going to fit around my vanguard tripod, it actually attached snug on the foam part of the leg, only one lever to control both of the angles was not the best, but it got the job done for now... 
18778 4 Giving this 5 stars now because it is a well made product and an excellent value. I revisit this after I see how long the batteries last - that is key! 
18779 4 We got my 13 year old a dslr for her birthday. Needed a fun looking, but sturdy and secure bag. This fit the bill perfectly!! I m a photographer myself and would love one for myself. 
18780 3 Good price vs Nikon product. Nice inclusion of a charger. Theses are small batteries to start with so not spectacular but as good as Nikon. 
18781 4 Work s great. No problems at all, charged the battery quickly. Arrived quickly nicely packaged. 
18782 3 Excellent product at a great price. 
18783 0 Does not fit! Pieces are too tight. 
18784 4 Vincent was very helpful and very patient with me for me not having no knowlege of cumputer and the camera s are great I would highly recomend the camera and again THANK Vincent. 
18785 4 Very comfortable and lightweight! 
18786 4 As promised. 
18787 3 Cool. 
18788 4 Quick delivery and great product 
18789 4 It was quickly delivered. Very good. 
18790 4 I am finally able to carry and store my gopro properly. 
18791 0 I couldn t get it to work 
18792 4 Works great! 
18793 4 10 points. everything was as expected 
18794 2 Toy binoculars! These are okay if you re a kid who wants to use their imagination. These binoculars do not focus very well and I would only recommend them for someone under the age of eight. 
18795 4 Great pack! 
18796 4 works great and cant beat the price 
18797 4 Beautiful photos. So glad I got this filter. 
18798 4 Like the product, Great tech support by Walter 
18799 2 I wear glasses and they some what work out. It s good enough for a substitute. Its annoying adjusting them sometimes. 
18800 4 i love it 
18801 0 Sooooo the cameras are black and white picture with no resolution and they aren t really wireless... Also did not receive the remote needed to control the LCD screen.... We just set them up, and they did not meet my expectations. 
18802 3 Almost perfect. Works fine and all but has a few scratches. I wish it was flawless :I 
18803 0 Sometimes you get what you pay for. If you really want a gopro, buy one. This has everything you need but just doesn t work. I have no memories of my trip because my camera didn t work! 
18804 4 Just a nice lil charger. 
18805 4 Well designed with sturdy pouch. Good value. prompt delivery. 
18806 2 This frame did not fit my GoPro Her 4 all that well, it blocked the shutter button. 
18807 4 These are great. I ve been using these straps with my go pro to record working on a vehicle and the accessibility is awesome 
18808 4 Ok 
18809 4 This camera is SO extraordinary-- I recommend over any other camera on the market-- easy to use, AMAZING sound and video/image quality... And at a reasonable price! I m just super over the moon about it! Also shipped in a secure and expedient manner! THANK YOU!! 
18810 4 Works well and attaches to the lens easily without binding. Be careful not to over tighten. 
18811 4 Ordered this for my daughter She loved it ! Takes the cutest pictures 
18812 4 Very good construction. You can design your own layout as I did to accommodate my Sony NX3 video camera. There are many storage compartments of various configurations to store and organize the way you work. This is a professional bag with the option to shoulder or wheel your equipment. Nice.... 
18813 4 Just what I expetded 
18814 4 Works great 
18815 4 Works exactly as expected. Great product! 
18816 4 I was very pleased with my purchase. It was shipped right away and exceeded my expectations. I will purchase from these guys again. 
18817 3 Good value for the price! 
18818 4 Yes....just what I wanted and expected. Convenient, strong, can be used as a walking stick or a camera monopod. 
18819 4 I love the film for my new camera. Received on time! 
18820 3 Nice system. Not the best but works fine for the size and the cost. 
18821 3 Not bad. So far so good 
18822 4 Awesome. Everyone loves it at parties. 
18823 1 A little loose and comes off sometimes on its own. 
18824 4 Protect your investment and make sure it doesn t sink to the bottom of the ocean. Comes with a new backdoor and everything you need to affix it. 
18825 4 Excellent reasonably priced product from camera producer Nikon. 
18826 4 Henry Campbell helped me figure this thing out. great camera but setup is a doozie. called customer service and sat on hold for a few min and he had it figured out. 
18827 3 I ended up returning this item, because I found one that I liked better, but that was all just preference. It was a good lens, I just decided I would rather have a macro lens. 
18828 3 The soft box is is great quality, the mount was wobbly because the two Philips screws were stripped, i applied some glue and now it is very sturdy. 
18829 2 Not big enough for all my equipment. 
18830 4 Works great, thanks 
18831 4 Great lens but everyone knows that already 
18832 4 I love this!!! Amazing kit 
18833 3 not as tight as expected 
18834 4 great seller - delivered as promised! 
18835 1 Melts when left exposed to the sun! Don t leave your helmet locked to your bike and expect the camera mount to be there when you finish lunch. 
18836 1 over priced period 
18837 4 Great product. I use this as a backdrop for short informational training videos and interviews. Well made and appears it is built to last. 
18838 4 Fantastic deal! Couldn t be more satisfied with this digital camera. For all the accessories you receive along with the camera itself...Best deal we ve ever found on Amazon!! Awesome! 
18839 3 Had to take a file to the plastic mounting foot so it would fit the hotshot on the camera...now it works pretty good. 
18840 4 works well and much less expensive than brand name 
18841 0 Not happy at all. Wrong plug in for US 
18842 3 Comes with everything except the clip for the brim of the baseball cap. Would be nice to have that included. 
18843 4 Great value! 
18844 4 I do enjoy it design and Bluetooth operation and connection. 
18845 4 By far my favorite lens. Quality is crisp and sharp, takes excellent low light photos and depth of field is superb. I would highly recommend this lens 
18846 2 I m confused, some people say yes it does come with an AC power adapter some people say no. Jeff Thoele 
18847 1 I purchased 2 and I need to return one. 1 works fine and one failed to turn on 
18848 3 &#34;Good points Easy setup Well built chassis Long enough power cable&#34; 
18849 4 the best case for a single camera !! 
18850 4 I use my go pro 3+ as a dash cam for my motorcycle trips. Extra charged batteries are a must. This is a great product. 
18851 4 Great Diffuser, I was looking for one that fit my Neewer NW670 / VK750II Not exactly shaped but fits perfect. I definitely recommend it. great product! 
18852 4 Awesome!!! Totally worth the money and I still haven t got to play with everything yet. 
18853 4 Great product, for the price. Worked as advertised. 
18854 4 Worked great. Wish flip was still in business. I would recommend gettng a tripod that has legs that wrap around railings and that are flexible. Otherwise this tripod was perfect. 
18855 3 Seems like a great tripod so far! top notch, with a great bag included. The only thing I miss is an arm to pan. 
18856 3 Rubber strap would ve been easier than Velcro. Kinda hard to fold and put away without loosening Velcro all the way 
18857 4 Everything was as advertised...great way to carry/store GoPro and accessories!!! 
18858 4 Excellent! 
18859 2 Jerks when rotating. 
18860 0 Not even worth one star. Bought this for our cruise and took pictures while snorkeling in Cozumel. Returned home and went to download pictures and they were gone. Can t return for refund because my time limited was up the day we got off of cruise (yesterday). 
18861 4 Very sturdy blocks 
18862 0 The camera I received didn t work I charged it several times even tried a different usb and tried an electrical outlet and it still wouldn t hold charge. 
18863 4 Products are very worth the money. Only object that I don t like/can t use is the tripod, it s very cheap. Other products are on par with GoPro brand products 
18864 3 Great addition to the kit for my Camera. Tripod is a little flimsy, though. You get what you pay for. 
18865 4 fits nice and tight. tighter than stock parts. 
18866 4 Fit great. I feel better knowing my new camera is protected. 
18867 3 Works great, very inexpensive. I used wasabi batteris for my Sony and Canon DSLRs, other brands just cannot match performance and compatibility. 
18868 4 Works just like it shows. 
18869 4 Does the job well... 
18870 3 It works perfectly. 
18871 4 Loving it! 
18872 4 Best suction mount for the GoPro Hero 4. 
18873 0 Don t waste you re time or money. I got it free as a promotional and still feel ripped off. Video is beyond horrible, pictures are un viewable and embarrassing to show to anyone. You would get better video and pictures from an old smoke signal flip phone. 
18874 3 Works great -- I just wish the microphone sound was better quality like D link. Otherwise so far, so good. Great value. 
18875 4 This is a great case. Nicely put together. Of course, every case is particular to your camera and how you like to use it. So I m managing to make it work for me. It can be used in a variety of ways. 
18876 3 Great for travling 
18877 4 Just a good accessory to have. I bought both my grandson and husband one for their Go Pro s. 
18878 3 I had some trouble connecting to my wifi because I use google chrome. Tech support was very helpful. Too bad this doesn t work to watch the outside from behind glass 
18879 4 great buy, good price. 
18880 3 works great! 
18881 4 Works as described. 
18882 3 Pretty easy to use, but you have to make sure the images are the proper size or else it stretch and distorts the image. 
18883 3 Title says it all 
18884 0 Grandson s Christmas present. Wasn t really submersible. 
18885 4 Way better than the generic ones... spend the extra. 
18886 1 Does NOT come with memory card. 
18887 3 I m very happy with the case. It fits perfectly and the strap is a perfect length too. I will defanetly recommend this case to anyone. 
18888 4 A++ 
18889 4 Just what I expected 
18890 3 It fit my Audi perfect. The price was lot better then dealers. 
18891 4 After experimenting with different bags this is the perfect bag. I really feel my camera gear is safe and secure. 
18892 4 Superb lens. Lovely bokeh, sharp even at f/1.4. Nice colors and contrast. 
18893 1 Its started to getting hanged while recording. Media card is not read properly. Lost some images also 
18894 3 I would have give 5 stars BUT, it missing one memory card. Everything else was good, delivered on time and well packed. 
18895 3 After receiving my replacement stick I m quite impressed not so happy with the part that hold the phone. I find the spring to be a bit cumbersome but overall it does its job. 
18896 4 Awesome is about all I need to say the constriction is solid and out has good features I have a mini ball pivot on top, with a Canon sx50 camera and it supports it easily I really Like this for shooting on the go very stable base 
18897 4 Excellent product, fast shipping. Buy without hesitation. 
18898 4 ok 
18899 4 Thanks for the fast shipping. Looking forward to future business. Also it was an easy install and works great!! 
18900 4 More than I expected and better quality could have hope for. 
18901 4 This is exactly what I was looking for to be able to take pictures on the water with out the glare off the water. 
18902 2 hard to manuevar 
18903 2 Fantastic filter but Does not work with 24-105 canon 
18904 4 Very easy to apply. 
18905 4 Good value for the size and quality. Outside is hard enough to protect against normal wear and tear and traveling and inside foam pockets have a versatility of use. 
18906 4 Fair Price good Product 
18907 4 Love the gimbal, works great, the app could be better. 
18908 4 Beautiful and functional custom soft release button. Expensive but well worth it. Has an rubber O ring that keeps the button from unscrewing, unlike the cheap plastic soft release buttons. Highly recommended. 
18909 1 Initially, it is only OK for a emergency situation as backup to take a few more shots. After a while completely useless. I have had my original Canon battery twice as long and it is still going strong. 
18910 4 Very useful tripod and great value. Give it a shot! 
18911 4 Very good quality film 
18912 4 fit perfectly and happy with the purchase. 
18913 4 Works great with my D3300. Just turn it on in the camera s menu and push the button. I believe this to be a camera thing, but you must focus the scene using the camera s shutter button ahead of time. 
18914 4 Great item just what I was looking for. 
18915 4 No problems with it yet.. everything fits fine. Good price too. 
18916 4 Excellent price and very fast shipping 
18917 0 not a clear view distributor, not a new product, product is not under warranty. call clearview direct 
18918 0 Battery did not fit Had to be returned 
18919 3 I don t want to give a bad review because it wouldn t work with my NVR system (Q-SEE QC838) My mistake for not checking the right specs! 
18920 4 nice 
18921 4 It s a high quality material , easy to use, perfect size for shot a portray. 
18922 4 It s amazing..we loved it.. 
18923 3 Works great 
18924 4 Quick delivery, item just as described. 
18925 3 Not a toy. Need to get used to it. Learn how to fly it 
18926 0 How do turn. On the camera 
18927 3 I really like it but the diffuser fabric is already starting to pull away from the seams. 
18928 4 Camera take great videos. Came with lots o accessories. Waterproof case works great. Great camera for the price. You can click on the links below to view sample videos. Sample Video @ 1080p/60fps daytime: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpDS_aVjA5Q https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZ4A19GoEFk Sample Video @ 1080p/60fps at night https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UQICoPTPlw 
18929 4 Shipped fast and amazing quality! 
18930 4 I love B&W product 
18931 0 REALLY BAD, THE THREAD FOR THE SCREW IS MADE IN PLASTIC, AS SOON YOU MOVE IT WILL BRAKE APART...DONT BUY THIS EVER !! 
18932 3 great little flying machine for the price. It s a great little quad to learn on. I originally got a dud but the company had great customer service and sent me a new one. This one flies perfectly. It can handle good bumps and crashes as well. 
18933 2 My Yongnuo YN600EX-RT does not work as Nikon Slave in iTTL mode, firmware version 1.8.3, anyone face the same problem. Nikon Slave M mode was working well. 
18934 4 Absolulty love it and I recieved it quick 
18935 4 Time saver. Easy to use. Nice and bright. Has audio too! 
18936 4 B+W is a trusted brand and first class product. 
18937 4 super easy to use. Works GREAT. 
18938 4 This cover will be perfect for my Peerless watercolors. Oh and I did get 2 in the pack! 😊 
18939 2 Well I bought mine for YouTube and I think the video quality is amazing but talking thru it isn t and it sounds like I m a far distance away so that s very disappointing. Taking photos with it is okay but in probably going to take it back ! 
18940 4 Better specs than the OEM item. No issues with charging or delivery. 
18941 3 The product was described as having no damages except a small scratch, but the automatic cover does not open or close all the way. I can easily push it down with my fingernail so it doesn t bother me. Especially since this was offered at such a fantastic price. 
18942 4 Exactly the product I need. This is very useful and the quality is outstanding. Gives me the angles that I need especially when doing outdoor shots,group pictures. Holds my big IPhone tightly without worry. Price is very reasonable and delivers swiftly. 
18943 2 Very good quality case just like my Lowepro sling bag. However, this is just not a fast out great travel case like I have for my old film cameras. Nothing wrong with the bag, but I don t love it like I do my sling Lowepro. 
18944 4 Works great and costs much, much, much less than a Canon original. Awesome. 
18945 2 Seems solid. Just didn t trust it for my SLR. Wife has it on her pocket cam know. 
18946 4 Just I hoped. Great deal 
18947 4 Easy to install and operate, good quality, functional. 
18948 4 Great amazon purchase! Thanks. 
18949 4 Good basic wired remote 
18950 4 so far so good 
18951 3 very good 
18952 4 excelente 
18953 0 Made of very cheap materials. The Velcro is barely on. The design does not allow for it to be angled down. 
18954 4 good so far learning it with flash kit 
18955 3 Was perfect but had some white spots 
18956 4 Great except for the swivel lightening shoe that broke hopefully the replacement does not brake! 
18957 3 It works fine 
18958 4 Pricey but got my Canon EOS Rebel up and running. 
18959 3 Good product 
18960 1 This item only came with the speed ring insert and not the actual speed ring as shown in the photo of the product. 
18961 4 Excellent and fast shipping 
18962 3 Very much like the camera. Four stars for not great anti-shake capabilities. 
18963 3 It works well. Sometimes, it is difficult to place though. 
18964 4 Came fast and work as expected. 
18965 3 Works well. I get two days of hard use with it with my Sony DCR-SR45 camcorder. 
18966 4 excellent 
18967 4 Does just what you need it to. Count only goes up to 399 but you can set it to go forever if you need more exposures. It won t work for exposures less than a second long. 
18968 4 Old GPS quit working, so the drone quit flying. After many minutes of trouble shooting and youtube videos thought that i would start with this bugger. Worked like a charm. Fairly easy to get to and replace (even for someone with big hands). 
18969 4 Bought this as a present for my father. This device was his first experience with a &#34;smart camera&#34; with a touch screen. It took a few days but he has become quite the wiz at using it, editing pictures and videos, etc. Basically this was a huge hit. 
18970 4 This monopod is definitely lightweight and durable.... Had it for about a few months, and no problems yet! There really isn t anything else that is worth saying, because this product is exactly what it says in the descriptions! No lies or anything. 
18971 4 Happy that I purchased this package will now have extras on hand 
18972 4 purchased for my wife in 2010 and its easy to use and takes great pictures 
18973 0 bad design, when power on P3 yr gimbal will hit it. 
18974 4 Worked out great. A little noisy but okay. 
18975 0 Shooting even a few minutes of video drains the battery. The regular Canon battery, though it has lower capacity, has no problem doing such short clips. Fully charged battery, two or three minute clip, first the battery warning, then the camera shuts down. Returned it. 
18976 4 perfect. 
18977 2 My son enjoyed this for 1.5 days and then it broke after hitting a tree branch. Needs to be more durable. 
18978 4 This case does fit the old/outdated Magellan 6000T with room for the AC adapter. 
18979 2 Good price, but not for the model television listed. Bulb can be carefully removed and placed in housing from old bulb 
18980 4 such a great case. goes well with my pink camera. 
18981 4 This case is fantastic. It fits all of my extras in here along with my new Gopro Hero 4 Silver. Very happy with this purchase and the price was great too. 
18982 0 Looks like a simple cradle but I really can t write anything about it because I didn t have a need for it as a result of returning Removu RM-R1. 
18983 3 The only problem that I had with this is if you utilise other products - such as the Vello Snap-On LCD Screen Protector - it does not fit well.Without any other attachments works well. 
18984 4 Works great! Easily adjusted and the positions are solid. Great little tripod. 
18985 4 Everything works exactly as advertised; the colors on the monitor are accurate and sharp. I also use it on my tv. (my tv runs off a 2nd computer) Easy to use, nothing else. It s awesome. 
18986 3 Great camera, works perfect. I only wish it was a bit more compact. 
18987 4 Works perfectly. Delivered exactly as promised. Vendor was very responsive and easy to contact and work with! 
18988 4 Excellent product. Very happy with the quality and craftsmanship. 
18989 2 It works as advertised. I lost the directions and forgot how to use it. 
18990 4 Nice! 
18991 4 Great for taking wildlife shots. 
18992 4 Will they come back ? I need some more 
18993 3 I have been using these tubes for a couple of years now. They aren t fancy but they get the job done. You can do really quite amazing stuff with them. I shot a video recently about how to use them. https://youtu.be/qtW4uCNjqzU 
18994 4 As a long term DIY video home security guy I have purchased many different cameras. If these led illum. has as a long life then this is the best in my experience. 
18995 3 Good photos, was a gift for a 7 year old child. Only downside is lack of a rechargeable battery. 
18996 4 very good material 
18997 3 Works just fine for the job 
18998 4 Works great and is very useful. Came when promised 
18999 4 Works as advertised 
19000 4 On time, as advertised, with contact info if needed. A great value. 
19001 3 Great product with excellent support 
19002 4 Very good, I like the camera! 
19003 4 Great speaker. Thanks 
19004 4 Really good product. Velcro makes the fit snug and secure. Only tried it on around the house but think it s going to be great while hiking and dirtbiking. 
19005 4 Works perfectly in my camera. 
19006 4 Built like a tank, durable, the pinnacle of B+W quality. 
19007 4 Its exactly what I needed 
19008 4 Pelican cases are fantastic! The pre-cut perforations make customization easy. They really protect whatever you put in them. I live in the desert, where very fine dust is the issue, but I have to believe that if our fine dust stays out, so will rainwater. 
19009 4 Fantastic, customizable. I keep my GoPro cameras and accessories in this. It s perfect for bringing the cameras to some other location or just to bring everything to the garage without juggling a bazillion expensive gadgets. 
19010 4 Works great! 
19011 4 simple to use and works well 
19012 3 Straps are a little thin and the rubber bottom hits me in the small of my back. Otherwise it is a great product with good protection and storage. 
19013 3 cant compete with the Canon dslr in quality but its still a very good camcorder .easy to set up and quick too .you can always make up for the quality during Editting .so? 
19014 4 The picture quality is great. I use it mostly as a dash cam. The screen is real small and I have not been successful with connecting to wi-fi. 
19015 3 Good uv filter for panasonic lx100 
19016 4 its an awesome camera 
19017 4 Good product 
19018 0 Falls out easily. 
19019 4 Good product and nice price 
19020 4 great product and fast delivery! 
19021 3 Good, compact, powerful, simple scope. Not working with Windows 7 though. Only XP.... 
19022 3 These are small, which is specified and what they are meant to be. They are much easier to take along than a large grey card. The only problem is learning how to use a smaller card which is user error, nothing that the card did. 
19023 0 Its too small and feels like it is going to brake :( 
19024 4 the best low coast drone out there. great trainer... for the money, its the way to go.... 
19025 4 Great product ... Exactly what I needed 
19026 4 Very nice light weight case. Plenty of storage areas for batteries and accessories, and fits the Phantom 3 Professional with prop guards perfectly. A bit pricey but worth 5 stars for quality. 
19027 3 great buy 
19028 3 For the price it s hard to beat. I plan to sell it to upgrade to a 70 200 in the near future though 
19029 4 good 
19030 4 Does exactly what I wanted it to do -- for my GoPro... Easy to use. 
19031 3 Easy to use and does well as a cary along quick clean. 
19032 4 Great lens ! Great price 
19033 2 good idem 
19034 3 good product 
19035 4 This is one of those things that I hope I never see how well it works. 
19036 4 Exactly what I was looking for 
19037 4 I have zero complaints. This tripod is easily the best I ve owned and it feels so solid. 
19038 4 Love it. 
19039 2 Cool 
19040 4 I was worried about the film being left in warm conditions but it develops perfectly and looks great. Film was within use by date. 
19041 4 Great product easy to use, works as designed. 
19042 0 Not what I spected for $24.00 dollars. ...one sheet of badays plastic, I ended buying a cell phone screen protector it work bettet.. 
19043 4 Great for selfies and tripod videos from different heights and angles. 
19044 4 Just what we expected! 
19045 3 Great product for the price!! 
19046 4 Worked like a charm! 
19047 4 Good product 
19048 4 The camera is outstanding so far, sharp images at day and at night. Worths the money! 
19049 2 Doesn t fit my Nixon Coolpix cameras eye holes at all. Much too wide to slide into slits. 
19050 2 This is NOT a neck-strap! Don t be fooled. Def a great shoulder strap though. 
19051 4 I use my own tote bags and just move this from purse to purse when I need my camera. Love it! 
19052 4 Works like a charm with both my Neweer units and both d5100 and d7100 bodies. 
19053 3 I wish the batteries came with the protective plastic cases like they have with past orders 
19054 4 Inexpensive, but works perfectly...charging the batteries a little faster than the charger that came with the camera. Excellent product at an excellent price. 
19055 4 Works great. I use it attached to the end of my pole and it is able to hold it up. 
19056 3 I bought my first tripod Its good I like I saw many videos before buying it The only reason i am giving 4 stars is the one button to open it wide was coming off the body So i have to glue it and now it cant use wide legs 
19057 2 Too big ....need a smaller version with the same loudness. Something you can comfortably fit in a pants pocket 
19058 4 A must have for the extra chargers to keep at the ready. 
19059 4 Arrived fast, easy to attach to my T3i 
19060 4 Love the look at night. The adhesive on the lights could be better. I had to tape it to keep it on. 
19061 4 Using this in several trips abroad = quality product that is worth a few extra dollars. 
19062 4 Great item! 
19063 4 Great quality. Sturdy and seals perfect. 
19064 4 Work Pefect 
19065 4 No problems with product and/or delivery. Works as described. 
19066 4 Everything arrived ok! Great product. 
19067 4 Absolutely perfect. This is a steal for the price that it s at. I highly recommend it. It comes in a little case, so you can put it in there without worrying about it getting scratched up. As someone who is experimenting with long exposures, this was a great lens. 
19068 4 Good quality definitely! They have nice little details. The elastic fabric (I dont know the technical term) feels so soft but firm. They have the non-slip coding, which makes the firming pretty steady. 
19069 4 These are such AWESOME lights. I use them when I film my YouTube videos and they make my videos so much better when it comes to lighting. 
19070 3 Backdrop is good for the price that you pay. The screen sizes are very misleading as the picture makes it seem like it is meant for a larger screen but they are relatively small sized. 
19071 4 Fast delivery and works fine 
19072 1 The screw and metal loop on the bottom started rusting right away. 
19073 4 Works perfectly! 
19074 2 I just bought this camera and i dived for 21 meters and when i went out it does not work anymore.. 
19075 4 Awesome flash for the features and the price. Works great with my 70D! 
19076 4 I use this for all my batterys and it works perfect with no problems Will recommend this to anyone 
19077 0 not to work never got chance try until to late to send back 
19078 4 Great for travel and makes all your shots even better...was unsure what to expect but love them. Got it as a gift for my sister, said they were amazing and worked on both iphone and ipad, Would buy again! 
19079 4 Seems to sometimes not work with my android (it looks like this is ONLY capable with android phones) but I think it might just be me...so far I really like it! 
19080 0 thought it came with a sd card , did not explane well and i could get better quality from an old phone camera do not buy this. 
19081 4 Really helps with low and high angle composition 
19082 4 Very useful & practical size. 
19083 4 So much more reach than the prior 11-16. So bright , so clear. Almost no distortion so little or no software correction when processing in Lightroom. Wonderful for taking pictures in the forest. I photograph sun rays in fog and see none of the flare reported in prior copies. 
19084 4 Factory product, quickly delivered. 
19085 3 perfeito pelo preço 
19086 4 Great travel camera. Takes two AAs so it s ready to go when you are, no need to charge before you go to that important event. 
19087 3 I bought this to store my new ViewSonic PJD5255L video projector. Even though it is designed to be more of a camera and lens case, It fits perfectly. Only complaint is the plastic hinges and latches don t seem too sturdy And may wear out if used often.. 
19088 4 Nice product and it just works! 
19089 0 would not focus correctly 
19090 4 This is a small company that offers a quality product and really extraordinary customer service. I rarely have the time to write recommendations. MooJou Enterprises moved me to make the time. 
19091 4 I bought this as a birthday present. The preteen loved it. I think it might have been her favorite gift. 
19092 4 Item arrived as promised (very fast). They also included a 32gb micro Sd card (thank you). Definitely would purchase again and will look here for any accessories. 
19093 4 Fast and Very Early. I have a lot time in my hands to finish the preparations on my Son s Birthday 
19094 4 What a great price. 290 refurbished is the way to go. !! Searched everywhere for the best deal and im pretty satisfied. I still need to mess with the camera a little more to learn more about it but overall im liking it :) 
19095 2 Quality great but disappointed about the print direction. It doesn t state it will be portrait printed. The picture of the item shows it to be landscape which what is needed and would work best for pictures. 
19096 4 As advertised. Works great. Short delivery time. 
19097 3 Had to send one back to HTC due to water getting into the unit. Will be trying it in water again soon, as that is one reason I got this. However they replaced without issues. 
19098 4 Works like a charm 
19099 4 It is definitely a good buy with the bag that I bought to place it in. 
19100 4 Fits my Fujifilm and 2 lenses well. Build quality is solid. 
19101 4 I got the item on time and nothing damaged. It is all they said it would be. I lreally like it 
19102 4 i took this to a trip in Rocky Mountain, mounted D7000+17-55 f2.8 (quite heavy combo) to it. Surprisingly, this little guy is very sturdy and the ball head is very easy to use, and I enjoyed it a lot. 
19103 3 Works well. Would get a &#34;I LOVE IT&#34; rating if it was not so heavy. 
19104 4 Arrived on time and as described. I have yet to really test the product but so far so good. 
19105 4 excellent product! meets and beats the quantum tubos at 75% less cost. And I use them in the harshest environment of all. underground photography all over North America! www.dupontphotography.com for examples of the work. 
19106 3 i would have preferred the VR mode in addition to auto and manual 
19107 4 works good 
19108 4 These float wristbands for holding camera are great. they have enough size and float capability to keep any small waterproof camera from sinking. Plus, they provide excellent cushioning when in a camera bag. 
19109 2 Fast delivery. Heats up a bit. 
19110 2 It broke really soon, on/off button did not work in some months. 
19111 4 Pretty good item Work great and nice 
19112 4 Great little video camera. Easy to use and great picture quality. I bought this off of Amazon Warehouse and got a great deal. 
19113 4 Perfect. I love it so much. Super cute, colorful and trustworthy 
19114 4 Really nice quality photos! My room is very dark and normally when I take photos, they tend to be really dark and unappealing. With this lens, it really does make all the difference in color and clarity wise!! Definitely recommend. 
19115 4 Use it for an exercise device. Great power saver. 
19116 3 Great little flash dose a wonderful job very easy to use and understand no unnecessary mumbojumbo. 
19117 2 there were a few useful items and other things i ll probably never use. Bt considering the low price, the useful items seem well made and they make the package worthwhile. 
19118 4 Fit great, feel great, and work great. 
19119 0 too small. 
19120 4 This tripod worked great for me, fits all me phones including big ones like Samsung Notes. Great value. 
19121 4 Nice for off iPhone flash. 
19122 4 works exactly as advertised, and very reasonably priced. using it with a Canon 7D 
19123 0 Camera did not take pictures or movies when installed. It registered on the controller and the light showed camera active, but no video could be played. 
19124 4 Nice just as they said 
19125 4 Just got one and it works as advertised. Easy to use. Easy to set up. Very helpful as we travel a lot and will be able to keep an eye on our home. Might add a way you can also connect through a laptop. 
19126 3 actually has three mounts! 
19127 3 It works for personal use, no complaints for the price. 
19128 4 excellent product for the price 
19129 3 Make sure u update to 3.0 for 1080 60fps 
19130 4 Wow! Very impressed at the quality of this item. I looked at many other versions and am HAPPY to have selected this one. You will love it! 
19131 4 Great ball head I use this for real estate shooting on the manfortto pro 55 legs and the two fit together like bread and butter. No need to spend more for exotic materials. This combination gets the job done with flying colors. 
19132 4 Excellent camera and price. 
19133 2 cheap. good deal for what it is. 
19134 4 Love this camera and the price was great! The quality of the pictures is amazing and this is easy to use! 
19135 4 This is the best digital photo frame I ve ever owned. Pictures are crystal clear and fill as much of the screen as possible. Very little effort to set up also. Thanks, I love it!! 
19136 4 Ok 👌 
19137 3 Its an exceptionally solid FF for its price. Maybe a little heavy against the lightweight cameras it will likely be attached to. 
19138 2 Nice while it worked. I sent it in to be repaired and learned the repair cost was more than what I paid for the camera. 
19139 3 Great item - good price. Thanks! 
19140 4 Best grip for rollercoasters video 
19141 4 love it but i lost it:( 
19142 3 No issues, it is was it says. 
19143 0 Charger didn t work 
19144 3 This lens is compact, light weight and always come handy. 
19145 4 Unbelievable quality!! Super slim. Amazing clairity. Hoya- B+W- throw them away. If you are reading this - do yourself a favor and click purchase now. I received no incentives for this review - only read the review and agreed. You need this lens. You want this lens!! 
19146 1 Very cheaply made. My granddaughter dropped it by accident and now there is a lens error and the lens won t open so can not take pictures. It is a waste, now. 
19147 3 Good camera at a reasonable price. You really can t go wrong with a PowerShot from Canon. This is actually my 4th one over the years. This model is nice and light and only requires two batteries. The quality of images are great and it s easy to use. 
19148 2 It s OK! Seems kinda useless. 
19149 0 Coats 6$ to return 
19150 3 Great accessory kit. The kit comes with more items than I know what do with them My only complaint is the camera doesn t fit snug in case. I am pleased with kit and would do business with seller again 
19151 4 excellent! 
19152 2 The cap fits fine, but the adhesive for the strap was completely dry and useless. Super glue took care of it easily however. 
19153 4 Everyone knows GoPro is at the top of the Sports/Action Cams. Best camera quality, lots of customization for settings and all around amazing piece of technology. 
19154 4 buuenas camaras 
19155 4 Great thanks! 
19156 4 Works good 
19157 0 I am rather disappointed as the Camera does not appear to have night vision or it is certainly not working. what are my alternatives as I desperately require night vision on my camera. All of my Logitech cameras have night vision and are very clear at nights except this one.???????? 
19158 4 Easy to install. Fit perfect and waterproof. All I can ask for $6 
19159 4 looks real 
19160 4 Is great!!! 
19161 4 nice 
19162 4 charger looked great shipping on point- but due to my own error it was thew wrong one and i had to return it 
19163 4 Soft-sided but very well made. I love the bag and use it every day to carry my K-3II with a 24mm Sigma lens and my lunch to my office. A+++ 
19164 0 This thing is useless. Doesn t work at all. It worked, marginally, for a day or so, then stopped all together. Changed the battery for a new one-still nothing. Zero stars. 
19165 2 Pro: Light and compact Easily adjustable/remove Con: Lack of padding makes uncomfortable after long day if you have a dslr w/battery grip and heavy lens 
19166 3 This item is sturdy and very easy to set up. 
19167 1 I think it would work great if you had sent instruction I could understand. You need to get someone who speaks fluent English to write your instructions. Please send them to me. I cannot use the camera because I cannot understand how to set it. 
19168 4 bang for your buck and still have the whole set going strong. if you take care of it it will last you. very good especially for a starter set in flash photography! 
19169 4 It works. My camera will float. That s all I ask of something like this. 
19170 0 did not work for me with GoPro black and fatshark... could not get video signal. Played around but it never worked. 
19171 4 Great product and great price. Highly recommended 
19172 4 New version of the Fuifilm NP-45 Lithium Ion Rechargeable battery worked as it should. I was disappointed in discovering my old battery charger for the older version of this battery isn t the one recommended for this new version. 
19173 4 I have bought these before, in a 100 pack. Now just hoping there be enough. Well made, no problems. Little slow on shipping. 
19174 4 Skeptical, due to price. Read previous reviews here & decided to buy. Great bargain. So happy I gave it a go 
19175 4 Good protection wish it came in different colors. 
19176 1 after less then 3 days of owner ship the eyepiece will no longer adjust for power setting. 
19177 4 Excellent! 
19178 4 Excellent service, nice product 
19179 3 Easy to use with auto settings, fun to experiment with advanced features. Great camera for the price. 
19180 4 I bought one for my girls but have been using it quite a bit for myself. Good quality and works really well. Love it!!! 
19181 4 works great 
19182 4 Works as promised. Excellent produce at a fair price. 
19183 0 One of the packs was damaged and it comes out filled with ink! 
19184 4 Great buy love my gopro!! The extra batteries come in handy 🙌🏼🙌🏼 
19185 4 For years I had wanted a Nikon and when I purchased the D3100 I was not disappointed. Great camera for amateurs like me. 
19186 4 as described 
19187 4 Really good camera. i took it on my trips over seas and took some amazing shots. I am not a professional photographer so this camera helped in making my shots better. 
19188 4 Everything arrived as described. Thanks so much!! 
19189 1 Short shaft. Didn t fit right. 
19190 3 Very appropiate for the Go pro cam and it´s accessories. 
19191 4 Works like a champ 
19192 0 This is the third one I ve bought and none of them work. They only work for the first 5 minutes you have it going. I kept buying them because they are cheap and I thought maybe I was just having bad luck. But nope, they just don t work. 
19193 3 Good product, will not lose/break your camera--just as soon as GoPro original accessories. I just wish there were extra screws in package--lost one almost immediate upon arrival! 
19194 1 It s ok 
19195 0 Not what I wanted! 
19196 1 Works fine. 
19197 0 Not working as well as when new.. 
19198 0 Don t like it like the white one better 
19199 0 The camera that was supposed to have come new was used and had damage ax they left the batteries inside the camera and the had fallen out and rattled in the box leaving dents and chips in the camera body. 
19200 3 Works well 
19201 4 Purchased this for my son s Gopro, he loves it. Makes it easier when fishing and hunting. 
19202 4 Good quality handy, collapsible white balance reference reflector. Easy to stick in the camera bag so no excuse to not carry it all the time. 
19203 0 Excellent product BUT terrible smell of leather which was not possible to remove at all by several known methods 
19204 4 Amazing for the price! Haven t failed me yet! 
19205 4 works as advertised... 
19206 4 I love, love, love having this when I have to shoot a busy baby or toddler. I can turn on my phones front facing camera and they can make faces at themselves or turn on a favorite movie. Great product. 
19207 3 Super easy to install. The material looks real from a distance but once close and when you have it on your hands, it s a very cheap plastic material. 
19208 4 This is an excellent product. Well made and well worth the money. Perfect for my Nikon 3300. 
19209 4 These are replacements for my old ones and worked perfectly! 
19210 4 I will recommend to my friends as it came quickly, looks nice, video quality is great. 
19211 4 excelent 
19212 4 Pricey but works as it should. 
19213 1 Work, but when my camera given that still has 20 % of the load suddenly goes off and makes me lose Scenes 
19214 4 Excellent product and fast delivery 
19215 3 A good medium range lens. On the Sony Nex7 I found results very good. 
19216 4 goes with the camera 
19217 4 original fit, and perfect ability 
19218 4 I love this camera. Very easy to use. Favorite part is the instruction book that gives tips on taking better pics. 
19219 4 C6722043 TECH ID AR004273 My customer service personnel was friendly and helpful. Thank you D-link for providing me with the safety I deserve with a &#34;very&#34; small business. 
19220 4 I purchased this as a gift for a relative last Christmas. I was blown away by the quality. Great bag for the price. 
19221 4 Great 
19222 4 This was a purchase for myself and I have found it as advertised and a good purchase. The seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with. 
19223 4 The camera was shipped promptly. I have only used it a little bit, but so far it works like a charm. Takes photos quickly and they look great! Very easy to use and so lightweight... 
19224 3 Love it.. bought it due to the one that came in the box was always out. After the replacement I got up to 4 hours without any issue. 2 hours each battery shipped. 
19225 4 Worked just fine.!!! Perfect. 
19226 4 great lens. i use it for northern lights photography and it works really well for capturing landscape. 
19227 2 poor signal very difficult to connect to wifi... 
19228 4 A very nice frame. works well; nice size to have. I am well pleased with product. 
19229 0 Garbage, don t waste your money or time. 
19230 4 Great lens for starting out! 
19231 4 Easy to install, The design is attractive for a sensor. I haven t had the opportunity to see it in action and I hope I never do. 
19232 4 Camera is great and the bundle is a good deal. I love the hero 4 silver. 
19233 0 Not compatible with Nikon D5200. The product description is misleading in mentioning that the product is compatible with all 5000 series DSLRs 
19234 4 A really excellent camera that is wonderful to operate. I m a bit angry that 2 months later there is an updated version that I wish I had. 
19235 4 Very expensive, but it works right, and now I have two. I still wish I could sell the camera for nearly what I paid for it, though. 
19236 4 We haves bunch of these around the house. Like, 5 or so. Weekend have one outside, protected from the rain, in Miami- no issues. 
19237 1 I like it ,but after the first pic it start to shot black (blank) pics. 
19238 4 great product! 
19239 4 Great to have on had in case you forget one or don t have it attached to the bottom of your camera. Looks like original MEFOTO. 
19240 3 As advertised. 
19241 4 Great! Well designed, had room for camera w/ lens plus two addition lenses, flash, accessories, with some room left over. Lots of adjustment on the partitions, a big plus. Just wished it had a chest strap between the shoulder straps. 
19242 4 It flies so easily! Controls are not too confusing for first timers either. 
19243 4 PERFECT. 
19244 1 Turned out not needing The binoculars came with a nice strap. 
19245 4 I got this to shoot video reviews and blog posts. After reading reviews about the knock-off versions, I decided to spend a little more to get the real thing. Also, I love that I can hang my phone upside down or mount it somewhere if needed. 
19246 4 This is the first accessory that I purchased for my GoPro 4 camera. It is easy to put on...easy to attach the camera to the Chest Mount. And, it is sturdy and comfortable to wear. 
19247 3 Good, works perfect but a little pricy 
19248 4 works great, easy to use 
19249 4 Hoya glass is the best. This is a great variable nd filter for video. I ve used it several times now and have never noticed any diminished quality to what I m shooting. 
19250 4 I loved this camera outfit, great product for a great price. Loved the accessories that came in package, liked having everything I need in one deal, easier shopping. Now just to learn how to use it. It takes good pics. 
19251 4 I have used their outdoor camera for years, excellent product. Customer service is also very good--Walter helped me diagnose and fix a minor problem in no time at all; also very courteous. 
19252 4 saved my lens when i dropped it on gravel. 
19253 3 This filter was about 3 stops darker than the ICE 10 stop. Well worth the money. 
19254 0 It was the wrong item and was returned. 
19255 4 After purchasing the Yongnuo YN600EX-RT, I ordered this unit, hoping that it would work. It fits the Yongnuo YN600EX-RT perfectly. I ll probably be picking up a few more Yongnuo YN600EX-RT units, so I ll definitely get more of these Sto-Fen Omni-Bounce units as well. 
19256 4 Very nice quality!! 
19257 4 We love it. Works great. 
19258 4 Does just what I wanted it to do. Makes preparing the camera gimbal for flight easier than the included DJI camera lock. Love the bright color and lens cap. 
19259 4 This is another stand i ve added to my collection of other LimoStudio stands. Cant beat the price and service of these stands. Stoked on this purchase and previous LimoStudio products. Steven Caro SCg Shoe Co 
19260 4 This is easily 1/4 the price you would pay for the same amount of product from any photo equipment site on the internet. Fits easily in a backpack and is an amazing tool. 
19261 4 battery charger works like a charm, I love it 
19262 4 Nice stuff, cleans with no residue. 
19263 2 It is a super long lanyard so I feel like the gopro could hit the ground and then be dragged. 
19264 2 Quality light but the boom stand was poorly design. Over all OK for the price. 
19265 1 The lights are weak, the stands are s***. The best parts are the umbrellas, but especially the bag. It s become my go to case for stands. 
19266 4 Looks good and will do a good job. Is closest fit that I could find for my phone. 
19267 4 Great idea and works flawlessly. Very snug and comfortable and easy to use. Cheap too :). 
19268 4 I use primarily for above and below water deep sea fishing photos/videos with my GoPro Hero 4+. It s strong, light, and easily transportable. 
19269 4 battery charges and holds its charge works well 
19270 4 Excellent product. Rubberized, finger grips, easy mount system. 
19271 4 Easy to use, like!! 
19272 4 Takes great photos and HD video! Love the way it feels in my hands This is my 3rd Sony camera in 8 years - however they are more point and shoot cameras....but I do still use all three of them. 
19273 0 Does not fit 1.25 scope I repeat DOES NOT FIT 1.25 SCOPE.The specs do state dimensions as 2&#34; but also states fits any 1.25 scope.I feel it was wishful thinking on my part but really bummed out my crystal clear night sky. 
19274 4 Rock solid! Best tripod I have ever owned! Worth every penny. There is nothing about this tripod that I don t love. 
19275 1 Good build quality, but did not fit my Sigma 50mm 1.4 lens, despite the listed technical specifications indicating it would. 
19276 4 Great filter...is very much as promised by the manufacturer...I have the X1UV and it is just as good. 
19277 3 Excellent flash. I love it. 
19278 4 Works great 
19279 4 The extra large cleaning clothes seem easier to use and clean better than the smaller size. 
19280 0 Easily hackable. I had the camera on one day and it started moving. Someone had hacked it and was panning my living room. Creepy. Never plugged it in again. 
19281 1 Definitely dont hold a charge near as long as a nikon battery but it does a good job if your photo shoot is short otherwise without backup, your photo shoot will indeed be short lived. 
19282 4 It does what it s intended to do, hold my cam nice and steady! 
19283 1 Light is green as hell, but look how cheap it is! 
19284 4 This film is great and the photos come out perfect. I m still learning with my mini8 camera, but this film is perfect. 
19285 4 good 
19286 1 The screws popped out of a couple of accessories almost immediately. 
19287 4 my granddaughter (13) loves it 
19288 4 love it - nice and sturdy. thank you! 
19289 4 Very good product for the price. I would buy it again 
19290 4 Love the ease of using this camera! 
19291 3 I have purchased 2 of these cameras. They are very easy to set up and I can view and point from my android phone. 
19292 3 Great price. Not sure yet of the quality of pictures. 
19293 4 Yes it saved my life from spending money on that bitch I found her sleeping with other guys , so I dump her , I m so happy today ,thanks again a lot 
19294 4 great 
19295 4 I bought it for my wife as a gift, she is the camera hobbyist, she loves it so much, it adding to the quality of the pictures so much, also very easy storage, isn t bulky, nice case 
19296 0 The instruction are vague and you need more than what comes in the package to install it. 
19297 4 Batteries work flawlessly! Fantastic purchase, especially for the price. 
19298 4 Worked perfect 
19299 4 so far it is performing as I hoped 
19300 4 So impressed with this product! Easy setup and works like a charm. Didn t anticipate this, but I love the 24 hour activity log I can review on my phone. Even when I don t have the alarm engaged, I have a sense of what s going on. 
19301 4 Works as advertised. Very sensitive to sound. Works great with Foscam fi9805W. 
19302 3 excellent product will have to get more 
19303 4 works as expected 
19304 4 Great accessory kit with just about everything you could need for your gopro! 
19305 4 Fit device 
19306 4 great camera for young filmmakers starting out i just used this camera for a short film and it worked perfect id buy it again if i have to 
19307 4 For the price this can not be beat. I use it with my Note 4 and have no issues. I am very happy with it. Holds the phone secure and has plenty of adjustments. 
19308 4 Quality product! The white parts are grippy so that you can hang the tripod virtually anywhere, although you need to take some time to make sure it s balanced because the camera s weight will throw it off and might fall 
19309 4 great 
19310 0 malisimo 
19311 2 Not sure if it the stick or not but my mom that lives in Ark. Can t seem to get it to hold the phone. I live in a different state so I can t help her. 
19312 4 great technical support - Walder 
19313 3 really good for my needs 
19314 3 So far so good. They did well over a 5 hour shoot with about 700 photos. If these hold up over time, they will be a much cheaper alternative to the Nikon. 
19315 4 Great alternate to the expensive gopro cameras. Great features and image resolution for a great price 
19316 4 Fit my camera perfectly and now I have backup lens caps. 
19317 4 Haven t used it yet in the water, but it works great as a handle and for storage. My son stores the charger cable inside. 
19318 4 great tech service 
19319 4 Excellent for what I want. 
19320 4 hope I don t have to use it. 
19321 3 The camera worked well, however the film I received did not work well. Overall the camera itself was a good purchase, and a blast from the past. 
19322 2 Not sure how pleased I am. The first 8 batteries only lasted 2 months in my trail cam. 
19323 4 Works perfectly for my needs ! Couldn t ask for more for the price ... 
19324 1 Broke The second day i bought, i was on a concert.. 
19325 3 fit very tight 
19326 3 Bought this specifically for a snorkling trip during our last vacation. Good performance and easy to carry. Wish I had spent more time learning the menus because glare from the sun made it tough to make changes on the fly. 
19327 4 My favorite favorite selfie stick- so easy to connect, holds the charge long, highly recommended!! 
19328 4 Delivered on time. Great deal! 
19329 4 This battery works just as well as the original battery. The seller gives instruction and guarantees the product. 
19330 4 I enjoyed gazing into the starts at night and I am just so happy that my son finds it fascinating as well and this telescope has been helping him view the stars above in the sky at night 
19331 1 I just really dislike this tripod. Flimsy when fully extended and doesn t feel like it supports the camera well. 
19332 0 Would NOT work on my Leica M. 
19333 3 Direct replacement for my broken lens cap. One of the two plastic springs on the original cap broke and it will be interesting to see if this one is any sturdier. 
19334 4 I called customer support because i was having issues viewing the cam outside of the wifi it was setup on. Henry was very helpful. He got our foscam working in no time. Thank you! I will recommend your services to friends and family. 
19335 2 really weak 
19336 4 Great product 
19337 4 Work great, and have been using them since I bought them. 
19338 3 Just scared people away 
19339 0 It only came in one piece not as advertised! It only has a small piece that doesn t cover my entire lcd for the mark iii such a piece of crap 
19340 2 very big , much larger than other cameras ,, but nice nite view 
19341 2 Good one, but hard to wear and use... I will bet u will not use it often.... 
19342 4 Great product. Very nice camera 
19343 1 Only works up to maybe 5 feet away... nought this to take my family pictures and didn t work for me. 
19344 4 Bought this for big family trip to New York and absolutely LOVE it! Got some great pictures with it and transferring them to my phone has been soooo easy! 
19345 0 It s awful 
19346 3 Works pretty good with my 70D canon. No problems. Kick ass price, too. Canon should lower their prices. 
19347 0 no memory card including 
19348 4 Sharp, crisp photos and videos. 
19349 1 These directions are terrible and I dont like that u have to have a computer to review the images. 
19350 4 I have now had time to use this device and it performs as expected. 
19351 1 bag looks flimsy and does not hold the camera in place 
19352 0 Used this product for a couple of weeks in order to give a proper personal review... WOW! What a piece! Won t focus, can t single to one image, zoom is complete junk, coma is HORRIBLE! Can t even see saturns rings! Go with Baska 
19353 4 Great camera!! The case is nice also! 
19354 4 Must have if you re shooting with a 4BLK. Been through many charges for a few months now and still working great! 
19355 4 I like that this chest mount is so adjustable. I put it on my grandkids over their life jackets while they were wakeboarding (age 10 & 14) and then put it on my husband while he waterskied. My husband has very broad shoulders and chest. Got some fun footage! 
19356 1 This one fits what it says it does just by luck. Very hard to figure out according to info given. 
19357 2 Takes pictures well, and the zoom is great. Dies in 3 minutes if you take a video. 
19358 2 I don t know if it s the paper of the printer, but every picture has a blue tint. The paper fits as advertised but prints odd colors. 
19359 3 Works as advertised, Nikon D-3100. 
19360 4 Go-to lens for portrait and inside work... 
19361 4 I used to have this camera in the year 2007 boy do I miss it! It was so reliable I am glad to see it again! Purchase button CLICK!!! :) 
19362 4 Exactly what I needed to add a Rode Mic to a canon g20. Works great! 
19363 0 Sorry, it did not work after about an hour. Had to return. 
19364 4 Completely transparent. Works perfectly. 
19365 4 Now really I trust.... 
19366 2 Don t spend the money on Sony batteries this brand works just as well at half the cost. 
19367 4 Did a lot of research and glad I ended up with this one. Small but well built and takes great photos. 
19368 4 very light and easy to use 
19369 4 Everything fit and worked great. Nice having the extra battery for backup! 
19370 4 I only have one thing to say...BUY IT...I recommend this to everyone, It s incredible....The last pic is a pic of my Mom s house in a dew drop on a pine needle... 
19371 4 I use these for my wedding film shoots and put LED lights on top to add great lighting. Sturdy stands with great quality to them! 
19372 4 Very pleased with product. Shipping was quick and packing prevented any damage. Will consider when purchasing again. 
19373 4 Guy that I bought this for loves everything about this camera. Was shipped super fast.. 
19374 3 Love the images these attatchments take. Dislike that I have to remove my phone case in order for the lenses to set flat. I use an otter box, I will purchase another case with a smaller lens opening so that the attachable lenses set flat. 
19375 2 the caps don t stay on well, come off easily when bumped. the lens hood was alright, kind of a pain to line up nice though to shade. 
19376 4 These eyepieces are probably One of the best values available.Every amateur should Consider this set. 
19377 4 Ok 
19378 4 Amazing number of accessories and surprisingly nice quality. Will have to take advantage of the online tutorials to be able to handle all the functions of this gem. The bag to hold everything--doesn t. It needs to be about half the size larger. 
19379 4 great construction. Sturdy and well made 
19380 4 amazing product!!! fast shipping!!! just what i needed 
19381 4 Good cap for the Leica televid spotter... 
19382 4 Works great, what a bargain! 
19383 2 its great..alot of attachments..downside not sure what is for what 
19384 4 OUTSTANDING 
19385 4 Exactly what I needed! It s also portable so I can charge my battery anywhere! Amazing! 
19386 4 Had it about a week now and loving it! Easy setup! Great for watching away from home! Love remote tilt and pan!..and especially the notifications when alerts turned on!! Thinking of adding another! 
19387 3 The camera came on time but it was not a white one, it was black and silver. 
19388 4 Best investment EVER 
19389 4 Awesome 
19390 4 A must have they recharge fast 
19391 4 Beautiful case! Fits the camera like a glove. Great for protecting it and carrying it. A great buy! 
19392 4 I purchased this item at a reduced price for my unbiased opinion. I think this is an excellent security camera and well worth what I paid for it. I am considering getting a couple more to complete a remote security setup I have in mind. Easy to setup and use. 
19393 4 cute stuff, everything works. 
19394 4 working as advertised. like it 
19395 4 Perfect substitute at lower $. 
19396 4 What a major upgrade this is for the 50 f1.8 lens. Smaller, lighter & well built. A great choice for the money. 
19397 2 This is my first telescope. I ll probably need to take a class on how to use it. So far, do to my inexperience, I ve been disappointed in difficulty of use 
19398 4 super nice... la recomiendo. 
19399 4 Solidly made, works very well but you need high rings for your rifle and patients to tweak it to preform. Once done its a beaut! G :O) 
19400 4 Batteries hold full charge......great buy! 
19401 4 Worked as expected and came on time.... 
19402 3 I wish to know if this lens is compatible with Blackmagic Design Production cinema Camera 4K (EF Mount) before I place my order. Thanks 
19403 4 Great item 
19404 1 Wasn t as expected 
19405 4 Great lightstand!!!!! What I like most about it is, you can get it low to the ground. Great for setting behind a model and shining a light on the background. Works great for photographing dogs with it low to the ground. Sturdy, well made. 
19406 4 well designed and high optical quality 
19407 1 This tape leaves a sticky residue if left for a long time 
19408 4 I am glad I found these I have 100 uses! Great! 
19409 4 I have been using both of these batteries and this charger for quite a while now, they work perfectly, and actually last a lot longer than the battery that came in the camera! Would purchase again! 
19410 4 Worked perfect !!! Helped me get an expensive camera working again! 
19411 4 I love it It has room for various lenses and sizes. Perfect to take to hikes and get landscaping portraits. Very happy with this purchase!!! 
19412 4 This strap is great for many uses other than preventing serious metal detecting fatigue. It s strong velcro holds up to the toughest of jobs. I use it to hold my hammock together while backpacking. So far I have not fallen. 
19413 4 Arrived on time, and was just what we expected! Great job. 
19414 4 This was a great deal for your Cannon camera. 
19415 3 Simple installation, good quality, setup was okay. 
19416 3 Excellent birthday gift. 
19417 3 GREAT Clarity. Put it on my Sony NEXVG,, the zoom Not 2 smooth, But The Picture VERY Nice. 
19418 2 It is good value for money, but I bought if specifically to protect my Nikon Coolpix camera and expected it to be more of a tight fit. It did not meet my needs. 
19419 4 Works great , good price, stays where put , for mountain biking would be nice to have a shock absorbent mount. In rougher terrain the playback has a little rattle like sound. But so does all the camera s I have tried.. 
19420 3 As advertised. 
19421 4 It is a easy to use product. The price is low and worked better than my friends. 
19422 4 Great product! Took it on vacation and had a lot of fun with it. Easy to use. It fits my Note 3 if I remove the Otter Box. 
19423 0 Does not work. I will be sending it back. We tried it on several different phones. It came in a new box and appeared to be new, but did not work. 
19424 4 heck ya 
19425 4 nice 
19426 4 Works as expected and gpod deal for price. 
19427 1 sucks 
19428 4 Super Comfortable bag, fits my Canon 70D with my 18-55mm lense attached. I dont think it will hold a lense any longer than that with it attached. Fits all my GoPro accessories. 
19429 4 Came on time and nicely packaged. The quality is way better than I expected for such a small camera. Design and finish is very good. Exceeded my expectations. 
19430 4 Solid little stick. Unfortunately, I took it camping and lost the nut before I could even use it. I will glue another one in from my spares... 
19431 4 Awesome kit! It made my trip to Africa easy n efficient. I was always ready for the next shot. 
19432 4 Great strap! Easy to attach to my camera and its so comfy especially if you are using ur camera for a long period of time! Its good quality and I m very happy with this purchase! 
19433 4 Amazing results. Now, the sky comes out blue with white clouds... Most so called Pro photographers do not use this product and the sky looks white on thier pictures. Our sky is not white... Nice product. 
19434 4 Light and very stable for medium size weight. 
19435 4 Robust and durable. 
19436 4 Good product, thank you 
19437 3 This item was just what I needed to mount my GoPro to my road bike and take it on a 100 mile ride. The price was right and it performed as expected. 
19438 4 I was SO happy to get this. Can t wait to use it! 
19439 4 Fantastic !! 
19440 3 Works great but is really expensive. 
19441 4 It read i very good review about this camera and the shipment was excellent and new as described 
19442 3 For the money its a great deal 
19443 4 Excellent lens, one of my favorites I use when I am not using my 35mm. 
19444 3 These are pretty good, I like them. I ve used them for several years now. 
19445 3 functional bag, if a bit heavy. i will be using this as my DSLR bag/purse during my upcoming Italy trip. 
19446 4 Beatiful lens - clarity is amazing. Has become one of my favorites. 
19447 4 Amazing lens, built like a tank, I really love the build quality and the results. 
19448 0 very Poor Quality 
19449 4 Just what I needed 
19450 3 Great cover 
19451 4 Returned this because there was a bunch of wires and I expected less but returning process was quick smooth and easy thanks 
19452 4 Very nice camera takes great picts. 
19453 0 Don t buy, if you have a Galaxy S6 Edge. Wide angle somewhat of an improvement but with a huge drop-off in quality. Discarded. 
19454 4 I gave this polaroid camera to my girlfriend for our anniversary. Pink s her favorite color so I figured she ll love it. And she did! Now e have tons of photos posted on our bedroom wall. 
19455 4 Love it. Works great!! 
19456 4 Great deal for the price works like a charm! 
19457 2 It s a little small for all of the attachments we have for the Go Pro, but is good protection. 
19458 4 A great toy. I can tell you what not to do. 
19459 4 good product so long as one can fly the unit well 
19460 2 Not nearly as good as the Lumix battery but its ok as a back up. Dies really fast. 
19461 4 Extremely easy to use and comes well packaged as pictured 
19462 3 good for the price. Have been using it for a month now in my climbing trips and holds up well. Keep all my connectors, 4 batteries and extra backs and works great. Can toss in my climbing pack without being worried about crushing everything. 
19463 4 once I figured out how to get it on I love it. 
19464 4 Great case. Not too big, not too small 
19465 4 Work great for what I do - YouTube interviews with a DSLR. 
19466 4 Pretty dope!!! I like the fact that it has the plug on the device itself without the dumb cord a+ for that 
19467 0 100% dissatisfied, under the Product Details it says &#34;5.7x5.5x3.2 inches&#34;. Imagine my surprise when I opened the box and fond a 1x1 inch screen 
19468 4 too small but other then that great one 
19469 3 Batteries work fine, and was a quick ship, no complaints 
19470 4 Perfect solution 
19471 4 works as expected and reasonably priced 
19472 4 Small, but large enough that I can find it. Even the dark. 
19473 4 The lens arrived on time and in excellent condition. It is a great portrait lens. I am very pleased with the clarity of the photos produced with the Sony SEL18/B 50mm lens. 
19474 3 fits my aw120 just fine. 
19475 4 Great trail camera. Very sensitive capturing much more than expected. 
19476 4 Great amateur starter telescope, simple enough set up and good enough optics to view the craters on the moon! 
19477 4 Excellent by all means. 
19478 4 OMG!!!!! Thank you very much! We were worried that something would be wrong for that price, but everything came! The shipping was fast and everything inside was perfect. My DOUTHER so happy. It was her birthday present. Thank you very much!!!!!! 
19479 3 Works on my X100T. Documentation leaves a lot to be desired, but I managed to figure stuff out. 
19480 4 excellent lens for the money; the accessory kit was a nice bonus. 
19481 4 Fit much better on my lens than previous purchase 
19482 4 Exactly what I was looking for at a great price. 
19483 2 No good. 
19484 4 Works great - used it underwater and on hikes. Very comfortable, you ll forget you re wearing it. 
19485 4 Great value. We keep it in the car so we can always refresh our batteries while we are away. 
19486 4 ok 
19487 4 GREAT PRODUCT!!!!! 
19488 1 kept dropping off the network - pan feature did not work well 
19489 4 i love it! i thought i would have a hard time getting the thing attached to my camera, but it was easy. does a wonderful job, pleased with my purchase! 
19490 4 Photography is a big hobby for me and this camera does a really does a amazing job. I completely love it and would buy again in a heart beat 
19491 4 All I can say is this is a great deal! Charger & batteries all work great! 
19492 4 WIFE LOVES THIS ITEM 
19493 4 This pole was exactly what I expected and fits perfectly with my GoPro. 
19494 4 Excelent 
19495 4 This turned out to be an excellent, turn-key front light solution for my Parrot AR Drone, so I can fly it, see it better at a distance, and use the camera in low light situations. The light accepts all the factory connectors, and is super light weight. 
19496 0 The protector does not fit the rear screen on of my Nikon D750 well. Would not recommend to other D750 owners. 
19497 4 Works well. No issues. 
19498 4 Good kit and has been working well. 
19499 2 Was too difficult to attach to my Canon T3i. Celltime said they would have someone call me, but never did. Lens produced blurry pictures. Needless to say, this lens was returned at my expense AND a restocking fee, which I feel is unfair. 
19500 4 Works great thanks 
19501 4 I ve gotten some very nice shots with this lens. 
19502 4 Nice product for tripod work. Allows easy access to the microphone port and comes with a decent lens protector. I am very pleased with this product and have used it for approximately ten hours already with my GoPro Hero 4 Silver. 
19503 4 Functions as advertised 
19504 1 Nicely made item, but the cutouts do not fit my Hero 3+ and accessories. 
19505 4 Absolutely love this lens. I m an amateur photographer but this lens really makes taking a quality image so easy. I have had it for over a month and it is sturdy so far. 
19506 3 Works as advertised. The only thing that could be better is a more precise charge indicator. I will leave my OEM charger at home on my next vacation. 
19507 4 Great stick, used in salt-water with zero issues. The anodized blue parts look great and it feels top quality. 
19508 4 Works like original... 
19509 4 Love it! 
19510 4 Good 
19511 4 I use this on top of a monopod - works great, quick to set different angles. 
19512 4 Has been really useful in our camera kit, thanks 
19513 4 And GoPro sells their piece of plastic for HOW MUCH?!? This part is cheap and fantastically well made! Don t know why they went with hex-screws though... But you can replace them if you want. I replaced the one main one with a smatree metal screw on mine. 
19514 4 Works just like it should. 
19515 0 I got a defective item. I have tried to change a new battery. but i have never used it still now. so i want to return it. 
19516 4 works great 
19517 4 I m very happy with the purchase. All items work perfectly for my Nikon D5200 camera. I think the assortment of the products was a very clever one. I recommend this product. Many thanks. 
19518 4 Works as advertised. Very satisfied with this product. 
19519 3 very good product! Love it! 
19520 4 Yes, exactly what it says it does. Works fine and I have extra rings for all kind of needs. 
19521 0 Sucked. I have a rebel t3i which it says it is compatible with. ... it s not 
19522 3 Work as expected. 
19523 4 Easy set up and works great. Have also used foscam which is a huge pain to setup compared to dlink. 
19524 4 Doberman Security met my highest expectations, was easy and quick to install, and provides an extremely alarming signal to deter any possible break-in. 
19525 4 Looks like genuine parts. Thank you China! 
19526 4 Perfect camera. Have seen caregivers not taking care of my husband! So, it was perfect. I could check on him through cell phone when I was gone. I CAN TALK TO THEM, ALSO. 
19527 3 good 
19528 4 It is exactly as described. I would deal with this supplier again 
19529 4 Excellent! 
19530 4 Grip is very sturdy, and made if very nice material, it doesn t seem cheap at all. very happy with this purchase, would definitely buy again. 
19531 3 Fits perfectly 
19532 3 Charged the battery very fast but I haven t used the battery yet to see how it preforms. 
19533 1 Camera has difficulty focusing on small items, zoom is so-so. If I had to do it all over again I would shell out the extra money for a better point and shoot. 
19534 4 Works great only issue is getting connected to view it from my phone if i am not on the same network at my house. 
19535 4 Great camera, great for beginners but looks like you can go next level if you want to learn how to use all the bells and whistles. I managed to get it on sale for 300 which is a steal. 
19536 2 for the price its ok not stainless steal it rust within a day other than that it floats and holds go pro 4 very well in water i like that it has the screw hole on bottom thats why i went with this one 
19537 2 I just order for one.. then now after i reviced.. i found it double.. can i return? 
19538 4 I really do love this dual mount. Extremely affordable an great quality. 
19539 4 Great product. 
19540 4 Better than the one that came with the camera.I am very happy 
19541 3 For paying that price, It is good... 
19542 3 I loves me the X-T10, but it is small and not so easy to hold if you have large hands. This handgrip, while outrageously expensive, helps give a better grip. I wouldn t be without it. One star off for the price. 
19543 4 Excellent lens 
19544 4 Housing arrived exactly as described. Shipped and received promptly. Well made and good quality. No problems to 27m depth. See photos from Daymaniyat Islands in Oman attached. 
19545 4 I like that the hot shoe mount is on the handle to the side and not directly on top of gopro. I also like the foam grip. 
19546 4 This was purchased for my daughter for her DC trip. Takes great pics and very easy to use. After seeing the photos she took I want one for myself! 
19547 4 Good quality and good fit. Very satisfied 
19548 0 One of the batteries was defective or was not compatible with my Sony A77ii. The charger would not charge & stopped working a few days after initial use, & left me in a lurch work-wise. Would not recommend. 
19549 2 Does not fit Panasonic Lumix LX100 as some have claimed. Looks like a solid case otherwise. 
19550 3 Great option if your camera doesn t have a pre made version available. Nikon d5300 
19551 4 Great lens and probably the least I ll ever spend on a lens by far. Image quality is really nice can t believe this lens was so affordable. 
19552 4 Awesome accessory for my Olympus TG-4 
19553 3 Good 
19554 0 Flew for 5 minutes. No longer will lift of the ground. Don t waste your money.

19565 4 Fit perfectly on my D200. 
19566 0 It had a bad camera and it would barley fly outside and the controls were very difficult to control. 
19567 3 I like it. I just understood it had wifi. 
19568 4 Super solid tripod. Great deal for your money. It s a steal, really. Highly recommend to people looking for a high quality tripod in the sub-$150 range.

19576 2 They work, a bit more flimsy than one would prefer, but THEY WORK! 
19577 4 Nice wifi cams. I set them to record to my 3T external drive. Easy setup and a decent picture for the price. 
19578 4 good quality works great 
19579 2 It easily slips off but it s overall standard 
19580 4 Its a must have for the gopro! Easy to install and stays on through case removal after case removal. Must have!

19588 3 It s a bit small for an Iphone 6 plus 
19589 4 works great! 
19590 4 Works great a+++ 
19591 4 Fit right on the camera, good quality 
19592 1 The alarm is fine if that is all you want, but the &#34;chime&#34; setting is loud and harsh and blares in your customers ear as they walk through the door. 
19593 4 perfect to my d3200, good hand Grip and more power to shoot. 
19594 4 great. 
19595 3 nice to be able to charge 2 batteries at the same time. You have to wiggle the batteries a little sometimes to get them plugged in correctly 
19596 4 Exactly what I needed; arrived in great time for upcoming cruise. A handy device 
19597 4 Delivered what was described, quickly. 
19598 4 Works perfectly. 
19599 4 Excellent 
19600 4 Good for the price.

19602 4 my batteries seem to last forever when you can put two together. plus the grip is comfortable.

19606 4 I m very satisfied

19611 4 Nice 
19612 3 This works great lots of features, interchangeable lenses, 
19613 4 Love this! It works exactly as described and very easy to install and can be moved around the house as needed. 
19614 3 it worked cliffdiving from 40ft! with the string was longer though 
19615 3 good, but on the smaller side 
19616 3 I got what I expected, I can t complain? 
19617 1 The axis are too loose..never expect to be disappointed for this... 
19618 4 As expected! 
19619 2 Product just as advertised. Great merchant 
19620 4 good 
19621 0 Piece of junk. Simply does not work and instructions were for a completely different device. STAY AWAY FROM THIS ITEM. I filed a claim with Amazon and we will see what happens. I am not going to return to China. 
19622 4 Nice bag! 
19623 4 Velvia never disappoints. 
19624 4 great 
19625 4 Awesome product 
19626 1 cheap. but do the job. 
19627 4 The product is great and we have not had any problems with it. It was delivered ahead of scheduling and the packaging was well done. 
19628 4 It s Wasabi Power. Charger, batteries work great. Much less than the Panasonic batteries in cost. 
19629 1 With a go pro it s hard to balance this thing getting it to balance without moving is easy but keeping it balance while moving seems impossible but maybe it s just me lol 
19630 4 Great value and great quality lenses. I m shocked at how good it is. 
19631 4 Good replacement 
19632 4 Mounted it on the ceiling, it works well, nice pix. 
19633 4 Absolute must have to protect expensive lenses from impact damage.... 
19634 2 The card makes it worth while, but probably won t use most of the items. 
19635 3 So far so good. An improvement over previous models. Touch screen. Easier navigation through menu opens. Easier download to memory card and thus to editing. 
19636 3 One battery lasts my just under a year in my range finder, playing three times a week. 
19637 4 Worked great 
19638 4 love it. 
19639 2 Considerably over priced, I believe. 
19640 3 They seem to have worked great while being used on my first dives and first time use of the GoPro! 
19641 2 Stands are very weak and wobbly. Lenses are mediocre. 
19642 4 Nice camera! 
19643 4 Shipping was a little bit late, 4 days but that was on USPS not on the seller. Great lens great quality and not full price :) cant be happier. 
19644 0 The LCD screen did not work 
19645 4 Item was fairly priced-described just as I got it-shipped quickly-great purchase 
19646 4 as advertised. 
19647 4 I love this camera...easy to use and SHARP pictures. The quick video button is a newer feature and GREAT! This is my 4th cannon camera and I would not consider buying any other brand. Focus Camera bundles are great money savers. 
19648 3 I m always trying to find the right mount, screw, whatever for all the mounts for my GoPro. This gives me a little more to work with. Felt it was priced a little high for what I got, though. 
19649 0 bad panel. Hooked it up and just made clicks. don t buy 
19650 4 Fits my Canon 430 flash well; snaps right on and does not fall off. Great item at a good price. 
19651 4 Easy to install, great picture day or night. 
19652 4 This is an amazing lens. I took it out for a test drive and it blew my mind in reach, clarity and contrast. 
19653 4 The harness looks very well made. I am looking forward to giving the Geekpro and chest harness to my Grandson for his 14 th Birthday Nov 2nd. I will be happy to review it at that time. 
19654 4 Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for! 
19655 4 Great product. Fast shipping. Thank You. 
19656 4 Great product. 
19657 0 Waste of money. Terrible distortion. 
19658 3 Fantastic light or the price. Pretty well built stand too. I appreciate the fact that it has 5 switches so that I can get exactly the amount of light I want. I did drop one start though because one of the 5 bulbs was defective and did not work. 
19659 4 DJI battery what can I say, it works well. 
19660 4 perfect carrying case for the fujifilm instaxmini8 
19661 4 These have every look and feel of OEM GoPro mount clips. 
19662 3 The hprc case is amazing. Just what I expected. Heavy duty baby. The only reason I didn t give it 5 stars is the foam layout was different than the picture. I wasn t sure if I received the correct case or not. 
19663 1 Not a great camera. My fault should have read more on it. Too slow to take a second shot. 5 second delay. Quality not as good with final photo. 
19664 2 These batteries are okay. They drain too fast for me and don t put out as power as I think they should. 
19665 4 Greatest glasses cleaner out there 
19666 4 Perfect, and so much better than paying at a retail store. 
19667 3 Just received mine yesterday. It s very comfortable and light, which makes my Nikon seem lighter when I have it over my shoulders. I also like the color designs on this strap plus it s not expensive. I d recommend others buying this brand of camera neck strap. 
19668 4 Bought this to store/carry all parts for Sylvania 9-inch portable DVD players (2 screens). Both players fit along with all the cords, chargers, etc. and 2 DVDs. Perfect. 
19669 4 Works great! Plug it into my laptop and upload my photos quick. 
19670 3 It functions as advertised - price is right. 
19671 4 great product thank you 
19672 0 broke on 1st use 
19673 0 Bought 2 neither one works. Waste of money. 
19674 4 works well sofar 
19675 0 Poor product. The lens is so lousy it cuts your pictures. The camera is so poorly engineered that the film gets stuck. The film is so small. The old polaroid was perfect why did they have to change it ? 
19676 0 No good resolution 
19677 4 Works very well on my Nikon. Very comfortable. 
19678 4 Sensors work as expected and you get 5 of them at a nice price. 
19679 1 It was pretty great, until it broke after about a month of use. The attaching screw on the bottom snapped in half, so now I can t attach a monopod or anything of the sort to it, therefore rendering it pretty useless. I got what I paid for, I guess. 
19680 4 Love it...perfect for selfies. 
19681 4 works very good on my helmet and very pleased. Thanks!! 
19682 4 Great price for this one! It s a steal! 
19683 4 I really can t find a fault with this light. It is bright and the quality of light is good. It has barn doors, a remote and other accessories. This is a very good product. 
19684 3 Works as described, arrived on time and with no problems. I use it in my daily log and it s great. 
19685 3 Scope works great. The program is a bit skepitcal. 
19686 2 You get what you pay for. Replaced it after a year. 
19687 3 Nice! 
19688 4 great product. 
19689 4 Works perfect for my camera!! 
19690 4 worked great 
19691 0 Can t figure out how to use the stupid thing. Instructions are as poor as they come!! Wouldn t recommend it to anyone. 
19692 4 I Traded in my Canon 7D, which I never really enjoyed (it has since been discontinued), after purhasing this camera! I love this camera - the pictures look amazing! 
19693 4 It works well. It helps me stabilize the camera when I shoot. 
19694 0 Just purchased this and found it only fires at full power on manual and TTL is stuck on one power as well. Tested it on several attempts. Hoping this is just a fluke. 
19695 4 Very durable and sturdy strap 
19696 3 very reliable 
19697 3 Has come in pretty handy 
19698 4 Not made cheap this is a steardy tool I use it on gun range in windy days does more then I expected it be for $ thanks for the deal 
19699 4 Works perfectly. Definitely adds bulk, but worth it to only need to charge my daily-use camera once a month. 
19700 4 Works well. Just a tad off in color though. 
19701 4 Great Deal, Fine product, Five Stars***** 
19702 4 Amazing~! I love it. Holds really well on most surfaces--glass, body panels on a car, most flat surfaces. Grip is extra tight. Get this! End of the story. 
19703 0 did not work for the model it says it does 
19704 1 The aluminum material was too lightweight and the head was not fluid enough for my needs so I returned it. 
19705 4 It works perfectly for me. It gives that extra light that I need and having the shoebox gives it a softer and warmer affect. Very pleased. 
19706 4 Works extremely well and can be used with either eye by turning the eyecup. 
19707 4 Great inexpensive tripod bag does the job, was a bit small but I can not blame the bag for my tripod for being a few inches to big Good price good quality travels nicely 
19708 4 Good for mounting outside 
19709 3 Fits well into the camera. Would have liked a car solution as well, but that was not promised. 
19710 4 This is inexpensive and does a good job. 
19711 4 solid app. worth the price. Caught my dog turning on my gas oven.. No joke 
19712 4 Works great! 
19713 4 beautiful and good quality 
19714 4 This is a great accessory for hiking, or really any hands free activity. The hat clip is genius, I like to clip mine to a bandana. 
19715 4 Comfortable and stylish 
19716 4 Bought this for my new lens and it is awesome. Easy to fit. A great purchase! 
19717 4 survived my purpose and the price was right 
19718 4 Nikon is the best! 
19719 3 It could be a little bit louder and a little more vicious sounding but I think it works fine 
19720 4 This accessory kit is amazing! You have so many options of ways to film from your GoPro! 
19721 4 Very light weight and easy to use. Takes great photos. Purchased for my wife and she prefers it to her Iphone. 
19722 4 A good product. Fast battery charging. Displays information accurately. Battery is compatible with fujifilm xp80. 
19723 4 I am satisfied with device and the product support. AR004218 was very supportive at DLink. 
19724 4 using it with the sony rx1r. Does the job even though a bit overpriced. 
19725 2 Having problems with some of the futures to my camera when the battery pack is connected. As for the power supply it works great. 
19726 3 Great handle for a gopro 
19727 4 great 
19728 0 Was not a Honeywell part, rather a generic off-brand replacement. Does work, but not what I thought I was buying. 
19729 4 Awesome 
19730 3 Pretty good protection and pricing, however it s a bit hard to take my Xiaomi Yi Camera out of it. The camera kind of gets stuck inside. I still use it daily though since I have bunch of goPro accessories to use between this and my Hero4 Silver. 
19731 4 Thank you, arrived as stated. 
19732 4 Nice color, nice design, durable fabric 
19733 4 Remote shutter release. Works as promised. There are cheaper alternatives out there, but I had two cheaper ones that stopped working after a while. 
19734 0 Could not get a clear picture Returned 
19735 4 Perfect! 
19736 4 This seller is fantastic! They have excellent customer service and their prices and products are great! I am a very satisfied repeat customer! 
19737 3 Great for most situations, It would have been perfect if it had a 180 degree rotation so that it can be bounced of side walls. 
19738 3 Arrived quickly and works as it should. Instruction aren t very good but YouTube can help you with that. 
19739 4 Great product and works really well. I use it as my outdoor cam without any issues. 
19740 4 Perfect! 
19741 3 Inexpensive and good quality. Will likely upgrade to higher wattage bulbs, though stands and umbrellas are great. Good customer service as well...they send-out replacement for broken bulb immediately. 
19742 4 Great little action camera. Well worth the price. 
19743 4 good quality everyday backpack. comfort, style, alot of pockets. 
19744 4 Camera case was great recommend this if you have move video Camera 
19745 4 Perfect an fast delivery 
19746 3 Great lens on a 5DsR. 
19747 4 Perfect 
19748 4 Ignore the negative reviews! I got this to see what my puppy is doing in the when given new freedom. Setting up the internet connection is not easy but following the directions closely will work. Very awesome! 
19749 4 Good communication and quick shipping. Excellent product-much better than expected. Does not leave filmy streaks like the others I ve tried, they disappear immediately and you don t need to go over your screen again. Can be reused several times. Great on cell phone screens, Ipad, Ipod, etc..Highly recommend 
19750 4 Item arrived as described. Quick ship. Highly recommend! 
19751 0 Don t use it 
19752 4 Great camera. My daughter loves it! 
19753 4 Made of metal so it s more resilient and can hold up to a lot of use. Threads seem to line up nicely and go on without a fight. 
19754 2 Great value brought for a present the individual didn t want it. 
19755 3 Took it to Europe buy plane and train, came back and it s like new. 
19756 4 Danny at Foscam helped me with the port forwarding so I could view the cameras on my mobile device while away from home. He was fast, easy tho understand and professional. 
19757 4 This is a standard UV filter. It appears to be performing just fine, OK combination of price and performance. 
19758 2 Eh worth about what it costs 
19759 4 This was a gift to complement my daughter s 10th bday gift. It was a perfect fit and she loves all the extras. She has not yet tried the selfie adaptation but the rest I would recommend. The delivery was extra fast which was a great plus in my book. 
19760 4 Works great! Simple to use, paired easily with my S5. Much better selfie, and will use this a lot for event pics. Compact size fits in purse. 
19761 3 The device is pretty good, does it s job, nothing special about it, the clicking sound is a bit annoying but otherwise it s ok to know if it s still moving or not. https://youtu.be/yoQnYusGtPo 
19762 4 Great case. Fits camera like a glove. Leather and stitching excellent. Even ithough it was shipped form China, I got it in less than 2 weeks 
19763 0 bad 
19764 4 So many tripods to choose from, why not just get one from Amazon? I couldn t be happier! Tripod has very sturdy build, can be set to any height you desire, and any of the adjustments will stay tight wherever you put them. 
19765 4 Fits well. As advertised. 
19766 2 Hard to get camera in and out of case 
19767 3 Super easy to install and great picture. 
19768 4 small - compact - safe - wellmade 
19769 4 got this as a gift 
19770 4 perfect for what I wanted...holds plenty but isn t too bulky....very comfortable 
19771 4 this item is designed very well and installed pretty easy 
19772 0 They send me a completely wrong battery in a A640PX box. Don t buy this if you re looking for this battery! Very dissapointed. 
19773 4 It was nice to have these extra battery packs for my honeymoon! Worked wonderfully and would recommend to anyone! 
19774 4 love it 
19775 4 This is one of the best monitor we have worked with so far. Super easy useful interface, very well thought design, light weight, luts via SD card insert. It is worth every penny. Big respect for SmallHD to put such a product. 
19776 3 not bad 
19777 4 All the items in the picture arrived. I didn t test all yet, but at least looks good and work. 
19778 4 Been waiting for this truly wireless video security solution for a long time. It works exactly as I d hoped. I recommend this system to everyone that will listen. Go ahead and pass Go. 
19779 0 not a dvr 
19780 3 I haven t used it that much yet. Still learning. But so far everything Seems to be working just fine. 
19781 4 Beyond happy with the purchase might be expensive but well worth every penny, I had a phantom fc40 before but this well surpasses every phantom so far in every way, well imo it does the inspire was to expensive 
19782 2 typical 
19783 4 Perfect, works as intended 
19784 4 Really like having lens clip holder on my camera strap. I don t always take my camera bag or have pockets to put lens cap in. This solves that problem! 
19785 4 Love it. 
19786 3 Got this for my wife who s an amateur photographer. The kit comes with everything you need for a quick and easy lighting boost. From making home videos to shooting scenes outdoors, it works great. The price was excellent and gives you a lot for the money. 
19787 1 Took small tumble to the side and these cracked without even protecting the props. Chipped a prop and completely broke off a guard. Cheap pieces of s***. Very light though 
19788 4 Works perfectly as described. Anyone with a DSLR should have one of these (really though, they should just come with the camera...) 
19789 4 As addvertized 
19790 2 excellent item, solved my problem 
19791 4 Wonderful camera! Got it for my 10-year-old daughter for her birthday and it s her favorite gift! Love it! 
19792 4 Holds camera, USB cord and batteries fine. Less expensive than similar cases offered by camera manufacturers. 
19793 1 Does t put out much Ir light. the video camera has some IR led s and I see no improvment when I add this for extra light. 
19794 4 Great deal and excellent product for our purpose. 
19795 1 Perfect fit for my DSLR but the sting broke within a couple months of use :( 
19796 3 Fast shipping looks good works awesome battery doesn t last long do wich sucks connects to any smartphone doesn t have a motorcycle helmet attachments only for bike helmet wich sucks but other than that it s awesome 
19797 0 never worked peace of crap 
19798 2 it s hard to remote this DVR. 
19799 4 Great lightweight tripod. 
19800 4 Love this to turn any purse into a camera bag. I took it on a trip to Prague and it was perfect! I had a canon rebel t3i and batteries, Chargers, etc with plenty of room. 
19801 0 Just bought this product and two cameras don t work at all Who do I send this back to ??? Amazon or zmodo 
19802 2 doesn t really fit the rx100-3 but is fine on my rx100 
19803 4 Works great with my Sony camera! 
19804 4 Not sure why people say it was stiff? It s probably the softest strap I ve ever felt. The next best strap would be an Artisan and Artist silk strap, but they re way more expensive. 
19805 4 Loud enough ! Works great ! Sensor is super accurate ! 
19806 4 Very nice monopod. The carbon fiber is very strong and this thing can take a load. Very impressed with the fit and finish of this item. Benro makes a Quality piece. 
19807 2 An extra battery is always nice to have on hand and if it is already mounted, even better. The grip works just great, but the remote is another story. I have followed the the directions and can not get it to work. 
19808 4 Great little shoulder rig for the price. Used it yesterday on a shoot and did the job perfectly. 
19809 3 Works great as expected. A goodvalue 
19810 3 A great alternative to using the one by Nikon, cost effective and sturdy, no issues works great. 
19811 4 Item performed great on our recent trip. Item delivered on time. Batteries charged & worked right out of the box. Very convenient on trips. Will order another set. 
19812 4 Love it. 
19813 2 Purchased for the tamron 150x600. VERY tight fit. Not ideal for this lens 
19814 4 Great 
19815 4 love it 
19816 2 when you turn the camera , I realized that in the configuration the WiFi option is not listed, this camera brings wifi? Help me configure the wifi 
19817 4 Works great 
19818 4 Came exactly as described. Works great with my GoPro Hero. 
19819 3 Clarity is good. A little too sensitive at night - even after adjustment. 
19820 2 Works great with my lumix. Would have loved an extra pocket for a extra sd card. 
19821 4 fits very well!! would buy again 
19822 3 Good as it is Nikon s. 
19823 4 I will give them a 6 Star if I could. It does not matter where I am I can see my pet. Great colors. Delivered on time and does everything the sellers says it suppose to do. 
19824 0 Not worth the money. The battery cannot be changed. Picture quality was bad. Returned it. 
19825 4 Wonderful 
19826 4 This is a great case. Fair price, keeps my expensive Nikon 5200 safe and snug. Plenty of pouches for other things, batteries, chargers, SD cards, etc. Highly recommend. Good quality. 
19827 3 Excelent for the price, but don t expect durability. 
19828 4 I installed this button camera on my clothes with a mini DVR, it looks very good, and no one knows this is a camera. Like it. 
19829 4 Just what I needed. Very White cloth. Very portable. 
19830 4 Great product at a great price! 
19831 3 Works well. 
19832 1 It s was just could meet d expectations 
19833 2 The action pack is a better deal. Wish I had waited. 
19834 4 Item does well jobs as described. Thanks. 
19835 4 just what I was looking for. 
19836 4 Good product 
19837 4 Very useful and great. 
19838 0 Half of the pictures would develop and the other half never turned out. Waste of money. 
19839 4 Thank you 
19840 4 As with everything Phantom 3 it s tough, durable and beautifully engineered and constructed. 
19841 4 Exactly as described and just what I needed to round out my Nikon d3200. :) 
19842 4 this backpack fits everything and I take it everywhere. I especially liked it it has straps that can hold my tripod on one side and the stabilizer on the other. There also pockets for all your little accessories including ST cards. It is also made of really really good quality. 
19843 0 This item was a waste of my money. It never worked right out of the box. The instructions were not in English and it went downhill from there. 
19844 4 1 
19845 4 Good quality and good price. Very satisfied. 
19846 0 The description says &#34;Which Has The 18-55mm Lens&#34;... Lens cap (Polaroid) says right on it: 52mm. It does not fit a 55mm lens. Not the first complaint about this...but they still do not change the description. 
19847 4 Perfect for my telescope needs 
19848 3 The camera is that easy, or you can do it all manually. I love my new camera, and I am learning how to take a better quality picture with all the different options. 
19849 4 Perfect for the basics, holds camera extra lens, batteries and filters 
19850 0 Quit working after 2 weeks. 2 did the same thing don t buy. 
19851 4 Works great! 
19852 4 Works well, seems to be pretty steady and sturdy. 
19853 4 Saved me $90 from having to take it in to my local camera shop and clean dust off the sensor. Thanks! 
19854 4 Excellent product just as advertised. Well built solid. Only complaint Is view finder must be at a angle when opening or it hits the top of cage. Arrived 2 weeks early love that. 
19855 4 Great camera at a great price 
19856 3 Seems to be a nice bag just what I was looking for good size and movable dividers inside on Velcro 
19857 3 Good photos and video quality with shown mounts. Good for basic and occasional usage. L 
19858 4 Nice to be able to use my old lens again. 
19859 4 It fits perfectly with my requirements I even use it for my underwater photography. 
19860 3 Was spectacle at first, but they did the job as expected. Glad I brought these diving goggles!!! 
19861 4 Well done, I Like 
19862 3 Seems to be very solid quality 
19863 4 Works as advertised, no complaints. 
19864 4 Perfect camera for our kids works great easy to use. 
19865 3 Perfect 
19866 4 Items work great. Perfect description. FSt delivery. Great price. Over alll excellent transaction 
19867 4 It works well for my purposes. The app is easy to use. Replacement cameras are not too expensive 
19868 4 Nice camera. I ve made many a picture and memory with this camera. 
19869 4 Love it amazing 
19870 4 good deal! 
19871 2 Love this lens. First copy had front element fall out of it, as it was only secured by glue. Had to buy a second copy, but image quality and usability is great. 
19872 1 Haha good junk camera! 
19873 4 Fits my T5i like a glove 
19874 4 Great illumination from this. Saved from replacing a camera in which the IR died. Can now use at night without issue. 
19875 4 it did what i wanted 
19876 3 really good heavy duty camera... its a pain to adjust you need allen wrenches but other than that its a great camera 
19877 2 Too small for anything! 
19878 4 This is a great bag at the price I was looking for. I like that I can put my laptop in it, but it does make things cozy for my fat camera. I d buy this again. 
19879 4 perfect for capturing about 2 hrs of video 
19880 1 Saw the stand broken upon opening the box. I had wished to place the unit on a table but as a result of the broken stand had to screw it to the wall. 
19881 3 Floats phone in water and with a waterproof case. Fits great on any size wrist, even kids and stays on wrist. 
19882 4 This is a decent mic for the money and I have no complaints 
19883 3 Great product, just wish the cable was a little longer but not a deal breaker. 
19884 0 Didn t come with the 8GB card and had to send back. 
19885 4 Fits my T5i and extra batteries. Great for anyone who films. Also fits in another bag so you don t look sus with a camera everywhere. 
19886 4 Yes this is very good, easy release or attach for camera with help of ball release 
19887 4 Awesome product it is great for the price and works really well. 
19888 4 Actualy works 
19889 4 Value formoney 
19890 4 As expected. Very satisfied with the product. 
19891 4 Easy to use! 
19892 4 A most have for go pro owner, the go pro battery only last 2 hours max so it good to carry few back ups just in case. i have 4 of these because i go out on long hikes 
19893 4 Works great! 
19894 4 This camera was the perfect replacement for our parking area 
19895 3 It s a great looking strap, it s not that comfortable but what to be expected. It look beautiful with my film camera. 
19896 4 Great camera, easy to use. feels good, great pictures. 
19897 4 Love the camera, easy to use and great pictures 
19898 4 So far have had good signal strength with my fatshark goggles. Definitely needs power filtering, without filtering I was getting all kinds of horizontal white lines. I tossed in a cheap UBEC and then it went perfectly clear. Range tests coming soon! 
19899 3 Met my needs. 
19900 4 These cameras work very well. They were easy to setup and once they were setup I was able to go wireless. Work great with my Android phone. Looks like a good design and seem very durable. Try one or two like I did. 
19901 3 I like it overall, not always the best quality in low light 
19902 4 Very high quality battery for GoPro Hero 4 Black ed. Just like OEM battery from GoPro. Worth every cent. 
19903 4 Great product 
19904 4 I just received my set. I m now going to purchase units for ALL of my lenses. It s a great investment. I have noticed some vignetting when mounted on my 16-35mm f/4. That one might be returned. The 24-70mm 2/8 seems fine. 
19905 4 Did the job just right for what I wanted to do. I clipped it to a Garmin bean bag mount. 
19906 4 Great product. strong/sturdy/nice case/well made 
19907 4 Excellent!!! Great price. Prompt service 
19908 0 will not record for me! 
19909 0 I got mine.. And after one day it refuse to turn on.. I charged the battery but still isn t working.. Planning for a refund! 
19910 4 Fast delivery, product as described. Would do biz, again. LOVE this monopod! 
19911 4 Fit well, easy to install 
19912 3 Generally good, but i m in the bushes and trees a lot. The adhesive that attaches the strap to the lens cap is not good enough for me. 
19913 4 Excellent tri pod. I use it for my spotting scope. Light weight and fits in my backpack. 
19914 4 Okay. 
19915 4 Wish the camera came with this, works like it is part of camera! 
19916 4 This accessory kit fits my canon camera prefect. It is a great accessory to have to protect the len. 
19917 4 Super 
19918 4 Easy to work. Good quality. 
19919 4 great 
19920 4 Great camera, clear pictures with vivid colors. Like the long range zoom 
19921 4 purchased this pristine camera with battery grip, magnifier eyepiece, sigma flash. Well-pleased with everything i have used so far; have not used flash. Shutter count was low 1500. Seller answered all my questions to my satisfaction and i recommend this seller. 
19922 0 Not a very good replacement for the Panasonic branded battery. Short life, very fast rolloff of power at end. Wouldn t recommend, wouldn t purchase again. 
19923 4 Connects very quickly with other Yongnuo and Canon products. 
19924 4 Exactly what i was looking for. I use it a lot. 
19925 4 So light and worked perfectly on my rafting trip! Fit nicely on my helmet! 
19926 4 Everything fine, useful as expected & good delivery service... 
19927 4 The D750 camera is everything Nikon says it is. 
19928 4 Received in a timely manner and as advertised. Haven t utilized all of them yet but they do fit well on the adapter ring for my PowerShot. Thanks. 
19929 4 Another perfect fit for my studio from the good folks at Cowboy Studios. 
19930 4 Does what its supposed to. Easy to install. I recommend using a UV filter along with this to protect the exposed contacts on the back of the lens... the adapter has the treading for the filter so its perfect. 
19931 2 Good strap, but has a tendency to want to twist around & the placed side ended up facing out. 
19932 3 Nice camera for the price! 
19933 2 little poor quality zipper 
19934 4 I carry a Sony DSLR camera and several attachments in it. Not a lot of extra room, but enough. 
19935 2 Concept s OK but battery does not really last long. I used it few times but battery does not last +2 hours albeit I charge it full when I first got it. Not sure if I got a bad unit. 
19936 4 Great stuff for great price though the step up has wifi 
19937 4 Perfect fit, was a replacement for the one I lost. 
19938 4 So when I ordered these, I though they where air cushioned, they are not they are spring, however, they are 100% metal and I have no fear of the clamps letting go on them... They would be 6 stars I hey where also air cushioned 
19939 3 MORE THAN ENOUGH WIRE SERVED ITS PURPOSE GOOD BUY 
19940 4 Very easy set up. Quality of camera s is good during day and night. Able to view from smartphone with ease. I like being able to monitor my home while I am at work. 
19941 4 Very pleased with the camera. The instructions for the WiFi connection are sorely lacking. Fortunately Nikon was able to walk me through the procedure. 
19942 4 Great!!! 
19943 3 The lenses are a little smaller than I was expecting. But other than that they re really nice. Fit well and do not fog up at all. The zebra lenses are great from driving in bright sun to biking through shaded trails. 
19944 2 too big 
19945 4 I wear reading glasses and this help me see what I am taking pictures of without them. 
19946 4 Love this camera bag. Is the pecfect size, compact, not to big. My Canon EOS Rebel T6i with a 18-135mm lens fits perfectly! 
19947 0 Display is barely readable after only a few weeks of operation. Logitech has lost their hold on the WiLife market. 
19948 4 Exactly what we needed 
19949 4 These &#34;bags&#34; provide great protection for my Canon lenses. I keep a small Canon Vixia video camera in the largest bag. 
19950 3 Great Camera, for the price picture resolution a lot better than my cam s that came with my DVR. Im going to replace my other two cameras... 
19951 4 great 
19952 4 So far, so good. Haven t taken it into the water yet...we ll see what the second half of this review looks like... 
19953 4 Awesome for the money. Be sure to use 720p (60FPS) when shooting fast paced footage 
19954 0 waste of money!!! Not happy at all. very bad quality. 
19955 4 The NEST cam is wonderful but......The website to view the recordable is far far less than apealing to use in comparison to the dropcam website. The drop cam website had this ease of use whereas the nest website is slow and has a lot of bugs. Mainly slow...... 
19956 4 Works just fine 
19957 4 amazing 
19958 4 I bought this camera for my recent vacation. I had it in the water with me on several occasions. This camera is excellent for the price. I love the selfie function too. Overall I m very happy with this purchase! 
19959 4 Great deal!!! 
19960 4 is working real good. 
19961 4 Expensive but worth, my daughter love it and have so much fum taking pics with her friends! Received it quickly and well package. 
19962 0 I could not get the camera to charge, so I returned it. 
19963 4 So easy to set up and use. It s very practical. The Nest Cam gives us peace of mind when we re away from home. 
19964 4 as described. Thanks! 
19965 3 simple to use, excellent starter camera set for my friend s 14 year old daughter 
19966 3 Pretty cool toy, Easy to fly and best value! 
19967 2 Just Okay, Rarly use it due to its flimsy nature. Don t be fooled by it s rugged appearance. The part that turns is loose and never is really stable. Good for hanging a small LED light. 
19968 4 I wanted to tell you how pleased i was with the way my order was handled. It arrived earlier thank expected and the product was just as described. The customer service was \\ top notch\\ thank you 
19969 3 Great value pack for the price can t beat it batteries last longer than I thought they were gonna too 
19970 4 I never regret buying this. Great product by a great company which I have known since I was about 4 or 5 years old (in 1995 I guess) 
19971 2 They work, but was hoping they d be a little longer on the handle side. Probably would not buy again. 
19972 4 Works great! Good for placing plants in your house that have certain light requirements. 
19973 4 Great product for the price!! 
19974 4 This screen protector fits my Canon 5D iii with amazing precision and clarity. DEFINITELY an A+ 
19975 3 It works very well but the lens cap is very hard to take on and off. 
19976 4 Great bag, well padded and just the right amount of storage for day to day use. 
19977 4 Awesome product 
19978 4 LOVE the zoom.... really great so far. 
19979 4 Works Just fine. Would recommend 
19980 0 Not as listed and had white screen P O S!!!!!!! 
19981 0 Upon arrival, the rubber part came 75% off from the hard plastic frame that slips over the bracket. This was why I bought a replacement, as my original one had finally pulled apart after three years. The replacement was useless. 
19982 4 I like my tripod a lot. It s everything I needed. 
19983 2 A little cheezy for the price, but interesting to experiment with. 
19984 4 Great price and quality 
19985 3 Recommended, but slightly pricey. 
19986 4 Very good. Worked well. I have the door open at my store and need it something to let me know when someone enter. 
19987 2 Could be a little more sturdy 
19988 3 One of the batteries failed after one month. The camera simply doesn t register that it s there anymore. The other works just as well as my Sony battery. I average about 400-500 shots per battery, but I have airplane mode turned on and auto-focus off (Sony a7ii). 
19989 1 This step up filter adaptor is made aluminum instead of brass, so it has a tendency to bind. 
19990 4 My husband has not complained at all! 
19991 4 Great for what I need, not a professional, but works fine. 
19992 4 Great fit! 
19993 4 THE BEST AND SLICK LOOKING 
19994 4 I ve been using this everything has been great 
19995 4 Good product, have used it a lot. 
19996 4 LOVE THESE!!! Easy setup and install. Great quality product and super clean HD picture, both IR night vision and daylight. Very happy with these. 
19997 4 No problems. Got exactly what I ordered. 
19998 0 This Battery delivered a full 100% charge for the 1st few months, then dropped down to achieving only a maximum of a 50% charge... This is unacceptable as now I can no longer rely on it being a backup for my camera due to limited capacity... 
19999 4 Love it 
20000 4 Really easy to set up, you can do so with just your smart phone, some knowledge of networks/routers helps do the advanced features. 
20001 4 Best security camera there is. Motion activated, everything is recorded on SD card, but could be connected to wifi and be monitored remotely. 
20002 4 I picked this up as a spare for my 2015 Yamaha V1 Waverunner. It is is comfortable and seems to be a much better quality than the one that came with my unit. This has replaced the original as my primary lanyard. 
20003 3 Easy to handle, frame picture and carry around. 
20004 4 Great price, works well, will buy from this vendor again 
20005 4 fast shipping and good product. all mentioned item complete and works perfectly. 
20006 4 Very cool if you love science!! 
20007 4 Nikon !!!! no need to say more. 
20008 2 I liked the product but it took a long time to arrive. 
20009 4 Excellent price and works great 
20010 4 Amazing value for the price. Very high quality. If i dropped these in the ocean I would go out and buy another pair that day. 
20011 4 wonderful item, fast shipping, love them! 
20012 4 Great additional lens for my Nikon camera...great price..delivered quickly. .would buy again or recommend ! 
20013 3 I don t use it very often but it does the job. 
20014 0 The camera box arrived with a hole in the side and the camera has two chips in the paint plus small surface scratches on the face side at the shutter area. Beware on this camera. Not happy at all. 
20015 4 Love that it syncs my photos with my cloud storage. 
20016 4 WORKS AS INTENDED 
20017 2 ok 
20018 4 I HATE harsh flash effects. This will soften everything regardless of the angle of the head. Yes. it reduces effective range, but that is what software is for. 
20019 1 They were not bright enough 
20020 3 So far so good. I sold my Nikon DSLR for this and everything seems to be good. Image quality and zoom are amazing. It also has very good stabilization in the videos. 
20021 3 Very good accept for the sound. 
20022 1 had to use tin foil to make them work correctly 
20023 3 Best sandals (flip flops) I ve ever owned. However, a bit pricey. 
20024 4 The battery charger works well and SterlingTek was terrific to work with. 
20025 3 Be aware one of the items screws on counter clockwise. I returned one unit as I thought the threading was broken. 
20026 3 works good. stores easily 
20027 4 Excellent package at this price. The screw on lenses are marginal at best. The camera and zooms, however, are excellent. 
20028 4 vERY VERY GOOD!! 
20029 4 Really strong, used it on rugged trails for months now 
20030 4 Great product. Just what i needed. I have only used it for a day, but it feels well manufactured and durable. 
20031 2 Rigth rear motor (rear black propeler) does nt run fast enougth 
20032 4 Great Mic for the buck. Can t go wrong. 
20033 4 Adjustable, comfortable, and because of the rubber lines on the inside, it doesn t slip. Great! 
20034 4 Does what it says it would. 
20035 4 So far I love this lens. Nothing bad to say at all 
20036 4 I thought this would be tricky to assemble and not be sturdy enough to meet my needs, but it affixed to the lens and gives me the needed surge of handling zooming, focusing, and reading the screen with ease! 
20037 4 Great case, you can adjust it to fit any of your accessories. The camera with underwater case fits perfectly. Compact but very roomy for all your needs. 
20038 3 Woks well and is relatively easy to setup and fly... however, the lack of rotor guards is a big minus, as they break very easily (the Phantom has optional rotor guards that protect it from breaking when accidentally hitting objects like trees). 
20039 4 I am super duper SUPER happy with this seller. The lens is beyond perfection and I would think it was brand new unused if someone asked me. I would use this seller again and again! 
20040 3 A good camera strap to have. 
20041 4 Excellent 
20042 2 Not bad. Well constructed but the inner detachable walls in the main pouch don t really line up perfectly anywhere. Pretty awkward to organize. 
20043 4 a little bulky but work well 
20044 4 This works great for my gaming lighting set up. Small and portable. Great buy!! 
20045 4 Perfect for home studio. Great value, easy to set up, and seems to be sturdy. 
20046 4 I had the opportunity to use it in a recent trip to Cancún. It worked out great to give me the contrast I needed on different lighting situations. Definitely makes the editing process easier in Lightroom. I loved the final results. 
20047 0 Buyer beware you will Not receive what is pictured. You will get a totally different clamp that will Not work with the 2000 series meters. 
20048 3 It s working good 
20049 4 Great product. 
20050 0 I received this defective product with audio failed. This product can not use for car recorder due to the Polariod mount design limitation. 
20051 4 This is my first pelican and It definitely stands up to its reputation. Shipped faster than estimated delivery, made it to Illinois in 2 days. I might have to get a second one. 
20052 4 works great 
20053 4 alright 
20054 3 fine 
20055 4 Snapped on P-tap of V-lock battery with positive pressure. Repurposed this cable to feed 14.4 volts to my Sound Devices. Solid soldering and good contacts. Will buy again. 
20056 4 This is the perfect replacement/additional battery that we have been looking for. Excellent quality product - Highly recommended! 
20057 4 This accessory is cute and fun. The case gives the camera a little flare. My daughter loves the stickers. 
20058 4 THE BEST! 
20059 0 I had to return two of these, both had a defective leg clamp. Never had a problem with Manfrotto gear before but the same problem twice in a row is too much to ignore. Going to try something different. 
20060 4 My dog tested it by trying to come through the glass door and it set off the alarm. Good to know it works :) 
20061 4 Great little widget. It has 1/4 20 tapped holes on its length too but due to angle of bracket I don t see them providing any use except making it lighter. But it does exactly what I needed it to do. 
20062 4 I am very pleased with my new P600 and also with all of the goodies that came with the camera. The camera has more features then I will ever use but I am having fun trying them all out. 
20063 1 For less than 5 bucks I didn t expect much, but the overly strong smell of the rubber used to make this, makes me nauseous. Item functions great of you can get around the excessively strong rubber smell. 
20064 0 Badly directional and doesn t work from very far away. Never used it successfully. 
20065 4 Great for DIY instead of lefting a pro to fix for you. 
20066 3 I use this quite a lot. works well.... 
20067 4 Great zoom lens. Autofocus is perfect. Great for action shots at the baseball games. 
20068 4 Delivers even before expected... Can t wait to test it ! 
20069 0 Don t waste your money. None of the buttons are marked making it hard to remember which button is which. 
20070 4 great camera 
20071 4 Very pleased with this product. 
20072 2 Had to return for refund as one of the speakers wouldn t work, video is not very smooth and kept locking up on playback. Great concept that needs refining. 
20073 3 came as expected. the battery works fine. 
20074 1 low quality, died during the 1st serious session done with it. you get what you pay for :( 
20075 3 Great Product 
20076 4 Work great slide on to rails with ease 
20077 4 Good product and great performance. 
20078 3 Good quality for the price. 
20079 4 aok 
20080 4 This quality leather camera case was delivered exactly according to the description plus the unmentioned fasteners are also of good quality. The case fits my Nikon D5500 perfectly and I am pleased to recommend it. 
20081 3 Worked pretty well for looking in the cylinders of my old John Deere. Needed the mirrors to do 90deg that it does not come with. 
20082 3 Excellent deal! More stuff than I can use right now, but looking forward to learning about this amazing camera. Bag is not big enough to hold all items!!! 
20083 4 Arrived on time, and works as expected. 
20084 4 Very good product. 
20085 3 Not typically a fan of of brand products but how could you say no for the value. 4 batteries, a charger, a mini tripod and more for under $20. What a steal!! Batteries have worked fine so far. 
20086 4 still using it 3 years later 
20087 0 App wouldn t work for the people we gave it to. I plan to return it :( 
20088 4 Works as it should to be. 
20089 4 Purchased as a gift for someone in surveillance work. They love the lighter weight and clear focus of this choice out of the dozens to choose from. 
20090 4 Great case for carrying the mini monitor and some extras 
20091 0 The clip that keeps the case together broke within a week of me using it. 
20092 3 I m spoiled by a Canon XS50, but the peace of mind of having an inexpensive camera that water can t damage when kayaking is worth what I miss in control and image of photo. The photos are better than I expected and it s waterproof! 
20093 3 Keeps camera protected, perfect fit. 
20094 4 Love this! They all work wonderfully! I love to vlog and these help tremendously as it gives a wide view. 
20095 4 product worked as intended. 
20096 4 I bought this to go with my range scope since it has a canted eye piece. I can adjust this mount to hold the scope sideways and don t have to strain my neck to see perfectly. It s very stable on the ground. Love it. 
20097 4 Great! 
20098 3 Great set up. I wish it came with an owner s manual. I had to download the pdf version, which I can t carry with me when I m out in the world taking photos. But it comes with everything else I need, and takes great photos. 
20099 2 Tripod was damage. Delivery was fast 
20100 4 Good Product Works as expected 
20101 2 It s ok 
20102 4 it must have cost more to make this than I paid for it 
20103 3 Still learning all the stuff this camera is capable of.. Way more than I am.. Somewhat confusing menu system but hopefully I will learn.. Seems like good value for cost.. Excellent Leica Lens.. The long telephoto and great stabilization are real pluses.. 
20104 3 Nice Fit for my new Hero 4 Silver! 
20105 4 My mom bought this for me for my birthday and I love it! It takes great pictures and it is basically the talk of a party. Film is kind of expensive but it is reasonable. Love it! 
20106 4 Works great! 
20107 4 Convenient and easy to use! Great product!! 
20108 4 This little guy is like a tank. Very sturdy and functional for the price. 
20109 2 Good camera. Small size. 
20110 4 great 
20111 4 Works flawlessly on my X100T - no quality loss, no fringing, no autofocus struggles. Love how versatile it s made my favorite camera!!! 
20112 4 Item delivered on time and as described. 
20113 4 very good for watching baby room meanwhile we are away from home 
20114 4 It works well on lens and glass cleaning. 
20115 4 works very well 
20116 4 Battery on the gopro sucks so I had to buy this thing. 
20117 1 One battery worked, the other looked like it was charging, but never held a charge. If you can find OEM replacements, go with them if possible. 
20118 4 This thing is great 
20119 3 It is well made and sturdy. The zippers work well and does not snag. It exceeded my expectations. However, once a DSLR camera and the extra lens is in there, it gets quite bulky. 
20120 4 In love with my new camera! For the camera, the batteries, the pouch, AND the film, it was such a great price. Worked just like how I expected it would 
20121 4 Bought as a present for our son and his wife who moved over to USA with pet poodles, allows us to have a look at what they re up to anytime in perfect picture quality and sound. Can even talk to them if we wanted to. 
20122 4 This little cam is awesome! It is packed with features. And it works very well. I have compared it to a few different gopro and I will say that it s comparable on several levels! And only a fraction of the cost!! 
20123 4 very good combo 
20124 3 Great price for TWO batteries and a charger! The charger can be used in a standard US outlet or European outlet (with adapter). The car charger cord is a great addition! 
20125 4 We love it! 
20126 4 Very nice quality for the price! I was surprised at how nice it was! 
20127 4 A+ 
20128 3 It is pretty large and noticeable when mounted. It works well, easy to assemble and mount. Wish the angle was wider but for the most part it s a good item. 
20129 4 Came as advertised. Works perfect with my hero4 silver. 
20130 3 camera shots are not as clear as id expected 
20131 4 good deal! 
20132 4 Great 
20133 4 THIS WAS A VERY VERY GOOD + GREAT BUY!! I WAS SOOO RELIEVED TO SEE THIS AVAILABLE BECAUSE I RECENTLY THREW A BIG GRADUATION PARTY, AND HAD A DIY PHOTOBOOTH SET-UP, SO I REALLY REALLY NEEDED THIS FILM TO WORK, AND IT ALL TURNED OUT BEAUTIFULLY!! WAS A COMPLETE HIT!!! 
20134 4 Excelent and original product!!!. Matches perfectly in the LCD of my Alpha 77 II at the first application on it!... Five Stars!!!! 
20135 1 Lens fogged over after first rain. Get what you pay for !!!! Dont buy used !!!!! 
20136 4 Thank you very much. My lens filter arrived quickly and I m quite satisfied. 
20137 4 This is a great camera for those wanting more than just a mobile device snapshot. 
20138 4 good stuff 
20139 2 The strap is comfortable but the way it attaches to the camera did not seem secure to me. I wound up sewing it to make sure it did not become unattached. Still a good value though. 
20140 4 Smooth Transaction! Excellent Product!! A+++ 
20141 4 As advertised and they even put a signed letter in there thanking us for our purchase. Very classy and great customer service. Highly recommend!!! 
20142 4 Great product, very useful. Does not flote. 
20143 4 I really enjoy it! 
20144 4 Works and fits perfectly for my camera. Fast delivery! 
20145 4 Wonderful. Nikon D610w50mm + Two extra lens + Battery Charger + Remote + small flashlight + phone + u see it is quite versatile. 
20146 4 great 
20147 4 Worked well right out of the box 
20148 4 Product appears well made. I will be performing accuracy test on the product for proper alignment of laser during culmination. I will update review to five stars if test proves positive. Good package and shipped quickly. Thanks VITE has been working as it should. Very nice product. 
20149 4 We purchased this as a back up for our camera and choose the Canon as that is what our camera called for also we read some reviews for the knock offs which may not serve as well. 
20150 3 workds great thats why i got 4 
20151 4 PERFECT. this lil guy is awesome. i didnt need/want anything fancy....just needed something to hold up my camera that didnt cost $40+! 
20152 4 These work real well as you can use any wire for your security cameras with this set. 
20153 2 A few of the items are not the same as in the picture. Very cheap versions of the extra items ( flash, card holder, tripod, etc.) 
20154 4 So happy with this battery charger. It works well, I have already used it. I will continue to buy from you. 
20155 4 Great product. Great price. Quick delivery. Thanks. 
20156 4 Excellent 
20157 4 Really nice 
20158 4 It is a bit different from my other canons but I have learned that each time I get a new one I have to reteach myself but this one was fairly easy to pick up. 
20159 4 This monopod supports my heave lens and camera without any problem I also use the Sirui Aluminium Tilt Head L-10. 
20160 4 Works great! Good amount of accessories for the price. Green light when done. 
20161 4 Great camera, very good speed, overall quality and performance. I can t stop taking pics!. 
20162 4 Great camera. Use it to check on my dogs and it really works very well. Very easy to install. 
20163 4 I tried the camera 1 time so far. It has a clear picture and love it. Good buy and quality. 
20164 4 Great value for money. From a bit of a distance, you really can t tell they are fake. 
20165 4 Really great product and at an exceptional price. 
20166 4 Good quality, lightweight, and easy to adjust. 
20167 4 exactly what I was looking for and works great! 
20168 4 Great value 
20169 4 Great Quality - we recommend this item! 
20170 4 good 
20171 4 best 
20172 4 Great walking around lens. I also use it at work to shoot any product that doesn t require macro. 
20173 4 Compact and provides great protection. 
20174 4 this is one of my customers favorite backgrounds, it looks so real. I have used it often. 
20175 4 good quality product for the price, the case is very resistant and does great the job, about the quality of the images shot with it, a think is like 90%. lens are synthetic so, you will imagine. fit perfectly in 58mm mount. 
20176 4 Even nicer features than my DJI Phantom 2 Vision. Excellent delivery time and packaging from supplier. Truly “beyond expectations.&#34; 
20177 4 easy to use and works correctly 
20178 4 Great Camera! 
20179 4 Love this lens. Sharpest glass I ever owned. 
20180 4 My Sony was a bit small for it but it still worked great for white water rafting. Hope to use it in future travels. 
20181 4 Perfect 
20182 4 This filter does what it says...protects without introducing distortion. 
20183 1 The zipper gets jammed easy but it does it s job decently well 
20184 4 Nice unit worked very well 
20185 4 This has helped keep my SD cards safe and organized! I am very pleased with this purchase. 
20186 4 It is exactly what I ordered and what I expected 
20187 4 WOW, a lot of light for a little money... 
20188 4 awesome! 
20189 4 Got my camera quickly and set it up in less than 5 minutes! Works perfectly. 
20190 2 They work awesome but you can go to any hardware store and spend maybe .50 cents on a 1/4 inch screw and have the same product. 
20191 4 Very nice bag. Structured and holds everything I needed. Now a limited number remaining, so glad I found one on Amazon. 
20192 4 This worked perfectly for my nikon D3100. Love all the filters and especially the macro accessory kit. 
20193 4 Very good item to purchase at the time of buying a drone. 
20194 4 the Vivitar BG-E16 Battery Grip for Canon EOS 7DMKII was received in it orginal quality package. The grip was easy to install and use.allows me to take many photos than with the use of one battery, i recommend this Vivitar BG-E16 Battery Grip for Canon EOS 7D... to others 
20195 4 This is more camera than I ve ever had. I m still learning how to use it, but the auto mode has gotten me started rather easily. 
20196 4 Love it, my second one,- does all I need and for the price , one cannot beat it. Newer ones by all manufac have more bells and whistles, all depends what you need and want. AHK 
20197 4 works well! just what I needed for my Canon 
20198 3 Did the job. Only thing I d get alongside is some lights. Get some really strong lights, since some small desk lamps just didn t cut it. Otherwise, it s great for beginners who are trying to get into photography. 
20199 4 Holds a Nikon 650 with a 18-200 telephoto lens. Has a hard bottom that protects everything well. Like it and have used several different bags for camera & lens only. 
20200 1 I wasn t that pleased with this used camera. My camera (same as above) printed much better pictures until I dropped it. This one every pic is blurry and there is a rainbow that shows up and you have to wait until it clears to take a pic. 
20201 1 It breaks very easy. 
20202 4 (-: 
20203 4 It takes great pictures and video. I am impressed. 
20204 3 ok 
20205 2 My 8 year old loves this but the camera was broken (wires were not properly attached). 
20206 4 Great bag i love it 
20207 3 TALL...for someone that is 6 foot + tall this is a nice tripod so you don t have to bend as much. Only thing it doesn t have is spikes in the feet if it had those this would be perfect. Smooth operation and easy adjustments. 
20208 2 this is a fake SJcam but it still works. i was surprised when the wifi actually worked but you have to read instructions to figure out how to use it and for the pin. camera does not do well with fast moving shots but besides that its great. 
20209 4 Bought these for my wife for travel. She bought me a set a few years ago, really like them, powerful, lightweight, easy to pack. 
20210 4 Great case! Perfect as a carry-on when flying. 
20211 0 Returned due to inability to steer correctly. Also, it was used when we received it. 
20212 4 Exactly as described 
20213 4 The product was absolutely exactly as described and met or exceeded all expectations. 
20214 4 Works as expected. After many wild trips to patagonia, my case is doing very well keeping my camera dry and clean. 
20215 4 Better than expected and better than OEM. 
20216 4 Highly Recommended! 
20217 4 Best value package available! 
20218 4 My best buy last time. 
20219 3 Fits my EOS camera well and screws firmly into the AstroTech 2&#34; Field Flattener I m using it with. It has a firm lockup and positive release, both of which are great features to have in the dark while using the camera on a telescope. 
20220 4 You want a great quality camera that s fun to play with... This is it. Best quality and so much fun to play with 
20221 4 This is quite a good deal on items you want to have on hand if you buy a Canon Powershot camera! Excellent service, great delivery, very good mix of accessory products. 
20222 4 I am very pleased with this bag. High quality bag. 
20223 4 Works perfect, especially for $5. 
20224 4 Excellent! I thought I d never be able to use my portable picture maker again until I found this! Thank you!!!!! 
20225 3 Great deal. You just cannot have enough batteries or chargers for your electronics. 
20226 4 Perfect. 
20227 4 Very nice lens. 
20228 0 WOW, took 3 weeks to receive, then when I get it it is not even the same product.... everything is in Chinese. DO NOT BUY! 
20229 4 Great Lens for my Real Estate Business! 
20230 4 Bought this to have an extra one for my kit lens when I want to detach both lenses from the body for storage. 
20231 4 I love, I have had it for some time now and I have no issues with it. 
20232 4 great charger 
20233 4 I RECENTLY BOUGHT THIS SAME ONE AND LIKED IT SO MUCH I BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE! 
20234 2 This is decent, alittle too thick on the padding. but over all was descent. 
20235 3 Great stuff but pretty pricey. 
20236 4 great camera 
20237 4 Replacing the exact set and don t recall them being so right to start. Hopefully break in well. Soles on my old ones just starting to wear after two years of wearing 3-7 days a week. Top side worn as you d expect from heavy use. 
20238 4 Not much to say here. It worked and did not lose my GoPro. 
20239 4 great 
20240 3 Very sturdy. Met my expectations. 
20241 4 Worked just fine. Thanks 
20242 0 If im paying $1200 for a drone and it is supposed to be the best on the market i should have to deal with b.s. of having to update it. It should be ready to go right away 
20243 4 It is very good pic quality even at night. I am waiting to buy one more if price can be a little lower. 
20244 4 Best 
20245 4 Couldn t be happier with these! Can t beat it for the price! Works every time and haven t had an issue with it! 
20246 0 Does not fit the d750. The top piece needs to be much larger and it is not protecting it all the way. Do not buy this for the Nikon d750 
20247 0 Stick paper on back is terrible. Unit falls off! I ordered two of these and what a mistake that was. Also not that sensitive. I would not but this again. 
20248 0 Although delivery and packaging were perfectly fine, and apparently there are no scratches outside the case, inside my &#34;Brand New&#34; Pelican 1510 Case has a terrible, terrible cigarette smoke smell! The foam inside smells like complete smoke. I wonder if this is actually brand new. 
20249 0 not as advertised 
20250 4 Bought 3 units and they all are working great hope to buy more in the future. 
20251 2 It s alright. 
20252 4 the best night and day 
20253 4 Good 
20254 4 Works as expected 
20255 4 nice 
20256 1 I got this camera for the huge optical zoom feature. However, part way through a vacation in Europe, the camera locked up and stopped working. It is locked in the open position, but won t turn off, on or reset. Bad time to break. 
20257 0 They told me it would work for GoPro Hero 1 and it doesn t, very dissaponting! 
20258 4 This wired remote shutter release works very well and can be locked on for long &#34;bulb&#34; exposures. 
20259 3 So far photos are good, but it has a long delay in turning the screen on. That can be annoying when you miss shots while waiting for the screen to turn on. 
20260 2 The outdoor connection cable and camera wire need to be cover by duck tape. It is burned when wet. Mine one camera out of 4 was burned. I don t know if I can get a warranty to replace it or not. 
20261 2 Has very slow shutter speed 
20262 4 Very easy to set up, and I am able to watch my baby while im at work and she is at home with our Nanny. 
20263 3 Works well. 
20264 4 I ve tried several cases and this is the easiest to grab the camera. No more struggling to get the camera out of the bag. 
20265 4 This works really well ask a baby cam. We can now monitor our 5 months old even if we are in a different room. Great quality at a good price. We purchased it at a different store. 
20266 4 Excellent design and very comfortable to wear. Good selection and supply of dividers included. Very versatile. well shaped, etc. Can really make great use of the interior space. Superb value. 
20267 4 Excellent pair of binoculars. Light and compact - my wife has used them for the Muny Opera here In St. Louis and is thrilled with the results ! 
20268 4 Great Camera s 
20269 4 What can I say. It works. 
20270 4 Awesome kit! It was exactly like the discription, very fast shipping and great quality !!! 
20271 3 Does the job, nothing fancy. I realized too late that I should have bought the one with the remote, but that s no fault of this device. 
20272 4 great 
20273 4 Well made, attractive and adds a convenient handle rib to the front. Only negative is it adds to the height of the camera. 
20274 4 Very good！ 
20275 4 Perfect! 
20276 1 I bought this and immediately returned it. The head is made out of plastic and does not sit level when horizontal. 
20277 4 Great camera for the money 
20278 4 Hands down the best flash I have ever owned, although I wish I had waited and bought the model that has the built-in radio. Still works great with my wireless triggers. 
20279 1 Very bad 
20280 4 Spare battery for my cannon camera. It works just as good as my original 
20281 4 I had a little trouble with getting it to work with my LifeProof case for my phone at first. I tried it a second time and it works great. No complaints! 
20282 4 really nice works better than the battery that came with it 
20283 0 Pease of crap 
20284 4 Worth the price 
20285 4 Great products and price for a beginner like myself! 
20286 4 Great replacement battery 
20287 4 Great product 
20288 1 Came in scratched/chipped and clip broke immediately. Video is ok sound is horrible. I use it as a dash cam. So sound wasn t important. Kept it because it as cheap. 
20289 4 Shall i say more....it s an oem battery and it surpasses all imitators. Good price here on AMAZON 
20290 4 Works great. Have yet to field test them 
20291 4 great price and fit and quality 
20292 4 Clear view, not happy about case 
20293 0 Broke almost immediately after being delivered to may home. 
20294 2 It came without the base that attaches to the belt. 
20295 1 Most pictures came out blurry. My old 16.1 mp camera was much better. All this camera did was prove to me that there is more to pictures than megapixels. Videos came out fine though. 
20296 4 Pictures come out clear and quality of product is good! 
20297 4 Great product, great price 
20298 4 Good buy 
20299 3 Its very easy to work, its just what I needed! 
20300 4 Is works fine 
20301 4 Great fun. Had to re-bind the wifi so it worked but after that, awesome photos and videos 
20302 4 Nice an useful 
20303 4 Love this lens! 
20304 0 Well worth what I paid for it and it was so easy to set up! I ll be getting a few more. May 2016, NOT anymore...they updated and now both my cameras always say offline and will not connect. 
20305 4 Good product, good price. I like the rapid charger, it takes less time than charging on the computer and having the 3 back up batteries comes in handy. 
20306 4 Perfect for what I was needing to hold my Video camera while riding. 
20307 4 Great buy!!! 
20308 4 I like it 
20309 4 i totally loved this lens..but it only lasted about 3 years..then the focus element stopped working..:/ so i sold it to someone that was willing to have it fixed..it was too expensive for me..so i don´t have it anymore..someone else is loving it now..:) 
20310 4 Great case for my new camera and accessories. Plenty of room and easy to organize. 
20311 4 Great camera, easy to set up. 
20312 0 Very disappointed. These glasses would not hold a charge. 
20313 4 Perfect. 
20314 4 Good. 
20315 3 This light weight tripod is exactly what I was looking for. I record presentations using an iPod Touch, and this tripod is small enough to pack, tall enough to see over people s heads and strong enough to handle the weight of the device. 
20316 1 Cheap quality 
20317 4 A great camera. It s going to take me a while to learn how to use it properly but I m very pleased with it. 
20318 4 Good buy. 
20319 4 great battery 
20320 4 The camera s sensitivity is amazing since I can see even with dim lighting. 
20321 1 Tried it on a Nikon D3300 and it washed everything out and had a very strong flash even on the lowest setting. Its a nice idea for a flash, but didn t work for me. 
20322 0 I took about 300 pictures during the first half of my trip to Norway just fine. The next time I turned on the camera one third of the screen had black bars across. I have had the camera less than one week. I am not impressed. 
20323 4 Works, fits my nex. 
20324 1 I have long used Nikon but thought i would try Canon. I am not happy with the quality of my pics. I will be switching back and selling this one. 
20325 4 Just got it today, initial testings looks positive, will update after the filed test. 
20326 4 Excellent product! Great deal. 
20327 4 Great product 
20328 2 No zoom feature. Otherwise works well 
20329 3 Charder for my battery just fine. The materials that the charger are made from don t seem to be the best quality but it works just fine. It charges quickly and easy to store with it s size. 
20330 4 Good ítem!! Thanx 
20331 4 Very great camera for the price! Would recomend to anyone. 
20332 4 Oh my god,twice as cheap as the Canon type and oh so good. If this is what you need stop now and buy,buy,buy. 
20333 4 Yes it was in very good condition. Thanks 
20334 4 Love the lens. Works.just as expected

20336 4 good 
20337 3 Great camera 
20338 2 I mostly love this camera; however, I always have difficulties transferring the files to the computer. The USB doesn t work and the wi fi works most of the time but is very slow and skips files sometimes. 
20339 2 excellent item, solved my problem 
20340 4 Very goos 
20341 4 I m New to dslr photography, these lenses & case appears good quality and fair price. Always look to this seller first for my needs. 
20342 4 Very good 
20343 4 Great set!! Everything fits into the bag and easy to use! The lights are wonderful and take great pics! 
20344 4 Love this camera. It s a bit of a dinosaur, but the lens is top notch quality and has a huge zoom capacity. Easy to use. 
20345 4 Excelente 
20346 4 Great Buy ! 
20347 4 love it 
20348 3 Overall good product. However, the speed disconnect is wobbly when attached and the knob to turn the mounting screw quickly broke. These issues did not address the functionality too much. 
20349 4 Thes are a bigger than expected size and I love them! They do not smudge or smear on your lense. Clean and scratch free. 
20350 2 Stand is cheaply made only used it a couple times and one of the pins came out of the leg. I have it rigged for now. Spend a little more for a better quality product. 
20351 4 Lightweight and compact design with great power. Well done. 
20352 4 Great product!! 
20353 3 happy 
20354 3 This product works as expected and is well built. 
20355 4 Used camera on a trip to Canada. Wonderful films! 
20356 4 works great ... I actually purchased yet another so can adapt (through modification) old Bay 60 filters to my prime nikon lens that I use for scenics. Good price for what you get. 
20357 2 clasp and handle are cheesy, ready to fall off 
20358 2 Ohh man! Missing parts in the first fly! 1 in 4 motors stop working! I have to buy the new replacement! The camera no good at all, it s too slow and too dark, need upgrades to 12.Mb 
20359 0 Doesn t work! It was advertise that it will work with Samsung Google Nexus and it doesn t! 
20360 4 It works very well. There is even an extra battery that I didn t expect. 
20361 4 I have so many old slides from the early nineties that I am able to view with ease now. The back light on this Medalight viewer is nice and bright!!! 
20362 4 Works as advertised. 
20363 4 This product is awesome! I use this to clamp onto the side of an L bracket on my D750. It gives me another hot shoe adapter for a profoto B1 trigger so I can use off camera lighting alongside a speedlight flash. It is built solid and feels reliable. 
20364 4 Awesome! Works perfectly. High quality, sturdy. 
20365 0 It was broken when it arrived. 
20366 4 I love this tripod I used it for all my recordings and photo shoot ♥ 
20367 4 Seems good quality & worked for me. Good price. 
20368 4 No reason not to love it, simple enough! 
20369 4 Very Well Satisfied with my purchase. 
20370 4 amazing bag. Fits all my drone gear plus my a7s and 3 lenses and atomos shogun, all batteries.. goddang this is a good bag.. EVERYTHING! audio equipment too 
20371 3 Excellent so far 
20372 4 Excellent 
20373 3 Good camera for the price 
20374 4 PERFECT for quadrotor video recording paired with FPV. My gopros are a bit too heavy to put on my 250 racer, so this was a no brainer. Quality is on par with my hero 2 and hero3 silver. Size and weight is great and the quality is awesome too. 
20375 4 Sweet price for a bunch of handy power adapters! 
20376 3 I love this case. Hold my digital camera and extra batteries in a well-protected bag. 
20377 1 Will only support a small compact camera. 
20378 4 Holy moley this camera is a champ!!! Its so clear!! So many features; especially manually! Makes me seem like a pro :). 
20379 4 We use it to clean lenses that we rent. Its easy to use and has enough &#34;air power&#34; to remove normal debris. 
20380 1 Crappy video Quality. The 720 statement while technically true makes it sound like it can record HD video. However, the video and picture quality isn t even as good as standard definition 480i tv. 
20381 4 Great, met all of my expectations 
20382 4 Hi. Quick delivery. Product conforms. Thanks 
20383 3 Good product! 
20384 3 I was surprised at the quality of this - I ve had it on my camera for 2.5 years now and it s still holding up like a champ! 
20385 4 Great deal for backup and replacement batteries. 
20386 0 Would not hold a charge returned it Love Amazon they took care of me 
20387 4 Perfect for all my pictures 
20388 4 I love it, excellent bubble free screen protector, if you follow the instruction you can apply it in proper place- no hassle, delivery was before time, very good service. 
20389 2 Good camera but no alerts to my phone at work, sent back and got another that did more the Wi-Fi. 
20390 4 Super good and best part of this item the price 
20391 1 To expensive 
20392 1 They did not meet my expectations. They are not really what I would call microfiber, they are not as soft. 
20393 4 great case 
20394 3 A fine lens for a good price, well done Adorama. 
20395 3 Great product for the price point.. they give off a nice natural light and can be changed many heights and directions. Quite pleased. 
20396 4 takes great pictures but flash is cheaply made 
20397 4 Filter performed as expected. I m quite happy with it. 
20398 0 The battery leaked and the camera spoils. 
20399 4 Good Communication, very nice product, Item as described A+++ Seller 
20400 4 If you don t have steady hands or can t just pull a piece off to look at then this ain t for you. 
20401 4 I will order them again when needed. 
20402 4 great value and excellent product 
20403 1 these make an incredibly loud cheap sound, making it obvious that they are fake. 
20404 4 Loved it for the time I had it, became obsolete when the IPhone showed up, but worked well! 
20405 4 Pretty good looking and nicely made case! 
20406 1 its ok. ive had better 
20407 4 these blocks are so cute. the price is great. i didn t want blocks that looked too childish, as i knew i would be using them for years 
20408 4 For true color, quick setup, portability, must have for professionals. 
20409 4 Frame worked great. It held our GoPro on our car from NJ to FL! 
20410 4 Perfect fit and as good as the Canon version. 
20411 3 Works great! Awesome pricing! 
20412 4 Used this in the field with good results. 
20413 4 Works as expected 
20414 2 works as it should 
20415 3 Works well and doesn t interfere with controls 
20416 4 The latest model of Zhiyun,it seems great! I d like to try it! 
20417 4 Great kit and camera. I only wish it came with a floating handle for taking in the water. If you drop it, that type of handle actually floats with the camera. If they would add that handle to this kit.....it would be perfect! 
20418 3 Works just fine. I won t say it shoots every time, but it s pretty consistent. 
20419 3 Pudiera ser mejor. 
20420 4 Gift for my Father-in-law, he was very pleased. 
20421 4 Exactly as described, arrived promptly, well packed. New batteries have significantly greater run life than original equipment. Charger works well with the benefit of car adapter and european plug adapter as bonuses. 
20422 4 Beautiful Picture Quality. Decent stock lens. Highly recommend picking up additional lenses. 
20423 4 Love! Great underwater and above water pictures! 
20424 4 I love the case. I am glad that I can finally protect my camera. It s really a cute looking case. 
20425 2 Hard to use and focus. 
20426 4 I m using this adapter to mount my DJI Ronin base-plate. It s not a perfect fit, in that the safety mechanism doesn t function correctly, but it slides in and locks down tight. Nice budget option. 
20427 4 Worked fine 
20428 4 Great, just what we needed 
20429 4 Cool!!! Love it! 
20430 4 Good 
20431 4 Perfect fit on Hero 4 and good quality. 
20432 3 Works great on glass. Has some trouble sticking to other car surfaces. 
20433 3 Overall the product was exactly as described. The directions/manual that it came with, however was not very helpful. 
20434 4 Helped get pictures off of a discarded phone. 
20435 4 Had everything I wanted and more very pleased 
20436 2 It needs a bit of some flex for the screw to tighten down the camera to where it won t move. Other than that, it is built well and is heavy duty. 
20437 4 LOVE IT 
20438 3 Compared to the original one, it seems weaker. 
20439 4 This tripod is great ! Nice and sterdy amd I can count on it for anything. 
20440 4 Super portable and great image quality - awesome for hiking! 
20441 4 no complaints 
20442 4 Everything was great! 
20443 3 nice design, this would not fall off the camera as other s have, but I m sending it back because I d have to take it off for wide angle shots because you can see a portion of the hood in the shot 
20444 4 +1000 
20445 0 Did not as described or pictured. Does not come with bnc-bnc connectors. Comes with bnc-male rca. 
20446 4 It is the best microfiber lens leaner I ever used in the past 10 years. 
20447 0 I cannot give an accurate description of how well this device works. In the product details it clearly states that it works for the Nikon d750, which the MC-36B is supposed to, however the unit that arrived is the MC-DC2 for Nikon D90/3100/7000/5200/5100 
20448 2 Was good while it lasted, but not very durable 
20449 3 GOOD PRODUCT 
20450 4 works great, a little different than normal, but not a bad thing, very happy with shoulder strap 
20451 4 Fast shipping, easy installation and inexpensive. We installed them in every window in our house. It makes enough noise for unexpected guest. 
20452 4 Works like a charm 
20453 4 good quality 
20454 4 Camera works like it should, the only think I didn t like was that the app for foscam are not to good 
20455 4 It is what it is , great material great price 
20456 4 Price was right. As a backup battery we will see how it performs in the future 
20457 0 Siren cannot be heard @10 away Replaced batteries 3 different new ones two different brands three different packages 
20458 4 My teenage daughter loves this! 
20459 4 Perfectly designed for it s purpose with superbly quality. Works great with Desmond DBC-01 RC2 Compatible Clamp. 
20460 0 Not get to what I expected 
20461 4 Awesome. Very clear and work very very good at night. I put one on the front porch and there is no, I mean no light out there, it s still clear as a bell. I love them and would recommend them to my friends. 
20462 4 At last this is what my Gopro3 was missing a good lasting battery that doesn t drain by itself 
20463 4 I love these old style cameras and although the video quality is not great, I just like the style. 
20464 2 Price for this type of item 
20465 4 Fit my canon camera just fine and has plenty of strength for being quite a small chord. 
20466 4 They work so well I now have 4. No nonsense triggers. 
20467 4 Vincent did an excellent job setting up this camera. It seems a complicated procedure, but he zipped right through. I have not had a chance to try the cam out yet, but I was happy with the installation process. 
20468 4 Perfect 
20469 4 perfect 
20470 4 Haven t used these yet, but the first set of 50 were great. Grandkids had a ball taking pictures 
20471 4 Worked like a charm! I did not have to buy a special camera, just used an old one! 
20472 4 Very good 
20473 4 Needed for Santa pictures - worked out great. 
20474 4 Item came quickly and as described. Bought this 5 weeks ago. Straps are holding up well. 
20475 1 I could not give 5 stars, because the screwing mechanism was lose, and basically the upper and lower halves of the pen did not remain attached. But the camera worked. 
20476 4 Great deal! Great delivery time! Thank you! 
20477 3 Feels fake but it works well 
20478 4 excellent 
20479 3 Great for price but definitely not high quality material. It does what it s meant to do. 
20480 4 No problems with product and/or delivery. Works as described. 
20481 4 Perfect size for my GoPro. Now I want other sizes. 
20482 0 Pain in the butt to hook into your wireless, useless if you re trying to see outside at night in front of a window. OK for interior use only! The mobile phone app is junk and always kicks out on you. 
20483 0 Not an infrared filter - it is basically a neutral density filter - you can see light through the filter. 
20484 0 Did not like this product at all. I thought maybe the camear was damaged so I reordered needless to say, I was unable to that to work. 
20485 3 Works well and value for money. 
20486 0 camera was not reliable and just not to be trusted. i could be standing in room, jumping and moving around for several minutes and it would show me still sitting on couch from 10 minutes previous and act like everything was great. not great! sorry, but just not reliable. 
20487 2 so far so good 
20488 4 Buen producto ! 
20489 4 Seems to work fine. Great price 
20490 4 Fully compatible. Works great. 
20491 4 great product and is great at the price goes every where with him. 
20492 4 Works fine and doesn t wear down too fast. 
20493 0 Don t waste your money! 
20494 0 HORRIBLE TOOK TO GERMANY PICTURES CAME OUT HORRIBLE 
20495 4 Good 
20496 4 Great Product 
20497 0 batterys fit to tight in charger slot that makes them very hard to get in or out. 
20498 4 excellent product. 
20499 4 Worked great as replacement for old contacts 
20500 3 Everything came right away, I have used the head mount, floating handle, suction cup mount and the handle bar mount. It s all worked great so far, but right when I took the tripod out, one of the legs broke off and it seems really flimsy 
20501 4 These transmitters and receivers work perfectly on my Nikon D810 
20502 3 This is a decent scope, especially for the money. However, I upgraded tot he Celestron Regal 100mm and it is considerably more clear at all magnifications. If you have the coin, skip this one, and go for the upgrade model. 
20503 4 Camera arrived quickly and meets all my expectations. 
20504 2 ok for beginner video 
20505 4 Great semi-professional lens, especially for the price. Very fast focus. I use it on a D5200. 
20506 3 Yet again I have had to replace my lens cap after it has falled off the lens and been lost, but this time they have changed the design. I believe that the cap design is better - it appears to have a tighter grip on the lens. Time will tell!! 
20507 0 Film keeps getting stuck in back on my camera and wont print out photos. help? Very disappointed on the waste of money. 
20508 4 Worked perfect for my Cannon sx280 hs 
20509 1 Takes a llooonng time to find the right adjustment for your camera, and the product alone is quite heavy. My arms start hurting after only 15min of straight use. 
20510 4 We think it works great and brings things in much closer. 
20511 0 very disappointed very cheaply made will not work on my pc works on my dads pc hard to focus very light weight and unstable seller sent me the 200x not the 300x I ordered 
20512 1 It does not hold the charge as well as my original canon batteries, which are quite old. 
20513 3 Excellent filter. Better than my previous filters which scratched up easily. 
20514 0 This battery is not compatible with Polaroid t730. I am not planning to buy another battery, as I thought this brand would have been compatible compared to the other, also purchased from Amazon. 
20515 4 Works great! 
20516 4 This is a great option to protect my lens and to filter the uv rays. This is exactly what I expected and it is a great value compared to similar lens filters. 
20517 4 Great little charger. 
20518 0 I have had this camera for about a year now and it quit working. It would get moisture in it and wouldn t turn on when I wanted it to. I wasn t very impressed with it. 
20519 3 It is great cable wire but not what we needed at the time but, we did find another use for it by changing out the connector ends. Thank you once again Amazon for such quick delivery. 
20520 4 Great product 
20521 4 Great lens 
20522 4 Got this as a gift for my sil...amazing quality camera for the price! 
20523 0 These do NOT fit the Sony NEX-3NL camera. Otherwise they seem like nice lenses 
20524 1 Worked Great for about 2 weeks, not wont go up past about 1/3 of the way. If I reset and move the camera up my self a few times it works for a day then quits again. =( Really liked this camera too. 
20525 3 Product was as advertised. 
20526 4 Love it. If the package could include a gopro locking screw that would be perfect. 
20527 3 No complaints! 
20528 4 Great camera and customer service. 
20529 4 GREAT PRODUCT FOR BEGINERS! 
20530 4 very good 
20531 4 AAAAA+++++ 
20532 4 Brandon in technical support was great, he was able to install the camera in minutes and was very polite and helpful. Now the camera works with no problems. 
20533 4 Great professional camera! It was great experience. It included everything that you need to do perfect pictures. Delivery was in time, everything was great. 
20534 4 perfect size and very light, will love it on upcoming vacation. My Nikon P600 is perfect size in this bag with room for extra batteries and cards. Thank you. 
20535 3 Pretty easy to use, not sure how or if it can be used without Wi-fi as in can be used cellular and it s pretty slow to move the camera via wi-fi but it s pretty cool and cheap. 
20536 4 Just needed it and arrived on ti,e good quality. 
20537 0 The USB wire doesnt fit well the charger the battery doesnt charge, bad experience see picture, part of the USB stays out of the charger i dont know if thisbis normal but it doesnt work 
20538 0 Dead on arrival. Tried it with multiple flashes, fresh new batteries, and then a different set of fresh new batteries. Requested a replacement or refund from Yongnuo and they refused (so much for standing behind a warranty). Risky purchase, poor customer service. You ve been warned. 
20539 4 Just what I needed and it got to me so fast I swear I blinked and bam I had it. Great battery and price. Do not waste your time shopping around, here it is and at the click of a button it is yours and in your hands fast! 
20540 2 Worked from June to February and then because it is not waterproof, it rusted where the batteries are and quit working. 
20541 4 worked fine 
20542 4 This is the nicest bag - fit my Nikon and 2 large lenses plus batteries and charger. It looks beautiful and feels like my purse ( it also fits all of my purse stuff). Earth tone colors - perfect for me. 
20543 3 Loving it :) 
20544 3 I think this item is very durable and the price is also reasonable. However, the reach of the mount is a little short because it consists of two separated sticks, not three sticks. Anyway, it was useful for my diving. 
20545 4 Excellent service and product. I received my product timely and the item works well. 
20546 0 unfortunately the remote does NOT work, the right button is so low set that you cannot access it and the left hand button works only occasionally. I need to return this item, so please send return mailing label. 
20547 1 Even tightened all of the way down, the arms still move around. The result is a shaky video, and unreliable angles as the mount is move around (mounted on my motorcycle). I would look for a different brand. 
20548 4 Best point and shoot I have ever encountered! Pictures look as good as my Nikon DSLR 3100. More settings than I will ever need, but there if I want them. If you are on the fence about this camera just go ahead and get one before they run out. 
20549 4 It is inexpensive and works great..... what more can you ask from a light diffuser? 
20550 2 Not very well made. ....same thing with this pen. I have no more ink and have no way or replacing it....thanks seller. 
20551 3 These fit decently, but you can tell that they are not perfect. Don t quite &#34;click&#34; on the way they should and when the two won t screw together (bad sign). 
20552 4 Makes the slides gook great. 
20553 3 Nice little camera. Bought it to take basic vacation pics. Got a water proof case as well and took pics with it underwater. 
20554 3 I mean, what can you say? It is inexpensive and it works. Arrived when it should have. 
20555 4 Perfect little bag for on the go!!! 
20556 4 Nice product so far. I ve been having it for a week now and I have no problem with it. 
20557 2 These might be nice binoculars for viewing the stars, but they are terrible for viewing Dolphins from our patio. I guess the Dolphins are just too fast. 
20558 2 Good product but arrived without instructions 
20559 2 Don t tweak it too hard or the joints pop out. Can be snapped back but annoying. 
20560 4 Perfect fit for my 5 gal. bottles. Nice and tight. 
20561 2 great 
20562 4 very sturdy, works on uneven ground 
20563 4 battery works great with my camera 
20564 4 Amazing product!! 
20565 4 Everything arrived ok! Great product. 
20566 3 Awesome mounts 
20567 4 Great price!! 
20568 4 working very good 
20569 4 Almost no ghosts or anything. Cleans with ease by breathing and wiping with a microfiber cloth. Hoya HDs are the best. 
20570 4 Nice lightweight & adjustable! Very, very, very bright ont he highest setting. This will also take AA batteries or other various camera batteries. Includes the shoe/tipod mount. Very happy with the product. 
20571 0 In possible to navigate to set it up 
20572 4 Nice size and works as intended. Light weight so I always have it in my camera bag. Of the times I didn t bring it, I regret it. 
20573 0 Have you read setup instructions for wireless camera? OMG -- IP configuration required ..... give me a break it s 2015. Sending box back today! 
20574 4 Good, cheap insurance.... 
20575 3 Smallervthan I thought, but it works. 
20576 4 excellent 
20577 4 No words to explain how much I like it. 
20578 4 Very clear and good resolution. Does very close up pics. Color is accurate. 
20579 4 Solid construction and smart design. A great mono pod for a decent price. 
20580 3 They did a good job, film is of good quality. I would recommend this company to friends. 
20581 2 Acts funny in my camera, like it s not sure if this is an OE battery. holds a charge as I would expect. 
20582 4 This is a good quality versatile mount that arrives in nice packaging. Good value overall and works well 
20583 4 Fast delivery and as described, thanks. 
20584 4 Great product 
20585 2 I have 2 sj4000 knock off. The picture is great but the sound really sucks. But i use it on a quadcopter, so i don t need good sound. If you are going to record sounds don t bother buying this thing. 
20586 4 Very sturdy and light. A good fit. 
20587 0 Doesn t work how I expected. The night shoot is mainly why I purchased this camera and it works horribly. It was not checked before sold because it still had the last owners person pictures and video. The sound quality is also awful. 
20588 4 great 
20589 4 Delivered on time and as per description 
20590 4 Great camera for the price. We take it on vacation so we don t have to use our phones. 
20591 1 Does Not do what instructions say it does. Have not being able to set the motion detection. 
20592 2 No comments 
20593 4 Perfect for my needs. I am not a professional but take lots of pictures for friends and family. 
20594 4 Sturdy 
20595 4 I really love these styles that they come in and instead of having plain white pictures spice it up with these border stickers! 
20596 4 Happy with the shipping, the product and the price. Highly recommend! 
20597 4 Perfect gift for collecting memories. Good Value and Quality 
20598 3 Nice telescope. Setup was pretty simple. The star alignment process required some time to get it right but all in all we like the telescope and good for us novice. 
20599 4 Great and really works. 
20600 4 The battery worked out great. I purchased the battery as a spare for my lecia v-lux 4 which is the same as the Leica battery at half the price with the same specs. 
20601 0 The instructions are impossible to follow. When you call Tech Support, you they re angry and condescending. In the end, they can t help you and your stuck with a very expensive piece of crap. 
20602 4 I ve had my Hello Kitty camper for about a month or so and I LOVE IT!!! I recieved it fast and it was just prefect!!! 
20603 4 This is a perfect product what I am searching. Its awesome product and very easy to use. Don t miss like this product and its very cheap cost they are offering. Its looking very nice and very easy to handle with remarkable comfort. 
20604 4 On time and as described. Fits perfectly 
20605 0 I cannot off load any images what a waste of money 
20606 4 Really relieves the pressure around my neck on long wedding days carrying a heavy body and lens. 
20607 4 Well made cap. Lost mine during a basketball game and I am very happy that this cap looked and felt like the original cap. 
20608 3 Works perfectly, charges in Canon charger. Fast delivery. The only reason I didn t give 5 stars is that I don t know how long the battery will last, other than that don t hesitate to buy 
20609 2 It needs to be charged too much. 
20610 3 Good case but not as convenient as I thought it would be. 
20611 0 Doesn t fit newer hero s 
20612 2 not smooth! 
20613 1 Just ok 
20614 4 Great experience 
20615 3 Product is great for the price. it arrived quickly and suction cup adheres to the windshield very securely. The plastic screw mount is a bit flimsy when tightening the screw thread to camera but does the job for my small action camera. 
20616 4 Absolutely fantastic. 
20617 4 Does what it says on the tin. Offers better grip and good protection for the camera. 
20618 4 Nice!!! Much sturdier than the cheezy tripods often packed with inexpensive photo accessories. The ball mount actually locks tightly! 
20619 4 sme as gopro 
20620 4 I was lucky enough to not get a fake battery. Watch out for that. That s all I can really say, it works just like my original T3i battery. 
20621 4 Got it as a gift for my daughter and she loves it. 
20622 4 Bought this because of the price and I love it. Exactly what I was looking for to diffuse the onboard flash on my camera. Easy to use and folds up nicely. 
20623 4 HSS works with Cheetahstand CL-360 
20624 4 Great buy 
20625 3 The side screw has no function and I managed to work it with an old threaded rod I found. 
20626 4 Good service and everything in perfect working conditions 
20627 4 Light weight but yet sturdy. Fluid head 
20628 4 Awesome just what I ordered thank you very much works wonderful 
20629 4 Exactly what I ordered. The cable meets my needs perfectly. Thank you... 
20630 2 Is very good pictures are great and clear day or night but the back round you hear when the speak is on must be fixed 
20631 4 Great kit full of useful components 
20632 4 excellent 
20633 2 Aperture ring is rough - a so so so product 
20634 4 Really love these triggers! The best feature in my opinion is the ability to control your flash power on the controller itself. Saves so much time! 
20635 2 excellent item, very useful for whatever you want, 
20636 0 Incredibly difficult to use. Minimal directions. Photos either did not display, or displayed upside down. I spent a significant amount of time reformatting photos and rotating them only to have the frame not save any of my work. Not worth the trouble. 
20637 4 This case is part of the reason why I wanted the Nikon 1. I loved the sleek design and the fact that it protected the camera without making it huge. We were happy that this fit inside my husband s cargo pocket when we were at an amusement park. 
20638 0 Charged the batteries without a problem, but when I put them into my Nikon D3200, the camera would not accept them as usable. So, they are useless to me. Money down the drain. 
20639 4 This gives the camera a better overall grip, making it more comfortable to hold and less movement (in my opinion) when pressing the shutter down. It s not a perfect match to the color of the camera but so close, you won t notice unless you re really looking. 
20640 4 it came 5 or 6 dys early the case is very durable protects camera from many things even knives(I was bored and I m a guy :-P) the camera is great especially for the low price the mounts work and it is definetly waterproof in case 
20641 4 This battery grip was well worth the money. It holds 2 batteries and works great for various picture positions, without the need to contort your hands. 
20642 4 great! 
20643 4 I like this so well I have one for every flash I have (5). 
20644 3 Im old fashioned! Miss the instructions on paper.... 
20645 4 The case is great for my compact camera and accessories. 
20646 4 it work very well and is preciely wha i needed.,good value for the money 
20647 4 i love it 
20648 4 My new lens came right away. Due to the hot weather, I haven t been able to use it much, but I m looking forward to enjoying it when the cooler temps get here. Thank you. 
20649 2 Very easy set up. App has an easy to work with interface. Night mode produces clear visuals. Very little lag within normal lighted visuals. 
20650 4 pretty good ofr watching birds 
20651 4 Works well. I bought several sets. monitor both the front and back of house. be careful though once you add a camera to a channel on one monitor it cannot be added to the same channel on another monitor 
20652 4 I`m pro wadding photographer w. 20 years of experience I just purchased that one to have extra lens in my case and I have exactly same lens made in Japan .... Compare both of them no difference in the quality 
20653 4 Excellent product 
20654 4 Good deal. Thannks.. 
20655 4 great value and excellent product 
20656 4 Will return to seller. 
20657 4 I ve been using it for 2 weeks, and i love it. I would buy this again, as well as recomend it to friends. 
20658 0 Would not even lift off once. Bought extra batteries, fully charged them, nothing. Rotors spun but never lifted off. Thanks for ruining a six year olds birthday. 
20659 0 Not terribly professional except for the company logo embossed on the cheap plastic tie. 
20660 3 Holds all the accessories for the camera. 
20661 4 With the kit lens, it fits fine even over the viewfinder. Just don t forget to push in underneath the camera when shooting. 
20662 4 A+ would order from here again! 
20663 4 Did not come with a book manual on how to use the camera. My brother had the same camera so he was able to show me the basics but can find the user manual online. Love the camera and all the accessories that came with it. 
20664 4 works fine 
20665 2 The waterproof feature worked great, but almost all photos on land were blurry. 
20666 4 Great 
20667 4 Great camera, easy to install, works great with the app. 
20668 0 This was terrible, I had it for less than a week and one of the legs wont stay pulled down and one of the legs slides off the top connection bit very easily. You get what you pay for with this product 
20669 4 Works great and way better priced (like half) than I found in stores anywhere. 
20670 4 great transaction. Product as described 
20671 2 Pretty flimsy, doesn t realy provide much support. I wouldn t trust an expensive camera in it 
20672 4 I love this i no longer have to pocket my lense caps and hope I don t lose them or forget where I put it 
20673 3 GREAT SELLER PRODUCT WORKED GREAT 
20674 3 Thank You 
20675 4 works well 
20676 4 This monitor is everything in description plus some. I will be purchasing again. 
20677 4 Very nice glass, highly recommended. 
20678 4 Don t go flying without it! It s nice to hear the beeping while flying so you know when to come in for a landing. There s nothing like losing power while hundreds of feet in the air! 
20679 4 Love this product. Such a good product for so little investment. I m Not a professional photographer though. 
20680 3 Arrival time was as posted, merchandise as promised 
20681 4 I love this lens. While I am still learning all the ins and outs of using a prime lens, the photos I ve taken with this really jump out ... I m very excited about learning more. 
20682 4 Such a fun item. Really love flying this drone, best one out there for the money to practice with. Only wish the battery life would last longer, but still a great product!! 
20683 4 Great filter. Fits perfect. The moon looks amazing. Thank you so much for a great product. 
20684 3 The lenses and accessories are great. I only wish there were some instructions. 
20685 4 I am very happy with this purchase. 
20686 4 Works great as expected. 
20687 4 Great performance! Love it! 
20688 4 Purchased as a gift. Super big hit! Fantastic product. 
20689 4 I couldn t be happier. 
20690 2 I tested each camera before installing on exterior of my house. 1 Camera had water inside of it and does not work the other three are good. 
20691 4 Exactly what I was after. Works well 
20692 2 The stick is not sturdy enough. When at full length, it is hard to handle it and take a proper selfie 
20693 4 Fine Dvr and cameras. Nice night vision too. Just needs better documentation. 
20694 0 Didn t work with my Nikon :-( 
20695 4 danny gave me great tech support and was able to hook up my camera. The camera is clear and easy to use. 
20696 3 somehow i need to use 3 swab to completely clean my D7000 sensor. Maybe the dirt has settled too long. 
20697 4 Great product for price. Attached to lens very easy. 
20698 4 These work great and will fit on any speed light. Good value. 
20699 4 Works Perfect 
20700 3 its a cool camera. the control on the dial switch for camera mode, moves on its own while you re shooting and that sucks. otherwise i would have given it a 5 
20701 3 Does a good job during the day and night 
20702 1 The extendable Telescopi Handle turns arround with the weight of the Go Pro, its not usefull. Tripod its OK. 
20703 4 The cameras have excellent clarity. Easy to set up - when I had a small glinch Dlink tech worked with me until it was resolved. DLink has the best customer service. Thank you Allen your were so knowledgeable and patient. AR004639 
20704 4 My old camera died after around 6 years love this camera for inside the house you can place it almost any place works real nice in low light 
20705 4 Was delivered on time. Happy with the drone. 
20706 4 good picture, great price 
20707 2 it s expensive and if you want to record you must pay monthly. 
20708 4 Awesome!! Great handheld light wand. Thin and the lights are very bright. 
20709 4 I was thinking is gonna come with memory card! 
20710 2 Recording time only lasts about 3 hours 
20711 4 works. 
20712 4 This recorder is working great so far , I will keep this updated in a months 
20713 3 This recharges batteries quickly. I purchased it for a long trip where thousands of photos are likely to be taken. So far there has been no problems. 
20714 4 I liked the product, and had no trouble with the purchase. thank YoU! 
20715 4 what I needed igot 
20716 4 Great quality and value. 
20717 4 Works really well. Not to difficult to add to the flash. Folds down and fits in my camera bag perfectly 
20718 4 Batteries arrived on time and were well-packaged. They are a fraction of the price of Canon batteries and do the job. I ll definitely do business with GOJA again. 
20719 4 Great product, Thanks. 
20720 4 Sorry for later writing the comments on it, this one is quite goods, it brings lot of fun in my life, I do see lots of nice birds. It s fantasic. 
20721 4 Works well. 
20722 1 we lost our camera LOL 
20723 0 Pin is too big on the door to use. Took to a camera store and they agreed... Can t use it. 
20724 4 This has worked fine for me for over 4? years. No problems... 
20725 4 love it 
20726 4 Heavy device. Needs a good tripod to use this device. Can carry bigger cam or photo camera 
20727 4 Great product! 
20728 0 Fitted nicely with my instax mini, but after using it for literally a few mintues the strap broke off. And the color is a lot darker than the picture. 
20729 4 Got it and setup was easy and it worked immediately. Seems to be a great product so far and I am looking forward to more usage. 
20730 2 As expected 
20731 4 Camera was awesome for a Caribbean cruise... Took great underwater pictures. 
20732 2 It performed as it was supposed to, but I returned because it covered too much of the LCD screen as well as the delete and review buttons on my D7100. Also, once on, difficult to remove! 
20733 4 It is awesome I would highly recommend this if your gonna shoot a lot of pictures. 
20734 1 There are many out there that look the same. This isn t the one that you want, can hardly hold a small phone.Waste of money. 
20735 1 It seems a little stiff, but soft. It smells HORRIBLE right out of the package though. I m just kinda disappointed, but if my opinion changes (when it smells better and loosens up) I ll change my review. 
20736 3 Pleasantly surprised. Easy to put on - no air bubbles. Works great and would recommend 
20737 4 one of the best camara protection I bought 
20738 4 Product was as advertised. 
20739 4 Them two extra batteries and 12V&110V charger is great thing to have they last 2x longer then OEM in my sony290 camera thanks for great deal 
20740 4 Great quality product with affordable price. Well worth the money. 
20741 2 Was pretty good. the seam on the handle broke the day I got it. Bummer 
20742 4 Excellent Camera!!! Highly recommend. Takes Beautiful Pics!!! 
20743 1 came scratched 
20744 1 Do not buy it! Damaged from my first use, very small and good for pocket, but since I used the coin to fix the camera, two of rubber pieces damaged.. 5 minutes only after unpacking! 
20745 4 Makes a world of difference on my D700. Manual focus is very sharp when using this eyepiece. I recommend it. 
20746 3 A perfect fit for my cannon camera and the 2 extra batteries is even made it better, didn t have to worry I was going to run out of batteries. 
20747 2 You get what you pay for. But OK. 
20748 3 Fits the camera it was recommended for fine. No issues. 
20749 4 I have used a Zomodo system which is really not good; I tried this WIFI NVR System without any high expectation,but so far it is good,outlooking, setting,APP,WIFI signal,service is also prompt.The problem is without ethernet cable which I think should be. 
20750 4 Great! 
20751 3 Great battery however, it would be smart to keep a few extra of these charged up in your bag. 
20752 3 good 
20753 4 Got it in a couple of days and works perfectly! 
20754 1 Don t buy it. It doesn t fit a Nikon as advertised. Spend the extra money and buy a good product. 
20755 4 Very sturdy construction 
20756 2 It s a lens hood. It does the job. While it s made for my lens, the fit feels off, 
20757 0 Died in no time, now I have to go thru hoops to get repaired, very dis-satisfied 
20758 4 Good purchase! Fast shipping! 
20759 4 Great product. 
20760 4 Totally loved this album! It s great quality and holds my pictures perfectly. 
20761 4 Better than I expected 
20762 4 I m happy to have a working camera again, thank you. 
20763 3 Works great for black and white film photography. 
20764 4 This is a present to the world. 
20765 4 great seller - delivered as promised! 
20766 4 Excellent lens. Very handy for street photography. I am keeping it all the time in my OM-D5 I hang around with this one, and my D7100 with the 18-200 on the other shoulder. Great combination. 
20767 4 I had low expectations based on the price, but the quality is quite good, provided the light is good. My only complaint is the Nikon style T-adapter cannot be protected by a Nikon end cap. It fits too loosely and falls off. 
20768 3 Only problem I have is remote. it shows low battery every time and does not working... 
20769 3 Works well once I got the proper macro lens. Product description is coy on that point. 
20770 4 Great pricing and just as I ordered. 
20771 4 Works great with GoPro Hero 4 silver 
20772 3 Use it as protection for my 70-200. Well worth price. 
20773 0 when an e mail is created to try to watch it outside the home, it doesn t let me. 
20774 4 Very sturdy tripod smart looking folds up tor easy carrying 
20775 0 Very handy item. I keep one in the glove box of both cars. I also would recommend the remote timer Hapurs Bluetooth to use with it. 
20776 4 Perfect for our T2i, and quickly shipped. 
20777 3 Works but not designed as good as chums brand version. 
20778 4 Great response from seller. One of the screen had a defect and was replaced quickly by seller. The screen saver works great and is holding up on the watch and minimize scratches on the glass. 
20779 4 Love it! Also have a wireless remote but I like this one better. 
20780 4 batteries perform at least as good as factory originals. No formal testing done though. 
20781 4 very sharp, great on street photography compact & light to carry around 
20782 3 Great bag! Lots of pockets! Wish it wasn t so bulky though! 
20783 4 nice gift 
20784 4 Wonderful product and so darn easy to use! I highly recommend. 
20785 3 light weight tripod stand. wish it was a little bigger. only like four feet high 
20786 4 WORKED AS PROMISED - THANK YOU! 
20787 4 This product totally served the need to which it was applied. We will continue to use the ZINK Photo Paper for our needs, as they occur. Thanks for such a reliable product. 
20788 4 Great 
20789 3 I am very happy with this purchase and it is really valuable addition to my gear. 
20790 4 I lost my Nikon D5300 Charger and I needed one—quick. With prime, shipping was speedy and painless, the company sent a friendly email and the product works most importantly. Much better than buying the $50 Nikon Product. Would recommend to anyone. 
20791 4 very good for the price--as described 
20792 4 I was looking for a case for my Nikon Coolpix S9700 and this one is a perfect fit. 
20793 3 The camera is performing nicely in my home. It sometimes loses its connectivity, but seems to reconnect over time. I held back on giving it 5 stars because of the price for a cloud account and no option to store video on customer hardware. 
20794 4 Very impressed with the USB charge system as compared to the direct charging system. Enjoy the use of product very much. Highly recommending the combination unit for purchase. 
20795 2 Lots of interference if you use as a baby moniter. We needed it for our mother who moved in. So it works ok as an intercom but it s cheaply made and we had to add 100 feet of extra wire. It s what we expected for the money. 
20796 3 Happy with merchandise 
20797 4 Great light ! 
20798 2 This filter paints a purpure sky while shooting on the film. 
20799 3 Great Camera but the GoPro Studio keeps on crashing on me. 
20800 4 works perfect with my video cameras... 
20801 4 Worked like a charm! 
20802 4 Great solid and sturdy lightstand for the price! I have a 4x6 softbox with constant light set up on it in my studio and have had no issues. 
20803 4 very good quality. Has 2 bubble levels to adjust the tripod. Fits my LG PA77U projector well. Good buy! 
20804 3 The product is as advertised, what more can you ask for. 
20805 4 This was one of my best decisions i have ever made. its so cute and the cheepest price on the market. works great and super duper cute! i think everyone should get one. quality is great and a nice fit in the hand. High remarks about this. 
20806 4 Hugely impressed by this product. Serves mainly as a secondary/slave. Excellent performance, nonetheless. 
20807 3 Love the camera, but would have liked the seller to advertise that camera does not have U.S. warranty. 
20808 4 nice! little heavy for dlite 4 
20809 4 Purchased this to cover my hot shoe on the [[ASIN:B00I8BICCG Sony Alpha a6000 Mirrorless Digital Camera - Body only]] I purchased. This is made by Sony as does a fantastic job at protecting the hot shoe since I shoot 100% without flash as a natural light shooter! 
20810 0 camera doesn t work right the picture keep rolling 
20811 0 Don t buy this product!. No connectivity, confirmed with a multimeter. Adds to frustration of getting a camera configured. 
20812 4 works great 
20813 4 My favorite camera... 
20814 4 Excellent product. Thank you!! 
20815 4 Very happy with purchase!!! 
20816 4 Excellent product as to price If you are entering astronomy, this is the right one! But it s extremely hard to colliminate 
20817 4 Thanks... Good product... Fast shipment... 
20818 2 The product is as described and would be fine. However, it does not appear to be very well made as one of the clips was broken on the honeycomb grid and also on one of the color filters. I guess you get what you pay for. 
20819 4 Purchased this to protect my lens and it works perfectly. 
20820 3 these were for my son; I haven t heard any complaints so he must be happy with them! 
20821 3 This camera works pretty good tested it at the pool also at the lake when about 5 feet under water no problem image its pretty good about same as my galaxy s2. 
20822 0 Did not work. Installed battery, LCD screen came on, then nothing would work, not even the light. Returned for refund. Refund was processed quickly and without question. Would purchase from Bopo again, just not from Dot Line Corp. 
20823 4 perfect fit for a Chrome Messenger and a LowePro Slingshot 202 
20824 3 As advertised fit and charges well 
20825 3 Great grip, very comfortable. Only problem I find is the bottom attachment is pretty bulky. Contrary to other posts, you CAN add a neck strap as I ve demonstrated in the photo. It comes with this metal bracket that is designed to add the neck strap to. 
20826 4 This head fits on my Sirui P-424 carbon monopod and can support the weight of my heaviest lens. 
20827 4 A bit pricey for what it is, but that s Canon s fault. Otherwise, it does what it was designed to do. 
20828 0 I found this camera hard to keep connected. Ended up returning. I ve owned 2 other Foscam camera s in the past, but this camera wasn t very reliable. One positive note: the setup was pretty easy. 
20829 3 Good value - picture. 
20830 3 Great Lens, high quality photos, contrasts and color! But taking video s with this lens on the Sony 6000 is very loud, you can hear the motor chattering when it s auto focusing. 
20831 4 easy tu use vert good 
20832 3 Fun, small camera and takes good pictures. 
20833 3 Love B+W I was highly dissapointed that after blowing these off, then wiping carefully with breadth/moisture and a clean microfiber cloth I still had micromarring on the surface. I feel like the glass/foil is incredibly soft in these. 
20834 4 Great for selfies. Easy to put on & take off. 
20835 4 Works perfectly. And I love being able to move it and see it from my cell phone. 
20836 4 Perfect! I charge my original gopro battery and my 2 smatree batteries at the same time! Gets the same battery life for a fraction of the price of original gopro batteries. 
20837 2 it is just ok, nothing special 
20838 4 Thank you 
20839 1 The item is bulky and cumbersome and did not perform to my liking. 
20840 3 Good 
20841 4 Works great 
20842 3 Great lens 
20843 4 Great product, clear, bright images. Definitely worth the price. The case looks pretty resistant to field work. 
20844 2 Enjoy this product, fun to use. 
20845 4 More than just a camera case - I would even use it as a purse. 
20846 4 This is a very nice lens, item was delivered ahead of schedule in a very secure packaging. Lens tested OK Looks good on my GX7 
20847 4 canon eos t3i works great. 
20848 4 Good price and fast shipping 
20849 3 Camera was good but the bag for camera was too small。。。 
20850 3 Great Product 
20851 2 fine 
20852 4 awesome protective case 
20853 4 I m very happy with the performance of these batteries. I bought two, one for each camera. I have a Gopro3 and 3+. 
20854 4 The right tool for the right job 
20855 4 Excellent product for the price, doing everything that I needed it to do. 
20856 4 Best you can get for the price 
20857 4 works great, price is great 
20858 3 Bought for fishing, fits great, the angle isn t great. When dehooking sharks, you see too much ground. Head mount is a better fit for that. 
20859 3 Pleased 
20860 3 was very useful and versatile.[[ASIN:B00PPXGY3O Black Pro Large Octopus Tripod with Adapter Holding 3 Kgs Size 250*60*60mm for Gopro Hero 4 3+ Camera Digital Slrs/dslr/dv]] 
20861 4 Definitely worth it for the money. No issues so far. Using with a Canon 70D. 
20862 4 It is very light weight and plenty sturdy enough for light weight light sources. For the price, it is very well made. 
20863 4 I really enjoy this item. The lighting it gives, out great for my photography. I own two of them. 
20864 3 Great product, exceeds requirements. 
20865 4 Great camera and great customer service from a guy named Kenneth. I was lost and he got me up and running in only a few minutes. 
20866 3 It s not as sturdy as I thought it would be but it s compact and easily fits in a backpack or even pockets. I would not recommend this for &#34;fablets&#34; like the iPhone 6 plus or Notes. 
20867 4 Excellent quality UV filter. I purchased this to go on a Sigma 150-600mm Contemporary lens, and I have not been disappointed. Thee are several less expensive filters out there, but this is worth the extra money. Jeff 
20868 4 gift for my son...he loved it 
20869 4 Works great. A very versatile charger. 
20870 4 This system was for a HS FFA program barn. Install was easy and setup was even easier. Been running for several weeks and it is going great. Can t say enough good about this system and the company that sold it. Great customer service. 
20871 4 Very nice 
20872 4 Very good 
20873 3 Very Good 
20874 4 Tudo ok! 
20875 4 Very nice unit with lots of thing you can do with it. Can t beat the price for such a versatile piece of equipment. Little bit bulky to carry with you. 
20876 4 Good product solves the purpose 
20877 4 Very Good 
20878 4 Great addition to the outside play area of the wife s dog business. Keeps the vandals out at night while providing great visibility to the people that have to do the late night potty break. Well constructed. Bright. Easy install. 
20879 4 work great nice videos, sound, pictures. it did`nt work at first but the memory card went in to far pull it out just a little and it worked fine after that. 
20880 4 Sturdy product and has worked for me on multiple snorkeling trips. 
20881 3 Bought it as a present for my grandma and she love s it. I doesn t have a great resolution but you can t ask more fore the price. Easy to use. 
20882 3 works well with Windows 8. auto crops the photo to perfect size. Instructions on the scanner tell you to insert every photo in the plastic-do so it is easy and gets you the best scan. Just be sure to keep scanning surface clean with tools provided. 
20883 4 Excellent 
20884 2 Battery was cheap. Doesn t hold a charge very long, but wasn t very expensive either. I guess you get what you pay for 
20885 4 These are GREAT. They were plug and play right away. The audio was clear and really worked very well with the filmed presentation. Very worth the investment. 
20886 3 Nice case. Durable. Shipped on time. 
20887 0 Non standard PoE and not advertised in the description of the product: it does not come with its own power supply and PoE injector and Samsung tries to sell its own solution with a recorder that costs a lot and has oownly 4 Ethernet imput adding 4 analog inputs 
20888 3 Got it super fast and I use it everyday. 
20889 2 good! 
20890 0 Very low build quality. Not ready for prime time. Pass on this one. I bought two and they are expensive non-functional paper weights. It s the ptz motor ... It slips when repisitioning rendering it useless. Tech support virtually a joke. 
20891 4 Having a blast with it 
20892 2 Works well but after about a year of use the legs have worn down and causes the monopod to rest on one leg instead of all three. 
20893 4 I m very happy! 
20894 4 Wonderful, I view anywhere and anytime, daytime color very nice , night time with night visions perfect. Easy setup, give me 5 to 10 minutes , I will buy one more set later. Good price Thanks Eyesun Technology Co 
20895 4 Love this bag, Love the colors and it carries nicely on my shoulder. Plus I can carry cross ways and very comfortable. 
20896 4 Great product! 
20897 4 Adorable 
20898 4 Works as described 
20899 4 Excellent value and works well on my Cannon Rebel T5. 
20900 4 Threat 
20901 0 Ordered this two pack as backups for Nikon 1 v1. Neither battery would take a charge they put the charger into an error state ... fast flashing led. Good thing I still have two batteries for the camera. 
20902 4 Thanks D link customer service rep #ER004228. I was in a jam and she went above and beyond in helping me out case#C6723426 
20903 2 Will return these also. Read that props break on occasion and the ad stated that these are also bought with the Parrot Spider, however these are not for the Parrot Spider, much larger. Maybe should have read closer. 
20904 4 Simply perfect, they do what you spect to do 
20905 1 This that is so big !!!! Way big for my Pentax k50. If you what big it was made well. 
20906 4 Beautifully crafted and well designed case. Offers a reasonable amount of protection with decent access to the battery and memory as well as controls. A bit expensive but high quality. 
20907 4 Very good and sturdy. 
20908 4 Great charger. Much better than the stock nikon charger. 
20909 4 Yes 
20910 4 Great little camera.I would recommend this to EVERYONE! 
20911 4 Very impressive for a good price. 
20912 3 Looks to be a good buy for the price. Still learning how to use the camera, but am sure I will enjoy using it with the tripod. 
20913 4 This background paper is just what I needed. Received it quickly. Would recommend to others. 
20914 4 Glad we bought this for our screen 
20915 4 Greatly 
20916 4 Exactly what I was looking for 
20917 2 Product as described, fast shipping, a bit disappointed by the packaging which was minimally protective with respect to the expense and vulnerability of the product. Hoping the lens continues to function as intended. 
20918 4 The Camera is modelF19821W. I was assisted today by Walter. Walter was extremely helpful. 
20919 4 I would buy again. 
20920 4 Works great! Way cheaper than the Sony and has the wireless shutter release and intervalometer. The instructions on how to use the remote are terrible but if you keep at it, it can be figured out! 
20921 4 Fits perfect. For those moments when you dont need the original housing. I use it for most of the time for biking & surrounding sounds. Very happy with it. 
20922 4 Just what I needed. Thanks 
20923 3 Great case, smaller than appeared. But the quality is good and it does the job well. 
20924 0 The film was expired and produced black film. I would not purchase this again. 
20925 4 I was very happy with this iem 
20926 4 I wish this was the stock case that came with the action cams but very pleased with it. 
20927 0 It doesn t work and I cannot get any help from the vendor. It has potential, but there is no contact for help. 
20928 3 just what i expected 
20929 4 Love this , will be buying a couple more 
20930 0 This is a good bag but it does not fit a Nikon D330 and lens as described. 
20931 4 It works. 
20932 4 as described and match my camera perfectly 
20933 4 The picture are very sharp, Camera is made sturdily plus underwater photos are excellent 
20934 4 Package came perfect and fast. Still have to test product though. 
20935 4 Great convenient protection. 
20936 4 I have Qflash T4d and I was not sure if this diffuser is going to fit. It fits well, and I am very satisfied. 
20937 4 Much more convenient than my camera strap. It is comfortable and functional. Don t hesitate. 
20938 4 rock solid, ingenious design... total quality 
20939 1 Very difficult to use 
20940 4 simple, and practice! The pictures show better look after use this flash 
20941 3 Good product for my needs. Some lag in camera rotation, but still very useful for checking the house and pets when away. Very much like the night vision function. 
20942 4 Excellent! 
20943 0 Would not transfer data. 
20944 4 Product was as advertised. 
20945 4 I love this camera. Takes great crisp, clear pictures. This is absolutely worth it! Everything shown in the picture was with the bundle. 
20946 4 like it 
20947 0 cute, but not functional. No memory card included 
20948 1 Good camera, but not very practical and too heavy for me. I thought it was lighter to carry around. I wonder if I could exchange it. 
20949 4 good! 
20950 1 I don t use it because it is oddly shaped and I can t really fit anything in it. 
20951 4 Easy for setup and not expensive I like it 
20952 0 Received an envelope with no 0 screen protector. 
20953 4 I had lost my original cable and have still not found it. This one is an exact replacement. 
20954 4 finally can use my land camera with out modifying it, will buy again. 
20955 4 All ok 
20956 2 The head is not that smooth and the legs are not connected together. It is a sturdy stand for static shots but not for action or sports. 
20957 3 Good but the 910 turns out to be a little smaller than what I needed. Kept it anyway. 
20958 0 It is what it is 
20959 4 Awesome little camera. For hundreds less than the GP it s hard to beat! 
20960 4 Despite the fact I took me a while to figure out how to install the lens hood (operator error), the product itself is great. It does what it s suppose to do for a great price. 
20961 0 The digital picture frame will not turn me get damaged 
20962 4 Sturdy and compact with all the essential features. 
20963 4 GREAT 
20964 4 These were just the ticket for replacing a scratched lens. Fit well, and were easy to install. 
20965 0 It s description of the cord it will not work for ps3 or Xbox 
20966 3 Nice gels, but took a long time to get here (Chicago area). 
20967 1 Really nice but really hard to fly. 
20968 4 If you have a Gopro hero camera and don t have a case, this is well worth the money. 
20969 4 Perfect data transfer! Fair price. 
20970 4 Very cool to wear and awesome POV shots 
20971 4 Henry was the best 
20972 4 I am very pleased with the slide viewer and it came in very soon after it was ordered. 
20973 4 The best in price and quality. 
20974 4 Good..... 
20975 4 Great portable light modifier. Built well enough. Works as I expected. Great item. 
20976 0 sometimes working sometimes don t 
20977 3 I thought you could take pictures w/o removing it from case. Nope. But it will definitely protect the camera!!! 
20978 2 First time using it and the strap fell off, thankfully I didn t lose my go-pro. 
20979 4 Great. 
20980 4 What I really like about this backdrop is how flat it stores. Bigger than I expected tall/wide (a good thing i guess for backdrops) Those black things are heavy weights that work well. It comes ready to go, pretty simple to use. (I m a guy who never reads directions) 
20981 3 I haven t had the camera long but it has met all my expectations and then some. I am especially thrilled to have the 55-200mm lens which allows me to take up close photos of nature. I am very happy so far with the camera. 
20982 4 no surprise 
20983 4 Christmas gift, my wife loved it. 
20984 4 I love my camera. I need to learn more about it 
20985 4 Have had it for a month or so. Received it fast. Loaded all sorts of pictures (around 2000 portrait and landscape oriented pictures) in the supplied USB flash drive. No issues. Works great, picture is great, motion sensor is great.. No complaints. 
20986 4 Excellent binocs. Shipping speed was good. 
20987 4 Love this selfie stick I wasn t a big fan of it but now I can take family pics all by myself it s nice and small fits anywhere n very cute 
20988 3 Happy with this buy 
20989 3 Great camera, easy to use and set up. I linked it to my home wifi and can email the pictures directly to myself from the camera super easy! Takes great pictures 
20990 0 First time using these, the Phantom 3 was extremely unstable. Even after calibration before the flight, the drone was out of control, and crash into my car. Sent an email to DJI, but they did not respond. Beware before you try these. 
20991 4 excellent!!! 
20992 3 good, shipping fast 
20993 2 Happy with the camera. For a used camera it easy replaces the one that I lost.. Working condition, etc. perfect. Thank you 
20994 4 This was bought for my daughters birthday. We found the GoPro Hero 3 to be everything the write up said it would do. The package came packed secure and in a timely manner. Not only did it work great at the pool party but survived a group of amateur photographers. 
20995 4 Great camera, but the accessories tossed in are mediocre at best. The Flash is crap and the tripod is flimsy, I sure wouldn t trust it for my new Nikon that for sure. Still, not a bad deal when I bought it a few months ago. 
20996 4 great way to carry around some extra memory caards 
20997 2 Pretty average camera, but it works 
20998 4 One of the best for all those looking for a case for their heady glass or anything really. It has the pick and pluck float so you can fit litterally anything that can fit in the box 10/10 
20999 4 All the accessories are great! Love them all! So glad I got it! The monopod is the best feature by far! 
21000 1 Although the item seems to &#34;work&#34;, it has very poor sensitivity. It can alarm of movement if the moving person or object is within about 15 feet or less of the detector. It of limited use for most applications or driveways. 
21001 0 Poor fit in the D750. A bit too large and could not clear space below protector at two corners. Should be a bit smaller, the Vello was much better. 
21002 4 Works as it should. Nice strong clasp, doesn t fall off 
21003 2 Wasn t as expected.. very disapointed. Couldn t read the instructions because they weren t in English to figure out how to work it. Didn t come with any film either... bummer. 
21004 4 Work perfectly fine with my 1D MKIII. No issues. 
21005 3 Good product, quality and appearance 
21006 4 Freaking Fantastic! 
21007 4 Have been using this for a while and have had no issues. No bubbles...Great protection. 
21008 2 How do you possibly make sense of all this neewer stuff. You buy the bulb but didn t get the light. you didn t get the diffuser. the diffuser comes in 4 colors. why? 
21009 4 So happy with it. It s perfect 
21010 4 Good 
21011 4 Product is self explainable. Just make sure you measure before ordering this way you don t have to roll up 30 feet of wire. 
21012 4 Good Quality product! Heavy duty, easy to use, sturdy. I m extremely HAPPY with my purchase!~DUG 
21013 4 Excellent value. Works great with my Nikon P610. Light and sturdy. Very compact. 
21014 0 Tippy and very cheaply made 
21015 0 did not work at all - 
21016 0 The straps ripped almost immediately. 
21017 4 I ve had other lens adapters, and they were awkward fitting and using. Not the case with this. I bought it to use my Minolta lenses on my Sony A3000. It goes on easily, and swapping lenses is fast and easy as well. It s a joy to use! 
21018 4 beautiful picture quality. Takes stunning macro images and can be used as a telescoping lens in a pinch. Highly recommended for any serious or armature photographer. I m rather armature but have included an example pic of one my dart frogs. 
21019 2 The sleeves work, but I would like it if they fit the film a little bit more snugly. 
21020 4 Perfect ... as it supposed to be !! 
21021 4 good start. good price with lots of accessories. light weight, easy to take. 
21022 4 came on time was what I expected 
21023 4 I bought this thinking my used camera would be sent with out a battery. But always can use fresh ones. 
21024 4 Fit my alarm system, came in a plain box. Could careless about the box, batteries work and family is once again protected. 
21025 4 excelente 
21026 4 For holding it does good for when doing a lot of shots. Does not feel safe for walking around. 
21027 4 Bulky but offers a nice blast of air - better than those little grey blowers. 
21028 0 Although the battery is listed as a replacement for the Panasonic original it the camera rejected it since it was not an original Panasonic product. Check out the web for the exact issue. Do not buy this battery! It fits but does not function. 
21029 0 Did not fit.. 
21030 4 Unobtrusive and effective. They break now and then, but for the price and simplicity you can replace it and go on your way. [[ASIN:B00IP22A08 5pcs Anti-lost Lens Cover Cap Keeper Lanyard Keeper Holder Strap Rope for Sony Olympus Canon Nikon Dslr SLR Camera]] 
21031 0 Don t. Buy this it s a. Lie I looked and. It said it was compatible with my camera. And it didn t fit. It s like I threw. A few. Dollars. Down the street 
21032 4 Came in less than a week! The rig is about what you d expect for the price. Nice and basic! 
21033 0 The slide scans are way off color. Kodachrome negatives cannot be scanned to make a useful digital negative or positive. 
21034 4 Good 
21035 4 The size and weight all work well with my Rebel T51. Since purchasing and using it has added another dimension of quality to my photos. A must have. 
21036 2 It is a bit flimsy but does the job. What I expected from Polaroid. =) 
21037 3 The arm is solid. The tripod that s inside the handle...come gopro you could ve done better. Very flimsy plastic! 
21038 0 GoPro does not support warrentees if you buy from Amazon. Don t do it. 
21039 4 good product 
21040 4 Fits perfect.....great price. 
21041 4 I have owned this for 2 years and it is still in great condition. Depending on what you re doing you may want a higher quality/more versatile tripod. This one is great for an ameture photographer. 
21042 4 Great lens, very sharp and great focus. Great deal, especially for the price. 
21043 4 Still love the D5200... even since I left it on a train in Berlin within a month of purchase! Let me know if you re the one who found it :•( 
21044 4 I love that the power if built into the cat5 cable! I bough extra cable, however it wasn t needed. this kit had what I needed. The app is fairly solid! 
21045 3 This is an excellent value for a water white filter. I haven t experienced any issues with flare, and its color reproduction is far better than you d normally get for the price. 
21046 4 Oh, very good camera, feels like built with good materials. Small size, quick & clear focusing, photos better than my other digital camera. Love it. 
21047 4 Work out well 
21048 4 Loved it. Easy to learn and use especially if you are just learning how to work it. It is also good for beginners such as myself. 
21049 0 Wouldn t hold a charge and cost as much to return as paid for. 
21050 4 No issues here. 
21051 4 This GoPro handle really makes it much easier to get different angles and shoot more interesting clips. It floats so enables you to take underwater video without someone holding the camera. The strap helps a lot to allow movement without losing the GoPro if you are in the ocean. 
21052 0 The package was opened when it arrived and the screws were not the right size at all! 
21053 0 Sucks!! no way to secure to rail!!!!! 
21054 4 Great Items 
21055 3 It works as it should, despite being flimsier than more expensive brands. It does it s job. 
21056 0 lens fell out on first use, and casing became chipped immediately. Very poor quality item. No response from seller beyond requesting photos, which I provided repeatedly. Very disappointed. 
21057 4 excellent 
21058 4 YOU JUST CAN T BEAT THE PRICE AND HOLD S A CHARGE...HAPPY WITH PURCHASE.. 
21059 4 Product arrived on time and was exactly as described. Have only used them around neighborhood but have worked perfectly. Will be using them in the field in 2 weeks 
21060 0 This battery was about 1/16 inch shorter than the original 504 is was to replace. Waste of money. 
21061 4 i love it...as expected 
21062 4 Product was exactly as described and at a great price and very fast delivery !!! Will be back to this sellers page !!! 
21063 3 Worked exactly as described, and easier to use than expected. 
21064 4 These 1600 mah batteries last longer per use than Kodak s KLIC-7004 at 1000 mah Charger works well. Have used these batteries for about month. 1/17 Batteries continue to work well. Have gone over to Kodak charger. 
21065 0 Fat chance getting license plates or facial features. Too blurry.... 
21066 3 Works keeps it aflote 
21067 4 just sold this housing to a friend and upgraded to the same one but for the canon d5 mark iii, i love ikelite and they make a great product. amazing lighting products as well. well worth the investment1 
21068 4 small, durable, gets the job done. Highly recommended 
21069 2 Sometimes it is difficult to get the camera leveled, but in general it is a good product. 
21070 3 Arrived in great condition. 
21071 4 Good batteries, great value. Highly recommended. 
21072 4 Fast service and a true fit. Service is the key they have the products and system down pat..... 
21073 4 Well made and worth the money..... 
21074 4 Got a clean sensor on my Canon 30D now. 
21075 3 Wish the price for storage was 1/2 of what s being charged. Too rich for my blood. 
21076 4 Easy to install, work great. One had issues and replacement was very easy. 
21077 4 Excellent 
21078 4 Love this Lens. Color came out to be very good. 
21079 4 Works great 
21080 4 Fits great and works amazing. Sure, if you have time to set up there are light modifiers that will do a better a job but if you are shooting an event where things change too fast to allow for set up this does the trick nicely. 
21081 4 OK 
21082 4 purchase 2 of these for other deputies. I finally got one for my self I recommend it to all LEO s works great. 
21083 0 Unit worked once then quit working. New egg and manufacturer FAILED TO refund or replace defective product after many requests. New egg passed responsibility to CHINA company who has not refunded for product. RIP OFFS 
21084 3 I am using this case to hold my Pentax K-50 DSLR camera and it keeps the camera well protected; the small additional compartments can hold other accessories like batteries and battery charger and memory cards, etc. 
21085 0 Don t waste your money, time and frustration level. It s not worth it! 
21086 3 Works! 
21087 4 thanks 
21088 0 Complete junk 
21089 2 Its a cool little extra to have around but I wish it wasn t plastic, 
21090 0 Remote does not work for my Canon 60d 
21091 4 Very nice backdrop. 
21092 4 Perfect! Love it! 
21093 0 Strap won t fit through the loop on my Panasonic Lumix GF-3. Too wide. No instructions. Had to go to Youtube to see how to put it together. 
21094 4 works great 
21095 4 Exactly what I needed and workes great! 
21096 4 Nice 
21097 4 This little device is great. Works extremely well, and with the addition of the bush cover makes my confidence in the cleanliness of ly lens cleaning. 
21098 4 This works perfectly and better than expected. It gives me peace of mind! 
21099 4 Fit perfect lasts a lot longer than the factory battery. 
21100 4 Have not been able to use it yet, husband said it looks good 
21101 4 good 
21102 2 Okay 
21103 4 Excellent!....Just what I wanted! 
21104 4 Met my expectations and then some. I recommend. 
21105 0 i am having trouble setting them up they shut my internet down when i try to connect them i have conntacted seller and they will not contact me back 
21106 4 A very nice battery for my Panasonic Lumix FZ70. 
21107 4 Works well at cleaning the smudges off my glasses. Great value for a family like mine with many glasses in the house. 
21108 4 Really nice. Downloaded the instruction book on my tablet. Better than booklet. Not heavy either even with batteries. Love the color. 
21109 4 Easy to use and the instruction are easy. They are written in a conversational way that is easy to understand. 
21110 4 Perfect! I also bought the wrist strap so that I could swap according to the activity I am photographing. 
21111 4 works as it should. 
21112 0 Not at all what I wanted. Ordered wireless!! 
21113 4 Awesome value and works great. No issues so far. 
21114 4 very good 
21115 4 good lens cap bundle from CamKix. 
21116 4 It is great for all day shooting and is extremely easy, comfortable and convenient. 
21117 4 Great lens, great seller! 
21118 3 Good 
21119 4 Great lens for the price and it suited my needs using my Canon 70D and my 50D 
21120 4 This was a great deal on two batteries, charger and 220v adapter. I had to go elsewhere to get the Camera (Nikon 610), it was $100 cheaper at 42 street photo. 
21121 4 Works as represented 
21122 3 Binoculars are great. Able to focus quite close and far distant with clarity. Binoculars would get a 5-star from me except for lens caps that too easily come off. 
21123 4 This lens has made a sigma fan out of me. I had an older model of this on a Canon, was good but not great. This new model is much sharper, it stays on the Pentax body now. 
21124 1 It is to dark, and the night vision is useless!! 
21125 0 im not sure how long these worked for but very unpredictable. 
21126 4 Great fit and very easy to put on. 
21127 3 Little expensive 
21128 2 Its OK. Works. 
21129 4 great little camera!!!! i d buy it again. 
21130 0 Terrible quality 
21131 1 Sent it back. Not exactly what I was looking for 
21132 4 Works great. 
21133 4 Woah, this thing is awesome! It could light an entire room with it being the only light source. However it does come with a dimmer so you are not sliding all your subjects. 
21134 0 What app do I download 
21135 4 Just exactly what was needed. 
21136 0 I expected these to fit the op/tech camera harness. They did not mate 
21137 4 Fantastic camera and I will learn more as I go,, still reading and playing around with it 
21138 3 Item as described works with nikon d5500 
21139 4 Arrived as ordered, works fine. I ve been using SterlinkTek for years - great products at great prices 
21140 0 There is no way to attach the gopro to the chest strap. I think you will need to have a case that houses the gopro and snaps into the chest start. I wish the description stated that. 
21141 4 Exactly as expected. 
21142 4 Exactly what I expected. It charges superfast and lasts long. 
21143 1 Having a case that separated into two pieces and you have to take one off (and hold it) every time you want to take a photo is really annoying. 
21144 0 Not for iPhone 6+ 
21145 4 As described, works great. 
21146 4 Fun camera, worked under water in Hawaii with great video and pictures. 
21147 3 IS A GOOD CASE 
21148 4 This product exceeded my expectations. I m going to test it underwater this weekend during my dive 
21149 4 Great product for the price. I would recommend this polarizer anytime. 
21150 4 Caught my crazy neighbor and daughter keying my wife s car. Happen at 3:00 am night vision was crystal clear. 
21151 4 it s alright 
21152 4 It s okay, but not what I expected 
21153 0 Goes off line a lot and you cannot access camera from WiFi locations...I m very disappointed with this product. 
21154 4 Love it so much! 
21155 0 Didn t work, turned on then off. Instructions were terrible not very helpful at all 
21156 4 I m glad I bought this instead of the Canon brand! The price is excellent and it fits really well. Highly recommended for canon 70-200mm F4 IS. 
21157 3 This was a replacement for the identical camera that somehow quit working properly...........we chose to replace with the warrantee rather than repair for $125. 
21158 4 important warranty plan if you re a vlogger who might be prone to breaking things! 
21159 4 Oh so wonderful and functional... I love all the compartments! I ve used it for two weddings so far... It s great for carrying an extra lens or two. 
21160 3 The GPS seems to work reasonably well. Photos have come out quite nicely. Easy to use. Have yet to figure out how to sync with my iPhone which is why I ve not given 5-stars. Have tried on several occasions but haven t hit upon the correct sequence yet. 
21161 2 They called large but its not that large, i have to leave out some of my equipment. at least is well made. wished was a little cheaper because is a amazon basics product. 
21162 2 This camera is very average, if you wanting to buy this for less money buy the Vivotek version rather than the Cisco one. 
21163 2 I wanted the protection that the case offer, and for the most part I am satisfied with it, but it makes it difficult to get the memory card out of the camera and does not offer as much coverage on the sides of the camera as I had hoped. 
21164 4 product was as described, great quality 
21165 2 Really expensive for what it is. 
21166 2 great quality but expensive 
21167 3 it was very usefull and handy 
21168 4 Quick delivery and fit my camera perfectly! I always lose these so I m sure I ll be ordering more soon! 
21169 4 Love it. Easy set up. Great quality. 
21170 3 very good product. excellent quality 
21171 3 works great, just missed the fact that a spare battery wasn t included. 
21172 2 It works pretty well but some of the hardware is not the greatest I had a substitute a different stand bracket for the one that came with the clamp 
21173 4 Works perfectly, better then I had anticipated 
21174 4 I bought this for my husband and he was delighted! 
21175 4 It fits well and stays on the Sony Nex 7. 
21176 3 Was pleasantly surprised. Used on vacation. No problems yet. 
21177 4 Fast delivery and wonderful inexpensive product! 
21178 1 Only one of the batteries worked. The other didn t fit the charger 
21179 4 Outstanding Item and fast shipping. 
21180 0 don t work 
21181 0 The product fits too loosely. Lens does not click into adapter and adapter doesn t click to camera body. Slight wobble is enough to throw picture quality off. 
21182 4 Really great accessory to have when biking or attaching my GoPro to my motorcycle helmet, the laws of physics and mother nature may come into play. 
21183 0 It would have been very cute, however, it never actually arrived. 
21184 4 best price 
21185 2 handle broke within the first week 
21186 4 Great item for the price, can t wait to use it! 
21187 1 Not including the holder 
21188 4 Carl was a great help to me as I was setting up my camera. The camera does exactly as expected. Perfect for what I needed and with a little help setting it up, it was a breeze. 
21189 4 Excellents 
21190 4 Bought the imposter, now I ve got factory battery! 
21191 4 Quality Product. Looks Kool. 
21192 4 So far the camera is great, The only problem I have found is the the on/off button is easy to push while tring to zoom in or out. Just something I will have to get use to. But love everything else about the camera. 
21193 0 needs 120V power not battery operated 
21194 0 I, unfortunately, had a bad experience with this item: 1) Installed software update 2) Shut down the camera 3) Camera started to over heat 4) Opened the case to access the camera and removed the battery 5) Noticed that the top right corner had cracked 
21195 4 Good value. 
21196 4 Highly Recommended! 
21197 4 High quality strap. Too bad Carry Speed products are not sold in the USA. 
21198 4 Great deal, easy to use. Product does the job! 
21199 4 Great deal worth fast shipping. Good company to deal with. Very happy. 
21200 4 Just the right size for my Fujinon XF 55-200mm lens. 
21201 1 Did not fit to my Sony cam 
21202 4 This baby is definitely going to be my go-to handle for the GoPro (especially as more and more places are banning selfie sticks). Love this baby, feels good, floats, and allows me to get the videos I want. 
21203 4 Great little camera, really like the inline, not offset, lens. Very rugged has now hit the ground in a couple hard crashes while on my 250 FPV quadcopter. A couple dents i the case but, still working! For the money very hard to beat. 
21204 4 Dany did an outstanding job being patient with me. The camara is very good. 
21205 3 The cameras are very easy to install. I found that they required about a day to get solid signals and work out the bugs but after that they work flawlessly inside and out. I do wish they had audio because everything else works so well... 
21206 1 one of the clips fails and for that the right strap of the bag pack works improperly. The product feels cheap. 
21207 0 The earphone jack is not a tight fit for the gateway S5. I could only get it to work if I held the earphone jack connection in and then what s the point of the stick. 
21208 0 Contacted them - no reply.. Doesn t work & it is faulty. 
21209 0 Has a limited range and it did not work with my wireless network. 
21210 3 great shipper and quality 
21211 4 This pod has worked great so far. It has always kept its shape and is very flexible. The level on top is a great addition and I like the quick release mount for the gopro, or other camera. It does seem a little bulky though. 
21212 4 Great camera 
21213 4 I love this camera; so easy, great pictures and great price!!! Thanks!!! 
21214 4 This bag is well built and well padded. I could pack D 9 attached with Tokina 11- 17 mm lens, 1 nikon 18- 105 mm , 1 sigma 18- 250 mm macro hsn, and 1 nikon prime lenses. Looks small but with enough room 
21215 4 Cannot beat the price! Works great. I use three of these for wedding photography 
21216 3 Not quite so sturdy as expected. No instructions on how to convert to monopod, but after a while figured it out. Well made with minimum plastic parts. 
21217 4 Great value and great performing product. 
21218 4 sturdy but a little heavy 
21219 4 Vincent was the most intelligent, helpful Tech I ve worked with at Foscam. He quickly solved all issues and even suggested and helped me set remote settings, which nobody ever offered to help with before. He s really great! Thanks! 
21220 1 Image is ok Smartphone works ok Cannot upgrade firmware Image don t show at PC software 
21221 3 Great deal and it works great. Its so nice to not have to rely on one GoPro battery 
21222 4 Great 
21223 4 Great 
21224 3 I really liked the binoculars. It was a little tough getting them to adjust. Great buy, though. 
21225 4 Nice travel tripod for the price. Easy to setup, already took sample pictures and movies. Looking forward to Hawaii in less than three weeks. Mahalo! 
21226 4 Works perfectly and a fraction of the price Canon charges. 
21227 3 Great lense, fast shipping and love the accessories, except the bag is so small and useless! I can only fit my camera body in it. It looks totally different from the picture 
21228 4 Love the items. They work wonderful and fit great. Use on our trip to Ireland and was thrilled with all of them. Would order again in a second. Thanks for a great product! 
21229 4 Bigger than expected holds up great 
21230 4 Great group of accessories if you have a gopro 
21231 1 Just ordered and can t use it till I update it on my computer. Such a pain after getting the app and registering my son can t even fly it. 
21232 4 What can I say, It is a plug, it fit my battery charger. What else can I say about a power cord. 
21233 4 Present for sson He really likes it. 
21234 3 Works very well 
21235 4 That coil is a nice i almost make 15 tattoo and my liner machine run good no heat. 
21236 3 it is good. 
21237 3 The camera works fine, but the barrel of one of them will not unscrew, so the memory cannot be added. The replacement and three others work fine. 
21238 3 Mounted to an older Nikon 300/f2.8 so it can be quickly mounted to an Arca style QR. The anti-rotation flange is ideal for preventing possible movement of the shoe. 
21239 2 Not super high quality. I got it for watching netflix in bed - so I can lay on my side and put the screen at about a 45-degree angle to match my eyes. It tips over even with an iPhone 5 at that angle. 
21240 1 Female screw at the end has no thread..... What the.... I had to use my original screws from other adapter to hold the camera onto this grip. 
21241 4 very good , solid thumbscrew better than the plastic 
21242 4 Great value for the money and super quick shipment. Buy with confidence! 
21243 2 Great camera but not upgradeable to this day and age, to slow must be an old model. 
21244 1 Quality looking blades, but dangerous! These things are very stiff and could take your fingers off no problem! After a tip-over one blade embedded itself in the arm of my quad. And the lifting ability is much less than my original blades. 
21245 4 :) 
21246 4 I flew to NYC to photograph a wedding. These got the job done well and worked as carry-on luggage. Very light and easy to carry. 
21247 0 Very economical camera for the price. But not happy that the waterproof case was scratched up. Not able to have a clear video due to the scratches. Need to sell this accessory separately. 
21248 4 High quality and good to have extras. 
21249 0 Out of the package it didn t work 😠 
21250 0 Utterly underwhelmed. For the price, this camera is uninspired and heavily sand-bagged. Switching to A7Rii 
21251 1 Lint magnet! 
21252 4 Nice , cheap backup camera... 
21253 4 LOOVEEE IT so much! 
21254 4 Great replacements for the original! 
21255 4 Great! Works perfectly 
21256 4 Works great...;love it 
21257 3 so far so good 
21258 4 great 
21259 2 no good, go for phottix pls 
21260 2 For a starter its a good product and yes the stand is shaky as written by others. Overall its a good product in such a price 
21261 4 it fits good 
21262 2 Ok so i bought these because sony charges too much. The batteries work fine for average use. However if you need a battery to last as long as the sony one that the camera came with, I would not buy these. Just pay the extra money. 
21263 4 excellent telephone service from Walter relatively short wait time - wait time has been better in the past 
21264 3 Delivered on time and what a great product. All metal light weight body but heavy duty enough to handle the big jobs. It could have been a little taller but hence the 4 stars. 
21265 4 Works great thank you 
21266 4 Awesome unit. Great value. Works perfectly as described. Very handy on shoots! 
21267 4 Henry from customer service was incredible. He resolved my issues with my cameras both at my site and my remote site. Very satisfied with my cameras and Foscam 
21268 4 Great product easy to use, works as designed. 
21269 3 glad to find film for a special project 
21270 3 Great Value! 
21271 4 I love this camera and would not change it for the world. The customer service provided to me by Walter was professional and unrushed. It was perfect service and support. 
21272 4 Yhe dogs aren t happy. 
21273 4 I am an amateur, but I love photography. I now have a lens that gives me the ability to get great Micro shots. I love it, and I got it in 2 days. Bonus!! 
21274 4 Don t think, just buy. This camera is good enough to pay itself off with the freelance work it can create. 
21275 4 works great! used it on hard hats and sports caps, not too irritating on the head as well. 
21276 4 I use these batteries almost everyday. The original set I purchased is still going strong after 2years of continuous use. Added another camera to the setup and came right back to the same spot for batteries. Couldn t be happier. 
21277 3 functions as described. Additional memory is helpful for larger application. Requires some circuit reconfiguration to accommodate the lower board voltage. 
21278 4 It works fine. but the button is not soft like the camera of course. 
21279 4 best for prise!!! 
21280 4 thank you 
21281 4 cheap and effective 
21282 3 Nice, for light (not heavy) work. A little weak in the construction area...but for the price, an OK value. Easy to use and LOVE the portability. 
21283 2 I use these with my Smart Things system and it works pretty good. I ve noticed it misses quite a few motions. I m not super confident it is ability to pick up motion at the first past but eventually it sounds after a number of passes... 
21284 2 complicated as hell, instructions in googled english from chinese 
21285 0 the class was loose in the ring... rattled something horrible 
21286 4 Easy to setup, phone/pc controllable camera, works as expected 
21287 4 Great service. Great product 
21288 3 rec d as promised and as advertised 
21289 4 I still don t understand my first DSLR, but I ve already made magic with it. I m use to point and shoot cameras and almost DSLRs. I can t wait to learn how to use it properly, but once I learned to focus it, worked like clockwork. 
21290 2 I like it, but I hardly use this. it is too bulky to use as a transportable piece. It would be nice if I was stationary and left it up. But if that happened I would just build a wall. 
21291 4 I love the color, and the pictures are great! The product arrived quickly and just as stated. I am very happy with my purchase. 
21292 4 Good deal!!!! 
21293 4 What is not to love about instant photographs. All of the kids in 5th grade LOVE my &#34;old fashioned&#34; camera! 
21294 3 Only one worked ... Oh Well ... both took the charge but camera will not identify one of the batteries. Not the sellers fault. This has happen before so I chalk it up to the camera manuf. being propietary 
21295 4 Love this product. I have one in my car for my electronics and one in my house. Glad I have this as a safe way to clean my glasses, phone, and tablet. 
21296 4 Nice case. Phantom 3 and lots of extras fit perfectly. 
21297 4 Arrived on time with all accessories...everything just as promised. What an amazing drone, this technology has reached a remarkable price point for the capability and this seller will deliver. 
21298 0 I don t get the positive reviews. These are garbage. They last one week tops in a bark collar. 
21299 3 Very tough case. Traveled to Maui with no issues. Some of the comments said, that it comes with flash drives, but thats all lies. Its ONLY the case. 
21300 1 Didn t trust it to hold my expensive dslr, I ended up putting it on a smaller mirrorless instead. Even on this camera it cuts off circulation and is too tight. 
21301 4 Easy on screen protection 
21302 0 It broke at the foot right upon opening of package. And I m afraid to open the second package. :( What a disappointment. 
21303 4 Easy to install and configure the system. Worth the money. 
21304 3 Really helped alot 
21305 4 It works great and i love how the price was low but good dvr 
21306 4 excelente 
21307 4 Great Price, Fast Shipping 
21308 3 This Nikon lense does an outstanding job of capturing those long and difficult shots! 
21309 4 nice adapter and easy to set up 
21310 4 Fulfilling all expectations, very happy with the choice. 
21311 4 Got this for my daughter who loves it. Perfect for her Fugi film Instax photos. 
21312 2 Lights get dangerously hot way too fast. 
21313 4 Works really well. Accurately charges and doesn t overcharge. I don t have many charging at the same time, but it seems to work brilliantly 
21314 4 High quality good fit fair price good delivery 
21315 2 Hello, my only complaint has been that the dvr has stopped working after 7 months. Cannot find out if there is a warranty. 
21316 2 I used it during couple of my treks, outdoor shoots etc and its a great tool to protect your camera from rain, dust and snow. After some heavy use, some of the joints tore off. But its still usable. 
21317 4 Great alternative for the Nikon EN-EL4A that costs a lot more. The charge holds well over multiple cycles, which is a concern with aftermarket batteries. The full coding is good for battery metering. 
21318 4 works in my Lumix. Hope it lasts as long as the Panasonics. Seems to have high rating among many users. Sweet. 
21319 4 Just like a OEM charger. At a good price. And it charges quick. 
21320 4 The handle is light and really well made. The strap has a nice buckle which allows you to cinch the strap to minimize the chance of it coming off. Overall great quality and I highly recommend. 
21321 4 This pack has everything you d need at a really great price. Wish the case was a little bigger to hold everything it comes with but all in all a great package 
21322 2 Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles. 
21323 4 Great 
21324 1 it broke when tightened. 
21325 2 Great camera in good lighting, not so good at night. Over all not bad for the price. 
21326 4 very clear & great 
21327 0 This needs to 0 stars. This cable did not work at all. I have been busy and I need to find out how to return it. It was supposed to fit this camera. 
21328 0 Camera and accessories are great. But I m still waiting for the original Nikon camera manual. I won t buy from Al s in the future. 
21329 4 love it! 
21330 4 love the remote 
21331 0 This clearly states it s a 2 pack and we only received one! 
21332 4 Works great!!! This selfie stick is so easy to use. It works great with my iPhone 5 and it holds the phone tightly in place. It is made of good material and looks durable. Love using this selfie stick with family and friends. 
21333 4 Works like a charm and fits my battery. Exactly what I ordered. 
21334 4 A+ 
21335 4 Awesome, awesome, awesome my daughter loves it n takes everywhere, get the back door before going to the beach with it, better safe then sorry 
21336 0 very disappointed camera not showing cheaper cameras a showing better and as a professional installer i was very shocked not 850 TVL very blurry 
21337 2 The camera takes good pictures, but i am disappointed it does not have red-eye control, or control for shaky hands. My last Canon had both features 
21338 4 This is a pretty decent camera actually for the money! Very clear video and easy to use interface... It s not perfect but for the money I can t ask for more. 
21339 4 I ll never lose my camera lens cap again! 
21340 4 It s been over two years and still works perfectly even after I peeled it up and repositioned it 5 times. Battery died once. Only sad aspect is you can t change the tone length. Beeps 3 times for probably 4-5 seconds. 
21341 4 Would buy again 
21342 4 Ok 
21343 4 Awesome 
21344 4 I love this bag! It s light, fits my laptop has room for other stuff and travels great! 
21345 4 works as advertised. 
21346 4 I like this tool....glad to see that this cardboard technology is still used.. 
21347 4 Best sound ive heard after trying a few different mics. 
21348 4 Love this, and the fact it has multiple uses. I ve used it with my camera, and my microphone. Works great and is really stable and flexible. 
21349 4 Great accessory. Very strong lamp mount, will not go anywhere. 
21350 4 I m very proud of these items. These items arrived just in time as expected; I m very proud of them. 
21351 4 this product is just the right tool to eliminate the hard light on faces, I tried it with my little girl and they were able to handle the brightness. it is difficult to set it up on the LED light, but nothing that some Sticky backs can t handle. 
21352 2 They would have been nice if the collimation had been correct. I ended up getting the &#34;Nikon 7238 Action Ex Extreme 8 X 40 mm&#34; and I have been happy with them. 
21353 3 buy for a friend 
21354 4 Gets used every day at work. Easy point and shoot, or you can take movies. 
21355 0 Horrible design. Too short (I m 6&#34; feet tall) and the loops kept catching on my shirt everytime I pulled the camera up. 
21356 3 Works great. It is a little heavy. 
21357 3 Price was great and batteries are holding charge just fine. 
21358 2 Its cheap and nothing extraordinary about this. you get what you pay for.. which is mediocre 
21359 4 great set up in bag with &#34;cleaning&#34; sticker, and protector x2 and a large micro fiber cloth. good value, does the job. 
21360 3 Woks great with the camera. 
21361 4 this offers some really interesting perspectives. I use it with my telephoto lens. Tip: great for take large group selfies!!!! 
21362 0 took horrible pictures when it did work...most the time it wouldn t come on. 
21363 4 Excellent product. 
21364 4 I have bought Wasabi batteries for several cameras and I have never had a problem. They work just as well as the name brand, but cost much less. The included charger with international and car adapters is a nice plus too. 
21365 4 Just got - took about 10 minutes to setup, looks better than pics, good price, smooth operation, easy to use and pic quality is also good. If anything changes - will surely update this review. Thanks [owned it for only an hour] 
21366 4 A lot stronger than the case that came with it. 
21367 4 I loved this purchase. Seriously great quality items for a great price! AVAWO is where its going down!! 
21368 4 Yaaaaaaaaas, blows dust away from my sensor. My images are happy :) 
21369 4 This was just what I was looking for to replace old DVR. Works great. Had a small issue with viewing on phone but customer service talked me through it in a few minutes. 
21370 1 Never used it under water, the pictures are blurry on land what would it look like under water.. 
21371 4 Excellent, good prices and shipping time was quik, 
21372 4 This is a really great trialed for the price. Very easy to set up. Already enjoying it on my deck. Great company, shipped fast and safe. Would highly recommend. 
21373 4 product delivered as promised product as explained in description no problem 
21374 4 Awesome 
21375 4 I think it has all been said. I know of no downside to this lens. 
21376 4 Bought this for my dad and he loves it. It was easy to set up and he likes the remote control options. He shows this off whenever he has guests! 
21377 2 You get what you pay for.. mount secures well but materials are what you would expect for price. Even after securing screw better the hinge still has some play that will wobble on rough terrain. 
21378 4 Great Camera, good video quality, awesome accessories, exceptional value! 
21379 4 I love this funky camera. It takes flattering photos of people with its slightly soft focus and vintage tint. 
21380 3 the tripod works great but was damaged in shipping would buy again but from a different supplier 
21381 4 Camera came as advertised...like new...with a quick delivery turn around time 
21382 3 as described 
21383 3 Nice for the price and simple to set up. 
21384 0 don t buy it trust me. Waste of time and money!!! 
21385 0 I just purchased the camera and I can t even get the LED light to turn green so that I can connect it. I will be returning the camera. 
21386 4 Great camera! 
21387 4 one of the best N nikon lenses 
21388 4 good resolution, no space 
21389 4 holds my gopro securely to tthe tripod i have, and the camera slides easily in and out of the pegs. great product, shipped fast 
21390 4 looks like the real thing. Quality? Time will tell. 
21391 4 Fast delivery and a great deal! 
21392 4 Great value! Works just fine, good picture quality. Overall very satisfied with the purchase, especially with customer service. Received an extra battery when I notified that one of the batteries was not functioning! Overall a great buy! 
21393 4 Great tripod for I-Phone. Works well with 6 plus 
21394 4 I love it! Thank you! 
21395 1 Quality is okay but the bigger cover gets in the way of the lens if fully extended 
21396 1 Bought for the convenience and after one day at SDCC the strap keeps unhooking and I almost dropped my camera. I honestly would not recommend this strap, try another brand. 
21397 4 The last pack of 10 didn t come in the box, but it doesn t look like it was messed with! It arrived on time and I m super happy to have more film!! 
21398 4 good 
21399 4 perfect for the job I needed it for. 
21400 4 Haven t tested it under the conditions I plan yet, but setup and test runs worked great. Simple setup and good response; using a Sony A3000 
21401 0 The only difference between this cap and the one that comes with it is a rubber gasket! What a ripoff. Should have come with the camera in the first place. 
21402 4 Had trouble port forwarding the F19821P camera on a Netgear/Frontier DSL modem/router and called support. Richard, the tech support remotely accessed my computer and quickly resolved my problem. Great camera. I thank Foscam and Richard for the support. 
21403 3 The tech was very helpful & solved my problem Thanks 
21404 3 So far so good. Lots to learn about it yet. 
21405 4 The best fake camera on the market. It looks far better than the very cheap one being sold under a dozen names on Amazon. This one looks real! 
21406 4 very happy 
21407 4 FANTASTIC set! Love this portrait lens and all the goodies that came with it. 
21408 4 great kit to have for your trip 
21409 4 This grip fit my new 70D perfectly and shipped very fast. I am interested in extending my shooting time but the added controls on the grip will come in very handy. I m definitely a very happy customer. 
21410 3 it does seems to loose charge faster than factory battery. Great value for money can t go wrong with price I paid. 
21411 4 good protection 
21412 4 This is a wonderful little camera. There have been moments when I missed an eyepiece but outside that it has been very good. It takes excellent pictures, and it feels very well balanced in my hand. 
21413 4 My son loves this kit. Everything he ever needed for his GoPro, and more! 
21414 4 ok 
21415 4 Exactly what I was looking for. Thanks 
21416 4 I misplaced my orginal charger and this one is a good replacement. It somes with an accesory adaptor, USA and Eoropean power adaptor. Great bargain with two batteries. 
21417 4 as expected 
21418 4 good , fast shipping , that s great :) 
21419 4 They reflect light really well and the addition of 5 colors is really nice. 
21420 4 Great deal for a great camera! 
21421 4 Clear protection and great fit... Definitely recommended. 
21422 4 Quick shipping. Works great 
21423 4 I think this is pretty nice and although I only have a regular video camera, it is important because I might drop it like I always do to my phone 
21424 4 I don t have one of these monopods but all of the reviews below that I have read are not even for this item but some tripod!!!!!! This looks great to me especially for the price. 
21425 4 Best thing to hold both my Garmin AND my NyteRyder 600 headlight! 
21426 4 It work as advertise, all my old Minolta lenses work great in my Samsung NX500 and NX1100. 
21427 4 I really like this. Works well. 
21428 3 Good Product at the right price. They are a little on the lower quality end but they are not expensive either. 
21429 4 Simply magical difference in sharpness and color of photos now 
21430 2 bag was nice and very well padded. I didn t like the color as it was not as tan as the picture showed, probably due to flash. The bad is actually a weird brown color 
21431 2 Fogged up 15-20 minutes when camera was only exposed not submerged. Didnt fit my sony cybershot snug, had to really squeeze camera case to take pictures 
21432 4 Great lens. 
21433 3 This is a great lens hood. At first it was a little difficult to figure out how to put it onto my camera, but after I got it I ve been taking great photos. 
21434 4 Good fit,. Good replacement. Even survived the most horrific, mangled trip through the post office imaginable. 
21435 4 These were fantastic. Needed them for an impromptu fashion shoot and they worked perfectly. The giant CFL bulbs mimic daylight very well and that s what I used them for, to enhance the natural daylight on an indoors shoot. Easy, light, and flexible. 
21436 0 Couldnt get it to work. 
21437 3 Cables working great , been in use for a while. 
21438 4 Amazingly simple, Will probably get another set. I did swap the disk for a larger one. Mine came with a WD green drive. 
21439 0 Do not use this adpter with zeiss. It fried my zeiss Otus lens. It had to be sent back and the lens chip had to be replaced. the aperature could no longer be changed. 
21440 4 needed a small cable to plug into the back of my car radio , this fit the bill perfectly 
21441 4 Great bag 
21442 4 Nice protection 
21443 0 Bad, several of the item came broken, including lens, tripod, etc. 
21444 4 This is my third shell replacement. Works like a charm every time. The fact that it comes with screws is incredibly helpful, just in case. 
21445 4 Just got it for my Nikon Coolpix L840 - perfect size. I was going to get another bag for 3x the cost basically just because it was purple - glad I got this. 
21446 4 I suddenly lose lenses cap while travelling This bundle really helped me in protecting my camera lenses. I always keep a spare cap It funny that i haven t last the cap since i purchased the bundle! 
21447 4 Holds out for the entire worship service. We ll see if it will hold out for a nearly two hour cantata. 
21448 4 Very good glass. 
21449 4 Very helpful 
21450 2 Slightly off. 
21451 4 This allows me to have enough juice to record to the limit of the storage capacity. GREAT! 
21452 4 Great Value at a great price. I love it! 
21453 4 Nice case for what I wanted, which was a compact case to carry on occasion my D7000 with an 18 - 200 attached. This fits snugly without any extra room. 
21454 3 Exactly what I needed 
21455 0 Not good at all. Don t bother, save your time, energy, and money. 
21456 4 i like it 
21457 4 LOVE IT! using it for reviewing training tracks with my dog, works great, easily adjustable to other people also. 
21458 2 It s ok, I didn t realize that it didn t have a view finder for the eye. I am going to give the camera away to my daughter and try another one. 
21459 4 Goes with BG-E16 
21460 3 Works very well for my Application TY 
21461 0 The control just have approx. 10 ft of range, so I have to open the door to connect and disconnect the sensor. That s really does not work. 
21462 4 Great Lens, great sharpness and nice to low light and mid-telephoto lens. 
21463 4 Great 
21464 4 Does the job at a great price. 
21465 0 Waterproof camera, nope. First time used, Lid popped open, camera ruined. Lid is impossible to close. Call Coleman, they will not back product. Called elite brands who actually make the camera for a month straight, they will not call back. This camera is a waste of money. Do not buy. 
21466 4 it is wonderful. I have two. 
21467 4 Fits just as it s supposed to. Thanks. 
21468 4 Way too fun and very dangerous too 
21469 0 It wasn t with complet cable or (USB) I bought additional VGA USB from best buy. It doesn t have full instruction. Poor quality 
21470 4 Fits nicely on the headstrap. Headstrap with camera mounted doesn t even get close to being able to sink. Don t even notice the float pro attached when wearing the headstrap. 
21471 4 Good 
21472 3 Works great for the price. First one didn t fit and I received a new one that did fit the next day. 
21473 4 I use this to house a Sony CX-900 and it s just right for that size camera with the accessories I use with it. The lock is a bit of a joke but that doesn t matter to me. Excellent protection at a reasonable price. 
21474 4 Must have for securely holding backdrops. These clamps are durable and reach fully around frame bars. Highly recommend.

21479 4 Lots of fun 
21480 4 Nice 
21481 4 Haven t spent a great deal of time using it yet. Lots of options and settings so I m reading through the manual. It does a good job in low light. The most impressive thing so far is how fast it auto-focuses. 
21482 4 Still getting used to the camera and settings, so far it has been a great camera for the money! 
21483 3 Not a bad set of batteries and had them for about a year and they have been very successful

21519 4 A++++++++++ 
21520 4 This is the second Altura UV lens filter that I have bought. I m happy with both. Great product for the cost! 
21521 3 My daughter loved all the accessories and would have been even better if it included the photo paper. 
21522 4 Awesome & reasonable product. Photoshopping after was a breeze and very clean. My pictures came out great !! 
21523 4 It is exactly what I ordered and what I expected 
21524 3 rec d as promised and as advertised 
21525 4 Love it 
21526 4 Works great!! 
21527 4 Love the zoom...wish image was better stabilized at full zoom but still impressive... 
21528 2 Was not the color shown. This case is black. I really wanted the grey version. Still it s a pelican. 
21529 4 I dropped my gopro by accident still ok bec of this case. 
21530 4 The best Adult toy! Been having a blast using it with our children. Strongly recommend adult supervision with young children. 
21531 4 I had to return the Camera, but leaving a review because getting credited for the Square Trade warranty was quick and painless. Thanks! 
21532 4 Love it,want to order another one! 
21533 3 It works 
21534 0 Terrible, System stopped powering up after 2 months. Out of Amazon return time, and Zmodo is giving me the RMA run around. Get a better brands 
21535 3 Good product. But field of view is small 
21536 3 Nice quality for the price! My dad recently dug out his old tripod that was more expensive than this one, and you can tell that this one is cheaper. But even so, it will do the job nicely and feels stable enough. I m happy with it! 
21537 4 itwas everthing that I hoped for. 
21538 4 Goid as described 
21539 4 The charger and battery worked perfectly for my 10 year old camer. 
21540 4 great value 
21541 4 Does everything it s supposed to. I clip this on my belt, so I don t use the strap that comes with it. Construction seems good and it fits the camera nicely. So, nothing to fault this on, which qualifies if for 5 stars. 
21542 4 Works as expected, its a red light to use while you are in darkness using ones Telescope. I saves your night vision. 
21543 4 Excellent quality, still working great 
21544 3 Serves it purpose for the price 
21545 4 Great product for the money more than met my expectations. 
21546 0 This item does not charge the battery. 
21547 4 I purchased this item to photo small collectibles. They are easy to handle one handed therefore you can easily adjust the extra light one sometimes needs. 
21548 4 I could not find this anywhere! I have a Nikon Coolpix, and I lost this cable. It works just as good as the original. Good price for it too! Got here quickly. 
21549 4 This was a wonderful by die package! My wireless remote was not wireless though... But even with that alteration, you can t go wrong with all the gadgets you get with such a high quality camera for the price! 
21550 4 Excellent, delivered on time, was as described, great customer service (if contacted) 
21551 4 Excelente! 
21552 2 Wish it would mount on the lens backwards for better storage when not in use 
21553 4 Great product at great price. I have other systems more expensive cost and the same funcion. ZOSI results very easy to instal and friendly in web. The QR code is realy a goog idea to make an easy conection with my movil device. 
21554 4 Very handy to have while traveling. Was able to have battery life to film/photograph every second of the 4 dives a day for 7 days. These batteries seemed to last (Though I don t know for sure) longer than the GoPro branded one that came with the camera. 
21555 4 GoPro auto charger is very handy. 
21556 4 Worked great with IPhone 6 plus. 
21557 2 Ok cloths but not as high quality as other cloths I got with my new glasses 
21558 4 Great sound quality and nice and slim/light. 
21559 3 I got everything I was promised The package arrived on time well worth $19 and change...Jed 
21560 1 fell apart in a week 
21561 4 works great with my Sony alpha 3000 , it s water proof .Arrived in a few days, it s exactly what I needed 
21562 4 This looks completely real. Lights up nicely too giving the impression it is legit 
21563 1 I m going to keep it because I can make it work, but it is disappointing that the strap won t tighten up enough to stay on my wrist. Service and delivery was excellent. 
21564 4 Perfect. Reliable and easy to install. 
21565 3 Decent product for the money 
21566 3 works great cheap price. 
21567 2 Good! 
21568 3 Can anyone tell me how to get ahold of fujifilm? My camera came with no lens nor batteries? 
21569 4 works great!!!! 
21570 4 Love my new filter! Great service, thank you! 
21571 4 Will buy again 
21572 4 camera is beautiful BUT one setting (the house one) only draws out plain white pictures so just put it on another setting. 
21573 4 It works well I also going to buy the stunt man harness gives extra positions for the stuff I m into 
21574 3 They work very well 
21575 4 Batteries work as expected. And were really cheap! So 5⭐️ I guess. With a product like this, it can really only be either 5⭐️ Or 1⭐️ Either it works or doesn t. And the batteries do last a fairly long time. 
21576 4 Perfect! I have been looking for something like this FOREVER. Now I don t have to wear pants with pockets when I shoot =P 
21577 4 Great price, great service, and great quality! 
21578 4 Pretty good item 
21579 4 fantastic. used for a few months now, no issues. setup was a breeze if you know a little about technology. IR is WAY better than expected. truly commercial grade 
21580 4 Great camera to have. 
21581 3 Item arrived quickly in good condition. Easy to use. The mini tripod that came with it broke after a couple of uses. Overall nice product. 
21582 4 Standard military issue NVG mount. Hardware fits just right. We ll see how it lasts, but seems pretty sturdy. 
21583 4 What a great camera this has been. Small in size but it can take some great pictures! Plenty of settings and the video quality is good as well. Didnt think I would use the feature to transfer to/from my phone but it is handy 
21584 4 Good product, good delivery 
21585 0 Auto focus does not work on Tamron 150-600. Will be returning, not as advertised. 
21586 3 It was very good 
21587 4 Excellent 
21588 1 It didn t come with the blower, which I was looking forward for 
21589 3 Bought it as a gift which has brought joy and many thanks. 
21590 2 battery did not seem to hold its charge. 
21591 4 These are original props and fit perfectly! 
21592 3 Not exactly as I wanted but I am using it for past 2 years. Product is working 
21593 4 It works well :) 
21594 4 These last quite a long time when used to power a video light. 
21595 4 Solid construction, so far all ports work. Plugs up via usb. Love that feature since it allows me to charge all via external powerbank! 
21596 2 It works but is pretty rinky dink. I wouldn t put a really expensive flash on this. 
21597 4 Great little kit , would recommend ;) 
21598 4 Are you kidding me??? This is the best camera I ve ever purchased to date!!! 
21599 4 It s a battery 
21600 4 A small, fabulous camera with the bells and whistles of a professional s camera 
21601 4 Very light and easy to use. 
21602 4 My daughter love it,and I do also we took it to a trip and it s so cool to experience instant pic without been able to edit or repeat it 100 times.LOL 
21603 4 Thanks 
21604 4 I don t like typing 
21605 3 easy to install and use i have 3 cams.One died early but we have had a really wet summer 
21606 4 This mini tripod has amazing applications for specialized photo situations. 
21607 4 bought used mint condition pics are sharp couldn t be any happier with it 
21608 4 Super helpful for photographers like me! 
21609 4 good 
21610 2 Good product battery life low 
21611 4 This is a fun and must have accessory to any GoPro camera 
21612 2 The FloarPro looks like it is good quality, but I used this about twice and one of the plastic mounts snapped rendering it useless. 
21613 4 For hiking, catching a quick shot in the mist. This product is THE Best! 
21614 4 Good products I would like to get two more of them. 
21615 4 Great replacement battery. No issues, I used it to shoot a wedding and it held charge for the whole event. 
21616 4 Pretty nice tripod arrived a day early too 
21617 1 Low quality pictures 
21618 4 thought this was a bigger case, it won t fit my camcorder but it will be ideal for my camera 
21619 4 Good quality. Have had this for a few years now. 
21620 0 They are not a Clear view distributor. none of the product has warranty. Not approved by company. 
21621 4 I ve got to say, these filters definitely are worth the price! The package came in perfect condition, ad the filters work great, although the cool only works at a certain angle lighting and what not, but overall it is worth five stars!! 
21622 4 Great addition for the GoPro 
21623 4 Love it! Works great with my Nikon D3300 I just got. No more running to get in the picture in the allotted seconds! Makes for much more relaxed group photos! 
21624 3 Foscam cameras work pretty well for me, except I have been worried about hackers logging into my cameras. I just set up my 4th camera however and the customer representative named Walter was knowledgeable and professional. 
21625 4 Excellent control, does exactly as described. No problems yet! 
21626 4 Worked as replacement well 
21627 4 I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it! She loves cameras and she tells me that the quality of these work perfectly fine! 
21628 4 It works. Light alum material. Works as advertised. Will buy again. 
21629 4 Fits perfect for 27 mm lense. Comes with polarzer and UV filters. Only dow fall is lack of compact holding case. 
21630 4 Amazing!!! Lighting is perfect and very easy to set up! 
21631 4 Organization, good. 
21632 4 This is a great little camera for the semi pto or starter. It is versitile, has almost all the same components as higher end cameras, and takes great shots. Money well spent! 
21633 4 works fine. 
21634 4 Fits my iPad Mini and is well made. 
21635 4 Good and fit just right 
21636 4 Had to modify a bit to fit on my tripod but it works perfectly 
21637 4 Bought these to replace a stock lens cap holder that no longer sticks. These fit the lens. No issues so far, and with the 10 pack, it s not a big deal if they don t end up being durable. 
21638 4 A very satisfactory product. worth the money spent on it. The picture clarity is amazing. Captures the minute details with perfection. 
21639 4 Great quality for this price. Fits perfectly for Canon Rebel T1i. 
21640 4 Fit my NX1000 stock lense perfectly. 
21641 0 Didn t work

21645 4 I love it! 
21646 4 I am still learning to use this camera but I have already took some very good quality pictures and the zoom is impressive. I am very happy with this purchase 
21647 4 Came quick and did the job. 
21648 4 Great value for the money. 
21649 0 Extremely Poor Image resolution. We were very glad we tested this before going on our trip. Spend the extra few bucks on the GoPro hero and you will be as thankful for the decision as we were. 
21650 4 going to use this for a guest book for my grandmothers 90th birthday. got it today and tried it out... took everything for me to not use all the film :) 
21651 4 Great and fast way to capture moments. It s so fun to take pictures with this camera! The product is exactly as described and adorable! 
21652 0 Not worth the money 
21653 0 I have Canon 6D and I couldn t get it to work even after spending 3 hours trying to adjust it.

21666 4 Everything works as described. This is one of my most important toolset to own. Love it. 
21667 4 Superfast service and superb quality from this company - this is excellent &#34;no news&#34; news, I d say. You will, too. 
21668 0 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NBNJZEK?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00 
21669 3 Perfect, just what I wanted. 
21670 4 is very good 
21671 4 work with my hero 3 blk 
21672 4 Great product. It is everything I need 
21673 4 This one works great. 
21674 4 In answer to a posted question, yes. this is a true FX lens and a superb one. It works beautifully with my d810 as well as being an excellent portrait lens with my d7100. 
21675 0 The case appeared decent but the top clip had chipped so no use. Quality control issue. Returned for refund and getting different brand soon. 
21676 3 Love this camera. Works really well. Still reading through the owners manual there is a lot to learn. I love the built in wifi though, such a great feature! 
21677 2 Does its job for website photography for our shop. Quality is on the cheaper side, but it s fully functional and so far its been reliable. I ve had it about 8 months now. No problems. I use it for product shots. 
21678 4 Its wire for a specific function. What more can I say? 
21679 4 These cameras are Awesome! Unbelievable clarity, and capability to pan and zoom. They ROCK! 
21680 4 The protector seems to be of a high standard. I may just have been lucky, but the application process went smoothly. No scratches noted so far, and no bubbles. Overall, very satisfied. 
21681 4 Great! 
21682 4 Just recieved my new Drone for my son, he absolutely loves it. Great first Drone for someone starting out flyine one.. 
21683 1 This product does not support the 5-in-1 diffuser made by the same company.I couldn t get it to stand up with the diffuser attached. the legs didnt open wide enough (they never do, do they?) and didnt offer enough support. It constantly fell over as soon as I let go. 
21684 4 I tell everyone to buy these as baby monitors because they re much better and cheaper than the average or even top-of-the-line baby monitors. 
21685 4 good product 
21686 4 Great props! Aircraft even seems more stable and quiet. 
21687 4 Received on time and packed very well. I charged both batteries and tested them in my new Sony camera and they worked perfect. I recommend this item. 
21688 0 Waste of money 
21689 4 Exactly what I wanted it works with the car charger as well, if you have more then one battery I would highly recommend buying one of these, I have no problems with this product at all 
21690 2 I tried the X-rite on my Mac Book pro and my colors are still bad. Then I tried with an external monitor, A 27&#34; View-sonic VX2703MH-LED and see no change at all. I created a new user, the profile is just perfect. 
21691 4 Very useful for road riding for beginners 
21692 4 This slider is great for the price! It s really helped me grow a lot. It s sturdy too! 
21693 2 Was smaller than what I needed, but would make a nice office desk decor 
21694 4 Thanks 
21695 4 Product was delivered as promised and it was exactly as pictured and described. Will order from Digital Goja again in the future. 
21696 0 As far as I ve seen this little thing should come with a piece (adapter / marker) to set it properly.. Well!! Good news doesn t come with it, so now I have to invent by myself how assemble it. 
21697 4 Great piece does what I need it to do. Not sure how the auto focus is because I am using a manual focus lens with it. 
21698 4 Not expensive, comes with a double side charger. Works well with my Xiaomi YI. 
21699 4 This frame is great! I haven t had it long so I haven t programmed it for all the things it can do, but I have read the manual and I look forward to taking advantage of all the great features! 
21700 4 It is perfect!!! so compact and works great. Came just in time to charge for my trip to the Oregon Coast with the family! Can even charge in the car!!!! 
21701 4 Great product - fast delivery!!!! 
21702 4 Great company. The security cameras are perfect. Built to last. The picture quality is very nice, night vision is incredible. 5 star 
21703 4 Excellent 
21704 4 Really bright. Don t look into light. Get the diffusion cover. Must get Sony type battery separately to use light. Bluer than sunlight. Works well with reflector umbrella. 
21705 2 Needs styrofoam backing to make it fit GoPro 
21706 4 Looks good, comfortable to use and my camera can fit nicely into it. 
21707 1 1 camera worked the second would never turn on. 
21708 4 Good 
21709 4 have had limited usage yet but seems great - especially for the price 
21710 0 it takes a fulls second to catch up when you look left or right. i would not recommend these glasses. 
21711 4 terrific unit..great quality for the price...range 1,000 ft !!!!! 
21712 4 Great product! 
21713 4 very good performance 
21714 4 bought this for my wife maybe a little more than she can handle but a very nice camera. 
21715 3 Love the look and no more back pain from my previous slings! My favorite camera harness yet. Great for women with larger bust lines. Only slight issues with loose clothing getting caught and pinching of skin when not wearing sleeves. 
21716 4 Great 
21717 0 do not ever use proper cardsthey don t work and you re screwed if you do use them 
21718 4 I like it. I am excited to use it when my is at college and I can see him and talk with him. 
21719 4 Replaced my 832 that died. Works great. 
21720 4 Just what I needed. 
21721 0 Not happy about how Amazon recommends this with the Meike 910 and it doesn t work with it! When it did light up, I found it didn t make a difference with my flash and now the battery pack won t power up at all. 
21722 0 The chopper came dysfunctional; two propellers gave out after the 2nd flight. I went to return it, but there return policy expires the day after you received it. BEWARE of the return policy, it s not enough given time to return it. 
21723 4 Really cool little camera. Great fun to use. Pulls you into the world of creative videography. Fun!, Fun!, Fun! 
21724 4 I realy like thar it also came with a car charger adapter. 
21725 4 great for traveling 
21726 0 I have an issue. I bought these a few months ago and everything worked perfect besides one pack! The last pack is inside the Polaroid but nothing comes out. I am pissed about this. 
21727 4 Great brace. I use it with a set of very large x56mm objective binoculars. I set the brace up to sit where my abdomen meets my sternum or atop my Alaskian Guide Creations bino pack. 
21728 4 Alvin Mathhews was very good and a gentlemanvery patient and knowlegeable 
21729 4 GREAT camera! 
21730 4 They charge fast and last forever running a 7in HD IPS field monitor. The included 12v adapter provides charging in the field where there is a cig lighter or 12vDC acc plug. 
21731 3 Works great looks great 
21732 2 the system works great.. but the Uniden App is totally lost.. Uniden Company needs to fix this ASAP 
21733 4 For it s size, this is incredibly durable. Most small &#34;travel&#34; tripods are cheap junk. This isn t. I love it. 
21734 4 nice nice 
21735 2 item was same as description. The shipping was fast. I would recommend this seller. item not that great 
21736 0 Waste of your money. Would not recommend buying this product. 
21737 3 This is quite a nice addition for my portable video shoots of presenters using a curtain backdrop. The bulbs can be replaced with brighter ones if needed. Good quality materials and the videos are greatly improved using the lighting setup. 
21738 4 The camera is cute and perfect starter camer for my tween daughter. She s learning all the modes and is inspired to take good photos. This will help her be on her way! 
21739 3 ok 
21740 4 I recieved this as a gift to replace a very old HEAVY tripod. It is a great replacement, much lighter to carry but holds my Nikon D3300 great! 
21741 0 I couldn t use the power button or the side button that switched it from vibrate to ringer once the case was on. 
21742 4 this product is a great replacement item for the one that came with the camera. 
21743 3 works great with camera 
21744 2 This is the Fuji flagship ttl flash for the x-series cameras... It s pretty limited in features, the lcd user interface is pretty terrible, has no slave mode (infrared, optical, or otherwise) it s only getting 3 stars because it does get the exposure settings right 
21745 2 Works good. 
21746 4 I ended up returning this item ONLY because it was not appropriate for the size of our system. Otherwise, it provided a nice spotlight for our cameras. 
21747 4 Work as advertised. It s nice to have backup power when making a long hike or bicycling trip. 
21748 4 good camera for the price, will recommend to friends. 
21749 0 Tris is a pes of s*** i was flaing around 200m and The drone fail down because a stall motor 
21750 4 I just need the nuts 
21751 4 I am loving this monitor right now. Super clear. For the price I am getting exactly what I needed. The refresh rate at times is delayed slightly but other than that I am satisfied with this purchase. Fast shipment as well. 
21752 0 Quick delivery from Amazon,Drone sucks NO directions,NO parts sheet,NO tec support,High priced junk,China crap BUY AMERICAN 
21753 2 Kinda cheap. You have to be directly in front of the camera which makes it not that valuable to me. Would not buy again. 
21754 4 calvin was great help 
21755 4 I have purchased two of these for my cameras. It was two of the easiest installations I have ever made. It goes on so quickly and before you know it is attached to the screen just as pretty as you please. 
21756 4 good stuff 
21757 4 Works great. It charges the battery very quickly. I d purchase again. 
21758 4 Perfect replacement battery form my older Olympus camera. 
21759 4 This is the perfect camera for my wife to get into photography with. 
21760 2 This camera works well, although it s limited as far as it s monitor capability. It s battery life is good and it take excellent high quality shots. I didn t like the menu structure and that is perhaps the biggest challenge. However its great for action 
21761 4 Worked and fit like original Canon Batteries 
21762 0 This arrived broken. I realize that it is inexpensive, but I didn t expect it to arrive already broken. It was unusable to me for the project for which I ordered it. 
21763 4 Haven t had to use it yet, but good to have! 
21764 1 The software stinks, poorly designed with no real instructions. While it does work, if doe s not my needs. 
21765 4 Fine 
21766 1 Ok for the price but NOT 32X. I tested it against my 10x Vortex monocular and it s magnification is less than the Vortex. It appears to be 8x, which is nowhere near 32x. I guess for the money it s not too bad for an 8x monocular. 
21767 4 amazing bag, tough and well organised 
21768 4 Easy to set up. Worked good. Shipping slow. 
21769 2 One battery died in a month or so. 
21770 1 The cameras are not wireless. So you have to have a plug wherever you place them which means they can not be DISCREET. 
21771 4 It s an eye cup. Nothing much to say about it. Replacement for one that fell off. 
21772 4 Excellent!!! Perfect time to arrive sooner than they promise .... Love it !!! 
21773 4 Great product, worked as described. Just what I needed. 
21774 4 This filter works great for long exposure photography. I really like the Lee system. You must learn how to use these filters properly, but when you do, you can get some outstanding photos. 
21775 4 charged the batteries up works great 
21776 4 For the price I didn t have very high expectations....that was a mistake! it exceeded all my expectations. About 2 seconds after I unpacked it I had it up and running...so simple to use 
21777 4 Enjoying this lens, I live where there are a lot of wildlife (deer, bobcats, turkeys, foxes etc) and I have gotten some great shots with this lens without spooking the animals. 
21778 4 The best 3-axis tripod I ve ever used. Very intuitive, strong, durable and functional. Not cheap, but worth the investment. Try buying 3 cheap ones and compare that to the cost of one nice one! 
21779 4 Excellent 
21780 3 Just a perfect purchasing experience: item was in stock, treated to timely delivery, and worked as expected lot of the box. No issues atoll; highly recommended. 
21781 4 Good Product. 
21782 3 great buy...a few dings but works perfectly !!!! 
21783 3 Works very well. 
21784 4 Small compact great product. 
21785 4 Love it! I also purchased the cell phone mount for my note 4 and it totally fits my needs! 
21786 4 just what I needed 
21787 1 They re poor quality and didn t seem to be put together properly, some louder than others, some batteries came dead and had to be replaced. Some people are saying there s a feature to make them ding when the door opens. Mine have 2 options, On/Off that s it. 
21788 4 Does what it is supposed to do. I don t think it needs extended review... 
21789 4 Happy with my purchase. 
21790 4 Great, still works perfectly after about 4 months 
21791 4 Bought as a replacement for another brand s replacement plastic latch. So far this one has done the trick! It might be a bit heavier but it is both strong and doesn t look loud like other colors of anodized aluminum 
21792 4 Excellent videos recorded and simple set up. 
21793 3 It has a great build made of metal only. The screw for the hotshoe unscrews easily so the whole thing swivels often. 
21794 4 This is a great little camera. Everything I expected. Happy with the purchase! 
21795 4 Charges as quickly and as well as original in first my two uses. Thicker than Canon original but not as wide; still fits in my bag easily. Haven t tried car adapter yet. 
21796 3 Works well and good price. 
21797 4 Honestly, I was super surprised by the quality of this bag. This bag is EXCELLENT for a amateur photographer (like me!) :) and $24.99?! The canon equivalent of this bag at best buy is at least $60! 
21798 4 I own two of these, great price I ll keep buying them for shure. 
21799 2 Slips off the strap too easily 
21800 4 Easy to install in wood as long as you don t hit buried screws or nails. Unobtrusive. 
21801 2 This stand doesn t hold more then 4 pounds. 
21802 4 Works great! I used on a 10hr plane ride to make a timelapse (http://andrewferguson.net/2015/08/15/seattle-to-heathrow-time-lapse/) and I had no issues. For $5, you can t go wrong with this. 
21803 0 Doesn t have a button to take picture 
21804 4 worth every penny!! plug into your camera and record the future... 
21805 4 Best accessory investment I have made as an amateur photographer! 
21806 4 Kenneth was very professional and helpful and knowledgeable in setting up my Foscam camera on my computer and my smart phone. Easy to understand and knows his Foscam products well. Thank you 
21807 4 super 
21808 4 every thing ok 
21809 4 I ve had the system installed a couple of weeks now. For the price this thing is feature loaded. Does what it is supposed to do, easy install, customer support very helpful. 
21810 4 Works as advertised. Gave me great time lapse photos. 
21811 4 Very pleased 
21812 4 Great case when you don t want to carry around a lot of gear. Durable, well made. Stable base - can set it down and it won t topple. Suspension cradles camera and accommodates many lens sizes. 
21813 4 Very nice item to give as a gift! Thrilling to see &#34;baby&#34; pics with the gift I gave :) Quality materials...very pleased with this product for gift giving! 
21814 4 Nice Lens 
21815 3 It works fine--a little cumbersome to program until you get the hang of it. Range to receiver is quite short so positioning it at the end of the drive was difficult. 
21816 4 Everything works good 
21817 4 Love it! 
21818 4 thank you 
21819 4 It is good and delivery time was great 
21820 4 Very handy octopus cable (well, quadrapus) for powering multiple low-draw devices from one source. 
21821 4 The product excellent! Arrived on time! Love it. 
21822 4 Great batteries last longer than my original cannon battery. 
21823 3 Amature Photographer....It s a lot of stuff for the price. If you purchase this stuff separately you re going to pay 3x as much the flash is $60+ alone. I m having fun learning about all the different filter and playing with the lens. no problems with any of it 
21824 0 It does not work. It does not charge the battery. 
21825 4 I m very pleased with the flash and I feel the seller did a great job..... 
21826 3 the body camera, lense and other items are very good but I received a wrong usb cable which is from Canon and that cant t fix with my camera!! I need the right brand and fix one. please replace it. 
21827 4 Thea s blades are fairly balanced and arrived on time. I have used them off and on for a few weeks and have seen them take quite a beating. 
21828 4 The video and audio is amazing on these glasses I was very amazed how good they work and for a great price. 
21829 4 These slide were great! We used them for a STEM Day Camp and the youth loved them. 
21830 4 Fast setup, easy to tote around, perfect for me. 
21831 3 roduct as described received on schedule. 
21832 4 FYI.....There s a $200 rebate from Panasonic on this camcorder AG-AC90APJ. The last three letters must be APJ to qualify. http://www.bhphotovideo.com/FrameWork/Rebates_Promos/093015_PANA10_070115.pdf 
21833 0 The bottom, where the weights are, just slide off. Almost dropped my camera. TERRIBLE, DO NOT BUY THIS! 
21834 4 great product 
21835 4 This fit my camera correctly and works very well for the price. 
21836 2 Feels cheap but works, worried about it breaking 
21837 1 No instruction. Pass up 
21838 0 Junk ! the Bluetooth function doesn t work. I guess you get what you pay for. 
21839 2 This lens is much slower to focus and much louder (on my Sony A6000) than I had anticipated. I returned it and got the 35mm Sony, and I m much happier. 
21840 4 Perfect! 
21841 2 The tripod good for non DSLR camera, the bag it is very nice & the wire shutter release good for small DSLR like Nikon D3200 
21842 4 Excellent Product! 
21843 4 These items arrived in perfect condition and will be used by teachers in outdoor classroom science! 
21844 2 Had trouble closing binos enough to fit my eyes. 
21845 4 this item was delivered very fast and it works perfect. thanks 
21846 4 camera came promptly and is very helpful. great purchase. 
21847 4 Great case. Great build. Fits camera perfectly. 
21848 4 Works great for quick, on-the-go shoots! Easy to carry and set up. Recommend for sure. 
21849 4 just what I expected 
21850 3 I bought Two of these cameras to monitor and watch my dogs when I am at work. They are fantastic not only can I see the dogs but I can talk to them through the camera. 
21851 4 Awesome camera. 
21852 3 Sturdy and working great! 
21853 4 Used at water park, in lazy river and down big slides. Easy to hold no matter how many twists and turns. Worked great! 
21854 4 Love this frame! It helps a great grandmother feel in touch with everyone. Anyone would love this frame! Looks great and is easy to work. 
21855 3 this good price 
21856 4 Exactly what I expected to purchase. A little on the thicker side which is great. 
21857 4 Excellent camera, good security 
21858 0 Loved my purchase but it was used and the battery only lasted so many times before I packed it away. 
21859 4 I truly live this and will certainly recommend it to others 
21860 4 Perfect 
21861 3 Great accessory for the Go Pro ;) 
21862 4 If you can get the adjustments just right, this stabilizer is as good as they come for the doe. 
21863 4 works as expected 
21864 3 Works on my motorcycle, and fits my off brand GoPro knockoff 
21865 4 Great buy! 
21866 4 GREAT DEAL!!!!!!!!!! 
21867 2 OK - but too light to hold a Canon 5D Mk 3 with macro &#34;65&#34; lens. 
21868 1 Product did not keep the settings after several attempts to change them. Did not want to order another in event problem still existed with a new one. Looked cool though.. Went with a different dash cam that has worked great. 
21869 3 It seems like a pretty decent quality light bag. It keeps the light out. I m a little concerned the zipper is going to break, it feels very flimsy. 
21870 2 Unfortunately, this NVR was not compatible with my existing cameras and I Han to return it. The return process went very smoothly. 
21871 4 Perfect for the Sony NEX5T! 
21872 3 Good strong quality, much better than the cheap knockoffs. 
21873 4 excellent 
21874 4 Very easy setup, decent picture day and night, pan works well, half the price of others that don t have as good software. 
21875 4 Have it on my desk in the office. Gets lots of compliments for its clarity. 
21876 4 Used the camera on a recent 7 day cruise to Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. Took many great pictures. I really like the12x zoom and the camera s small size.It tucks away in a shirt pocket, but has the features of a much larger camera. 
21877 4 The image is better than my old cameras. 
21878 4 Definitely worth its money in twofold. sharp,accurate, light, easy to use. A good choice for an amateur I d say 
21879 2 Plate dose not have a griping strip on its surface causing plate to loosen from the lens ( Tamron 150-600 ) mounting base. Must carry Allen wrench for insurance while on a shoot. 
21880 3 Thank you. 
21881 2 Didn t expect much. Got what I paid for. Have used it for a few weeks with no problems. Attaches and removes easily. Just beware that you may pick up some silhouetting when fully extended. 
21882 3 This fits nicely around the body of my Nikon D5300. The silicon is a little slick, hopefully that won t last, as it is just that little bit slippery to the touch. It looks like all camera functions work perfectly, I m very happy with it. 
21883 4 Received as described and prompt shipping. Fits my Nikon D3200 perfectly and protects the LCD screen. 
21884 3 Fits tight on a 35-70 f/3.4 zoom, just like all the pro adapters I have bough from Fotodiox. A little too tight in that it s somewhat hard to remove from that lens, but not really a problem. 
21885 0 I only had it for a short time. I could not get it to work at all so I sent it back same day. 
21886 3 Does as advertized. Very sturdy and the length is perfect--though it is adjustable. This is my default, go to GoPro accessory. I have had it soaked in water and flailed around by friends yet no damage to the fabric at all. 
21887 4 It all went fine 
21888 3 Excelent for X-E2! forget the lensmate equivalent. 
21889 4 Perfect background for photos! Great quality. 
21890 4 Does all I want it to do and more!!!!! Very pleased with this purchase, THANKS AMAZON!!!! 
21891 1 The door of Fuji film s5000.3.1mp battery not working 
21892 4 It s thick black aluminum, and it s great! 
21893 4 Great lens. I use it with a D3100 at the moment. The wide aperture is great, I recommend a protective filter though because it would be very easy to scratch. 
21894 2 Vinyl is thick enough, but the product is not affixed the the cardboard core. Would also, be nice if the core was a larger size. Fair value product. 
21895 3 Usage very good can charge canon batterys as well 
21896 4 😀 
21897 4 Excellent 
21898 4 Great case, built really well. Fits my gopro hero4 perfectly. I would definitely buy more of their products. 
21899 4 I love my GoPro, Great quality, and great price for an awesome camera to last for a very long time! I use mine primarily for motorcycle rides. 
21900 4 Love it 
21901 3 this flash is great. 
21902 3 It protects very well, but you must observe their instructions for installattion re: eliminating all dust....I have a couple of small dust particles underneath that can t be removed... 
21903 4 A+ recommended to everyone. 
21904 4 never loss it in the ocean! 
21905 4 Excellent product. Received as promised schedule. 
21906 3 Great camera! A few accessories are unnecessary and probably will never be used, but overall I m very happy with the camera! 
21907 4 Works great! 
21908 4 Works as expected 
21909 3 Battery last long, remain full capacity after almost a year of using 
21910 4 Works great. At first had some issues with tilting to the left, but I contacted the manufacturer and following their detailed instructions was able to fix the tilt and stabilize correctly. Beware you need Windows PC to do that. It does not work with Apple. 
21911 4 This is ideal to keep from loosing a lens cover. I have been very pleased with it. 
21912 3 One of the screws that holds the umbrellas is bad, the screw will not move. 
21913 4 Excellent photo capture in the water, under the water or in the dry. Love it. 
21914 4 I feel this flash shoe umbrella holder is among the best. All metal construction, it solidly and securely holds my flash equipment. This is a well made product. 
21915 3 Would easily have given 5 stars if they had one additional feature, zoom. Otherwise an excellent value for the money paid. I purchased the factory reconditioned units, (same warranty as new), and am most pleased with their operation. 
21916 3 I bought others which don t hold a charge but these do. Higher priced but worth it. 
21917 0 The softbox very heavy for the the bracket, and the bracket start to bend in some area.!!! abd I could not tilt the softbox because of the weakness of the bracket and the totally wrong design. 
21918 4 Fits perfectly - excellent condition. 
21919 4 Just what I have been looking for. I have family photos that span the early 1900 s up to today. 
21920 4 I LOVE IT. works really well. blue nobs works well. awesome rig. could improve the barn doors for foldability. 
21921 4 This is the 3rd camera like this I have bought. I keep dropping them! It takes great pics and it s very close to professional for an auto digital. 
21922 0 Eyepiece would not screw into camera platform. I had to glue it? Not. Good!!!!!! 
21923 4 These are great. I ve used this brand for several years..all batteries and chargers are working like new 
21924 4 Works great for my CCTV cameras. 
21925 4 Great Product ! fit perfectly on my Olympus E-PL6 that mount on any Nikon Ais lenses , no regret purchase it 
21926 3 Tripod works great! Remote works great! Great deal! 
21927 2 Protects very well at a cost of making the camera bulkier. Excellent quality 
21928 4 Very nice, sharp. 
21929 4 Had an issue with the original hardware and was shipped one out to replace it immediately. Thank You! 
21930 4 This item is sturdy, strong and definitely worth the price. 
21931 4 Really nice! Quick shipping also 
21932 0 Worst tripod I ve ever used. Outside of it being very wobbly, the legs never extended properly. Just cheaply made in my opinion. 
21933 4 works great 
21934 4 Really like this speed light 
21935 4 I really like this camera case! So glad that I bought it! Fits my camera perfectly as described. 
21936 4 Love this case. Everone compliments it too. Looks very classy in white! I would highly recommend it. 
21937 4 Good 
21938 4 Other than the no on/off button or switch, it s great and easy to use. I ve never used a timer before, and I am a new DSLR owner, but I was able to figure it out with a quick glance at the manual (a REAL quick glance lol). 
21939 4 Fits good. 
21940 2 Can someone remind me why I bought this. Unless you have used it do not buy it(I would recommend Polarize filter). 
21941 4 Great film deal. Gift for my granddaughter. 
21942 1 I don t recommend this product. I think a gel filled strap or a single air cushion feels better than these mini air cushions. I m going to return this product. 
21943 4 They worked for me. 
21944 4 Great Product!!! Received promo code for a review!!! 
21945 4 Good for the price. ... easy to install 
21946 4 camera perfect 
21947 4 Performs as advertised. Very Satisfied. 
21948 4 My daughter loves it. She can share her pictures instantly with her friends. 
21949 3 works good. but made out of hard plastic. gopro floats 
21950 4 Nice price 
21951 4 as good as oem and cheap 
21952 0 Not good product. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. 
21953 4 Good lens hood. It makes a difference for my Camera 
21954 4 Great product 
21955 0 Broke within first use 
21956 4 Hi,i received your product.It s perfect and very convenience,thank you./. 
21957 0 This crap doesn t work! It s a scam! 
21958 4 Good used 
21959 3 Compact and fits the Cannon Powershot well. 
21960 4 Ok 
21961 4 Fantastic camera. I used it with the Olympus underwater housing and got really good pictures while diving. I also used it as a handy point and shoot while travelling around if I didn t want to pull out my SLR. Nice sharp clear pictures. 
21962 4 Perfect! 
21963 4 if went out 
21964 0 The color is not the best 
21965 4 Amazing flash for starters and pros. Couldnt be happier with this flash. Well built and amazing features. I wud go with the panasonic enloop battieries black battieries i have confirmed they are the best for this flash. 
21966 4 Great for my cine lens 
21967 4 Had it now for quite a while. I also have a bunch of Profoto gear and although its not as good quality wise it is great for the money. 
21968 4 Good item.Fits well. 
21969 2 Wish that I had been aware of the vector effect. More than likely, will seldom use 
21970 0 Worst microscope I ve ever bought. 
21971 4 If you own a D750, this is a must own. The batteries will last for multiple photo sessions or a long day of wedding shooting. The plus side is also that it helps balance the camera with larger lenses (ie 28-70 2.8). 
21972 4 This lens is now my new favorite lens. Very sharp and a great price! 
21973 2 great product. 
21974 4 Great price for a well built filter. 
21975 1 The sticky gizmo to adhere to the lens cap didn t stick for very long. 
21976 4 Love it! 
21977 4 THEY WORK PERFECT 
21978 4 There was a minor cosmetic issue with the case. I contacted the seller and they handled it in the best possible way. Thanks! 
21979 4 Great quality camera! Gives me a piece of mind when I m not at home. Highly recommended! 
21980 4 Works perfectly with my Hero 4 Silver. A must have GoPro accessory. I scratched the lens on accident and CamKix replaced the whole kit at no cost. 
21981 4 These batteries are working well. They appear to rival the stock batteries in runtime. The charger can be powered by AC or in a car cigarette lighter, which makes it super convenient. 
21982 4 Great! 
21983 4 It s what I needed. 
21984 4 Perfect case for traveling because of its compact size and brief case like handle. Organizing slots make it ideal to store accessories and extra batteries. 
21985 2 This is a good quality case, but it s too small to hold all my GoPro accessories. Glad I didn t order the small! 
21986 4 Many options with this kit! Love it all. 
21987 1 It doesn t fit the lens even though they had my camera listed. Be wary. 
21988 4 Great for multiple size lenses and even storing other gadgets and cords. 
21989 4 Perfect Tripod Ballhead! 
21990 4 I bought the go pro brand because it was designed specifically for the go pro. Im not a fan of the aftermarket stuff that will melt inside your camera and ruin it. 
21991 4 Excellent product I highly recommend it 
21992 4 Was as good as described 
21993 2 for every 10 shots, you may got 2-3 that don t develope well. doubt it s the lighting as i ve taken it in the same location. 
21994 3 This was a gift 
21995 4 Fast shipping, works great, made well! 
21996 4 Excellent 
21997 3 make sure you just get good lighting, or it might be fuzzy 
21998 4 Works! 
21999 3 Exactly what I want 
22000 0 Lasted about a year and died in a barely used safe. Prior factory battery lasted 4 years. Find another brand, this stuff is garbage. 
22001 4 Love love love this set! Tons of fun, and felt like I got my money s worth. 
22002 4 Excellent case - and very affordable. Best deal I have located for my camera. 
22003 4 Thank you very much! 
22004 4 Great buy 
22005 2 The clamp is as good as the GoPro one. However, the gooseneck is too long and wobbles more than the GoPro one. 
22006 4 This was my first security camera system purchase after extensive research. This is a great product that works right out of the box. The remote viewing devices connected via internet works perfectly after looking at the video instructions. I m am very impress with the clarity of the night vision. 
22007 3 Very sturdy and well built. Great buy. The only downside is that it has plastic knobs to crew the flash in. So far so good though. 
22008 2 Very nice no problem god for price 
22009 0 completely discontent control does not work ... not to do ... the product without control is completely useless 
22010 0 One of the packs did not even work. 
22011 4 Purchased 4 of these, no problems, adds additional indication of security 
22012 4 Exactly what I needed. Fit perfectly and clicked down. Lives on my camera now. 
22013 4 Good products 
22014 3 Works for my panasonic luminx zs21. Snug fit and not the easiest to use controls on camera, but functional and keeps my camera dry. No black ring around lens for this camera. Fits well. 
22015 0 This doesn t fit with the standard go pro mounts and other accessories. Almost ruined my case attaching it 
22016 4 Excellent value. Exactly what I wanted. 
22017 0 Doesn t fit 
22018 4 Great product. Holds all of my lenses. Fits in my camera bag with ease! 
22019 4 This is an awesome product specifically for transporting camera equipment. It is well padded with several compartments for lenses etc. 
22020 4 Worked will with some binoculars that were purchased. Great for a strap replacement. 
22021 4 Really nice product with amazing customer service, definitely recommend 
22022 4 Very sturdy. Perfect. 
22023 1 Junk; only used three times and then it stopped working. Lost receipt so couldn t do anything about it. :(( 
22024 4 1 battery for the DJI Phanton 2-3 is NEVER enough. You will want to buy a few of these. The are wonderful quality. 
22025 4 Works great. Thanks. MauistyleAloha.com, Sk8Maui.com TexasStyleSkateboarding.com 
22026 4 Excellent packaging. Arrived on time. No issues. Product is exactly what I was hoping for. 
22027 4 Super-Duper. But very spotty so I suggest you use a diffuser like the Micnova Gel Softbox with it, and you can change the color temp with the softbox too with the included gels. Battery lasts a very long time. 
22028 4 Fast shipping. Product as described 
22029 4 Quick charging times and also very compact. 
22030 4 Best camera for the price, pictures are clear and the camera is very easy to use. I do a lot of nature shots with moving animals and have had very good results. 
22031 3 Fantastic little lens for m4/3. I ve been using it for street photography as well as recording choreography and it s performed flawlessly for me so far. 
22032 4 good products! 
22033 4 Easy to set up and takes great quality videos. 
22034 3 The product is exactly what I was anticipating. 
22035 4 Best investment I ve made so far aside from my lenses and camera. 
22036 0 Waterproof case broke after one use. 
22037 4 It works well, but these Arlo accessories are a bit over priced in my opinion. 
22038 4 Does the trick and a doesn t break the bank. 
22039 4 Bought two additional camera s and they work exceptionally well. They are easy to install, great pictures on the unit. Very pleased and if you starting our on home surveillance, this a good starter product. 
22040 0 books are not lifesize, looks more like it belongs in a childrens playroom. not suitable for theater or adults. 
22041 4 Honestly, I love this camera so much. Easy to travel with .Burst photo mode, Wi-Fi capabilities is awesome! 
22042 4 Worked perfectly for the beach and keeping water out off my camera but I was too worried to submerge it under water to really test it. 
22043 0 Did not work 
22044 4 I own the plastic waterproof bag for a while, and I just found out there is a float strap that really makes my phone stay. I got one from UP Program as a free review sample. I have tried it, and it works. 
22045 4 Love this lens on all the different zoom levels. 
22046 4 Very nice size and easy to adjust the legs for great shots. 
22047 4 A little more user friendlier than the Sony - Sonys moreso for filmmakers. 
22048 4 Works perfectly and came a lot sooner than I expected. 
22049 4 Very good just a wee bit heavy 
22050 4 Protects my camera so well along with being very fancy. 
22051 2 I had to research this camera from other websites to get it figured out. the software is cryptic... trial and error Needs a 48 volt supply with a POE injector... Live and learn Still trying to figure out how to change the ip addresses... The manual is totally USELESS. 
22052 4 The Battery is exactly what I needed. It looked a little different, but it works great. 
22053 4 The camera and accessories have been great, as I worked for a small, weekly newspaper. I didn t need anything too sophisticated. Overall,it s nothing fancy and the bag s zipper gave out within the first month, but the equipment alone is worth the price. 
22054 4 Great Quality Product. Make the purchase, You ll be so glad you did:-) Very small unit but it packs a punch. 
22055 4 nice and it came all in boxes fresh new thing smell nice! recomends 
22056 4 Awesome Mount, it works perfectly. The build quality is Very good and it will definitely hold up to some wipeouts. 
22057 4 it works as stated except the Zoom for my Apple iPhone. I download the BT shutter App too but not working. Anyway i am not going to return it, as it is functioning good and also good part is charging last for many days. 
22058 4 Excellent combination of GoPro supplies. All mounts and screws came in as advertised. My only complaint is the extension pole is very loose and wobbly. I wouldn t feel comfortable jumping off anything with it. 
22059 4 good quality 
22060 0 Did not work at all. Cheap plastic not what I expected at all. 
22061 4 Great camera, and nice size, fits in my purse and takes clear pics. 
22062 4 These are awesome, they get really hot though, so I wonder if that hurts reliability... 
22063 3 I m pretty happy with this! Still getting used to focusing! When I look through the lense it s looks clear as I adjust my focus, but then when I look at pictures noticed blurry was (human error) really like it for the money! 
22064 4 They fitted perfectly to my video camera and are charging fine! Thank you! 
22065 4 Excellent 
22066 4 Fit perfectly, Fast shipping!!! Thanks 
22067 4 Arrived promptly, easy to set up. Just what I needed. 
22068 1 Objects were hazy and lacked sharp contrast. I compared with Orion Oiii. 
22069 4 Just right, excellent product. 
22070 4 OK 
22071 4 Love this lens. Very versatile and razor sharp. 
22072 4 works as advertised. 
22073 3 Even though used, it works well and I like it. Very pleased with supplier. 
22074 4 I would definitely buy this kit again. Great starter kit for people getting into photography. Only complaint is the tripod is pretty flimsy when fully extended. 
22075 4 Excellent product price-quality 
22076 4 Exactly as ordered. Enjoying immensely. Very happy with purchase. Few friends already looking at the same products for purchase. 
22077 4 these energizer batteries are just what I needed for my camera 
22078 4 fits great. 
22079 2 Wish I could actually use the auto focus 
22080 4 Fell in love with the strap as as soon as I took it out of the box. Build quality is comparable to non. This makes it so easy for me to carry my camera for long durations. Would recommend it to all.... 
22081 4 Love this 
22082 1 Does not fit a Sony RX100 but even if it did, I don t think I trust the velcro enough to keep my camera dry. 
22083 3 Nice pack. 
22084 4 Great portable device! 
22085 4 Great bag for a Sony a6000! Holds a camera body with a lens and at least 2-3 more lenses plus batteries, cards, etc. Great for travel! 
22086 4 All was perfect, 
22087 4 Exactly what I needed!! 
22088 4 The drone was as expected, easy to fly, hoping that DJI will be able to send updates that will allow us to program routes 
22089 4 Excelente 
22090 3 Looks so cute and love it already thanks 
22091 2 The lock knob on this head gets stuck to the point where I had to use pliers to get my camera off. Not great. 
22092 3 Easy install. I hope I won t need! 
22093 4 works great 
22094 4 Its an amazing product evryone should have one 
22095 0 Camera is not what I was looking for 
22096 3 Everything ok 
22097 1 Most of this is junk, but the filters and cleaner were usful. 
22098 3 Works great. However it does not support a 64GB card like the newer camera. Somewhat annoying. 
22099 2 Too expensive! Bought this and a 4 pack of the generic 52mm cap. Same quality as generic but you pay 4x more for this one. Lose yours? Buy a 4 pack genetic for the same price as this single cap. 
22100 1 Wished it was a bit more durable. Didn t see much difference between the shield and the plastic shield the camera came with. 
22101 3 Quality, yes. Overpriced, YES!!! 
22102 2 Works, but the straps are difficult to adjust properly. I m a fairly wide chested person, so even at it s max adjustment it is slightly uncomfortable. The camera itself sits at an angle and requires something underneath to align it if you want it level with the horizon. 
22103 4 exactly what i was shopping for. 
22104 1 Camera picture was blurry at best. Would not focus or zoom. Install search software provided totally locked up my router. Sent it back for replacement. 
22105 4 Excelente 
22106 4 Great Value! 
22107 4 very good, and very reasonably priced. 
22108 4 Solid mount, does the job as described. 
22109 4 Very good product, I really do not like the alarm noise it makes when you arm and disarm, there should be a softer sound at this point. 
22110 3 Just as described 
22111 4 Just &#34;installed&#34; them on my lenses...seem to fit and perform as advertised. Lets just see how they hold up. 
22112 4 Kenneth was extremely helpful in getting my camera set up to use the cloud service. Excellent customer service from the technical support line. 
22113 4 Taking to Argentina in November. This could be the perfect camera/all purpose bag. 
22114 3 Fine as expected 
22115 2 Not great quality 
22116 0 These are knockoffs and total junk. Avoid this seller. 
22117 3 It is good but every 3 min i rather keep steady videos without stop when i want to turn off 
22118 4 Great and good material 
22119 4 I m only using it for 35mm slides right now but so far so good. My only complaint is that it would be nice to choose a higher resolution. 
22120 4 This was awesome!!! I have the Handycam, but needed more battery time. This product allows me to charge alternative batteries, while using the batter attached to the Camera at the same time. Good idea, great purchase! 
22121 4 I needed something to store my sd and micro sd cards in and so i saw this and decided to try it out. I m glad that I did because this was exactly what I needed. I would definitely recommend to anyone 
22122 1 Good idea but the threads don t hold it steady for some reason. I should have sent it back when I had the chance.... 
22123 4 Great deal for all these. Now I have backup accessories and they work great! 
22124 1 Wi-Fi connexion between the camera and my cellphone or tablet is unstable. Not a reliable product, 
22125 4 5 star 
22126 3 Very good items. 
22127 4 Very nice Lens 
22128 4 Save lots of money buying this instead of Nikon brand and works just fine 
22129 4 Easy to use, loved the flip down lense cover on the bottom. I wish the eye covers did the same. 
22130 4 Easy to set up and does its job without a problem. 
22131 4 Great price. Arrived on time. Durable. 
22132 4 Fantastic bag! Great quality and delivered quickly! This bag is very roomy with more than enough room for my camera, lenses, batteries and charger! It is just what I needed and the shipping was quick and painless. Highly recommended seller! Don t hesitate if you like this bag! 
22133 4 Don t doubt on purchase this great camera!! It will surprise you! Excellente quality video, and the seller very effective 
22134 4 These are invaluable if you are using any stand outdoors. I placed my sand in plastic baggies prior to adding it to these bags and I have had absolutely no issues. 
22135 4 This is a needed item that is not included with D750 camera. 
22136 4 The Nikon ML-L3 Wireless remote control is small and very handy, and it works well with my Nikon D7000 as long as you point it straight at the indicator light on the camera. Great for self-portrait taking. No wires to deal with. 
22137 4 Like it very much takes great quality pic & video light weight and very user friendly 
22138 4 I m just a novice photographer, but this is exactly what I was looking for, and at the right price! 
22139 4 Every thing fits in real good 
22140 2 The filter is fine for protecting the lens but I see some ghosting and more flares when taking photos with the filter on. I believe when it comes to filters, it s a wise investment to get the higher quality glass to ensure you get the best photos possible. 
22141 3 Works great. As expected. No issues 
22142 0 I should have read the reviews before I even purchase I would have never gotten it in the first place for adapters like this I ll stick with the vivitar that I have on my 52mm 
22143 4 Perfect for all locations 
22144 4 excellent product. fast shipping. good company. will buy again. lisa 
22145 4 Great camera for the money. We have purchased several for use at our church. Quick shipping and no problems with any of them. 
22146 4 Work great! 
22147 4 Good day I received the camera case is very nice and meet my expectation thanks. 
22148 0 It really suck it doesn t work 
22149 4 Worked perfectly for my Nikon d3200 
22150 4 Amazing camera and arrived so fast! 
22151 4 Worked great for me 
22152 4 items delivered on time---everything was intact---nice little package items were exactly as shown/described 
22153 4 Good Deal! 
22154 0 Never held a charge from day 1. Guess its too late to return this paper-weight now, but trust me - this TRULY is GARBAGE - avoid - do NOT buy. IF the company reads this, YES I d like a REFUND. 
22155 4 Good 
22156 4 Very pleased... 
22157 4 A good product. 
22158 4 great product i like that it has the rubber not many others do 
22159 3 Not the best quality but not the worst. I ve had no issues so far with producing great background images in my videos. 
22160 4 Takes great pics 
22161 4 Very nice product. Worked like a charm on my Fuji xt1 and my Nikon d750. 
22162 4 Very nice 
22163 4 Good quality products at a fair price. It was shipped fast and I found all the products met or exceeded my expectations. I was able to mount my Action Cam to the handle bar of my Harley in just a few minutes. It works great! 
22164 4 Pelican cases are uniformly excellently made. They are extremely durable, and the latches simply work well. Enough said. 
22165 4 You won t regret buying. Great quality, perfect fit. 
22166 3 wonderful camera case even if small 
22167 3 Great Product 
22168 0 Doesn t work.. tried a few times. Better to buy the battery from somewhere else. 
22169 4 seems perfect as expected 
22170 4 Takes great pictures! We had fun with this in and out of the water on a recent Florida vacation. It is s little tough to see the screen in bright sunlight. 
22171 2 ok, so it s cool to have a video of 360.... But the image quality is seriously lacking..... Hopefully the next version is better because this one just sits in my drawer. 
22172 4 Just what I needed to keep my batteries charged. Great Product. 
22173 3 Works great 
22174 3 Great 
22175 4 The cameras worked out great at our wedding. They come with a note asking guests to take pictures. I loved it because I didn t have to create, print, and fold anything myself. 
22176 4 The best, light way and durable 
22177 4 good item 
22178 4 fits great to Leupold VX-3 1.5-5x20mm (30mm) - but honestly, could be less expensive 
22179 4 I love these glasses they r perfect I use the to drive and on my mini Segway 
22180 4 Love it! Works great with my selfie stick and my phone. The magnet also works like a charm. 
22181 4 Great little gadget for my son s GoPro at a very affordable price. 
22182 4 I m using this to fly FPV on my quadcopter. Had to modify the plug to fit my needs but it works great! 
22183 4 Perfect fit and perfect outcome! 
22184 4 Works perfectly I have had it installed and working since purchase and am considered purchasing another. 
22185 4 Very nice. As described. Quick delivery. 
22186 4 Great product. It will definitely float your camera. 
22187 4 Love the night vision recordings.its clear 
22188 4 This camera takes excellent images in almost all conditions! Even though I am experienced with manual SLR cameras, I just leave this one in automatic mode and the results are generally excellent, even for detailer product closeups. 
22189 1 At manual (M) setting the screen is smaller. I returned the camera. 
22190 4 Just what I ordered. The same as my other canisters. 
22191 4 Gave me a great range of new lenses to use. I started with the 25mm which came with my telescope, and was wishing i had more options. Glad i bought this kit. 
22192 3 This was a quick buy for my daughter and the product is easy to use. 
22193 2 Pretty nice but on closer inspection seems to be made out of cheap materials. I ll probably end up replacing this later but for the value it seems like it would be good for a beginner. 
22194 4 Works perfect and is a must when your traveling!! 
22195 4 Love the HFR on this camera as well as all the other features. Adobe already supports the RAW format as well which was a pleasant surprise. A powerful camera in many ways no doubt. 
22196 4 After reading all of the reviews, I bought the camera and it performs as advertised. You can t go wrong. Have people telling me wow what a nice camera and people commenting on how nice the pictures are. 
22197 4 a-ok 
22198 4 Love it. Much easier to align our 8&#34; Celestron SCT and more accurate than a red-dot finder. 
22199 4 Works as expected. No more splicing wires. 
22200 0 Parts were missing in the order. all I received were the batteries, no charger. I sent it back. 
22201 2 the camera is great....comes with NO manual! The case they sent does not hold the camera.....just the accessories. 
22202 4 Well made and very secure. 
22203 4 Excellent product. Gives me the ability to get very wide angle shots in home interiors. Great quality, certified OE lens from Canon 
22204 4 Works and fast shipping! 
22205 0 The clip fell off the first day I got it. Reattached it for a couple weeks then once it failed for good I was out of the return window. 
22206 4 Great camera 
22207 4 I am writing this Review regarding the excellent service I received from Dlink Support My Tech Referenced Service # AR004214 was able to help me correct my problem very efficiently and with excellent customer service I will purchase more products from DLink. 
22208 4 Great product, as described; something happenes with the delivery company, nothing that bad. Will buy again. 
22209 4 So cool, I take it with me everywhere 
22210 4 Filled my need nicely. Fast shipping. Reasonable cost! Works good! 
22211 4 Great product and buyer shipped quickly! Excellent experience! 
22212 4 I needed this. I have an older 17-35mm 2.8L It fits well, but does not come off too easily. I m fine with that... 
22213 4 My GOPRO been able to keep more secure. The storage space is also a very good product than many think. 
22214 3 Met expectations 
22215 4 work very well for the money 
22216 4 Great deal, seems like a great product so far. Haven t had a chance to extensively user it yet, but so far it s great! 
22217 4 Great product. Fits perfect in my hiking pack and very light weight. 
22218 4 We use these to capiture images of products coming down an assembly line using remote shutter switches. Does an awesome job. 
22219 3 sharp image. 
22220 1 All but ruined my camera lens filter - use with caution! I gave 2 stars because it does work well on my computer screen and iPhone. I haven t tried on the television - admittedly I am a bit hesitant to try on the 65&#34; screen. 
22221 4 This camera is really easy to use. It also take good quality pictures. Perfect for blogging or if you re just a novice photographer. 
22222 4 Perfect companion for my 3TB external drive. 
22223 4 One of the best lens filter I have ever used. Hoya is the best. Same with my Canon 24-70 lens too! :) 
22224 4 must have for go pros 
22225 4 Works exactly as expected. Simply set your camera to remote shutter setting and that s it. The only thing is that the sensor on my camera (canon T3i) is right in front of the camera. So I can only trigger the shutter when directly in front. 
22226 4 Nice product, great price and very fast shipping..!! A+ 
22227 0 Go back in the warehouse make another one Cause them thing no good I bought one about a two week ago When they sent it to me it don t even work. (A-szcxtop(tm) New Mini SPY Hd... A-szcxtop(TM) 
22228 4 Guardian advanced camera system is really good 
22229 4 amazing 
22230 4 Amazing piece of glass. Straight out of the box to a shoot. Impressive delivery time too. 
22231 1 No horizontal panning. View is a cone area below the device. Limited view. 
22232 4 Good product. Very reasonable price. I always look at this line when purchasing this type of equipment. Frank DiFalco 
22233 4 Came exactly as described and looks exactly as pictured. Works great. 
22234 4 Battery works great. I was told by other Nikon owners that some replacement batteries would not be recognized by the camera. This is not one of them. 
22235 4 It was a great deal. 
22236 3 Great 
22237 4 Strong and inexpensive 
22238 4 im happy to find that i could get batteries at such a great price. 
22239 2 Was dissapointed the illustration and text all lead you to belive it is an OEM Sony battery. So I ordered it only to find it is an aftermarket battery. Hope it performs adequately, Need to more transparent that this is not a Sony brand battery, but a non-Sony replacement. 
22240 3 It good. It was a little too big for my needs so I sewed the ends to make it a smaller diameter. If you need to do that, it s easy to do with these. Heck, you could probably make your own from some old drink koozies. 
22241 0 Broke 2nd week I used it. It was worthless. 
22242 4 Love the little pics my daughter takes with this camera. Great buy! 
22243 2 was good 
22244 0 It was stiff and would not telescope the way it was suppose to, so I ended up putting it back in the bag and return it. So unhappy, junk do not buy it ever. So mad, hate the product. $119 down the drain. 
22245 3 For the price very well worth it for my nikon d3000. It didn t hold a long charge for my event like my original battery; but I brought both batteries with me and it lasted all day. Very satisfied! 
22246 4 Items were as expected and were in excellent condition. Very happy! 
22247 4 Great product, durable plastic. The screw hole configuration worked with my Lorex LRD2152 Dome Cameras. I think all Lorex dome cameras all have the same whole pattern so they will most likely work with this. 
22248 0 The product was apparently defective upon arrival. It would never boot from day one although it was getting power. The item was returned for a refund. 
22249 4 I love it 
22250 4 great great great.. from the 1st shot I took I knew I loved this lens 
22251 4 First Post! A buddy of mine bought this Nikon Coolpix P600 and he swears by it so i purchased one. Shoots great. 
22252 4 Great item at a great price 
22253 4 Works effectively - as advertized. Battery life is significantly shortened by forcing it to wake up ever 4 to 5 minutes. But this is the only way to poll for current data on a regular basis. Consider a full-power USB connection for frequent polling. Otherwise a good product. 
22254 4 Excellent. Seems to work perfectly and is exactly as described. I am happy to be able to use my camera again after jamming the original lens. Thanks! 
22255 4 I had to call for technical support. Kenneth was able to solve my problem almost immediately. I rate both the service and product FOSCAM model FI8918W as five star. [[ASIN:B0046710G6 Foscam FI8918W Wireless/Wired Pan & Tilt IP/Network Camera with 8 Meter Night Vision and 3.6mm Lens (67° Viewing Angle)]] 
22256 4 Nice cameras 
22257 4 Great product- Thanks 
22258 4 Love these binoculars...very bright and easy to locate objects while being of a nice size and weight. 
22259 4 Love it 
22260 4 Very good 
22261 4 the ultimate beginner addon to the camera 
22262 4 Arrived on time. A sturdy product. 
22263 3 Works pretty well for the price. The side button has started to become less sensitive over a few months use. 
22264 3 Good 
22265 4 Awesome camera. Love the quality of the zoom. It s my 5th Panasonic and I m very impressed with this product. 
22266 4 Takes a little bit to install properly, but looks very nice and functions fine. 
22267 4 great item! 
22268 4 We order these every three months. Great quality and a must have for all of our electronics and glasses. 
22269 4 Got these for my father in law before a big motorcycle trip out west. They were simple enough for him to use as he is not very good with electronics. The videos and sound were clear. Great purchase! 
22270 3 works, but a little tricky to figure out 
22271 0 Expired film do not purchase 
22272 0 Unusable because it would just float off our wrists. 
22273 4 Great product. Love the new experience. 
22274 4 Solved a problem for me GREAT 
22275 0 Did not fit properly. Not worth dealing with for the price. 
22276 4 Holds 4 filters and protects them well 
22277 3 its a great lens sharp good color but for my hand it was to hard toget on and off. would like to have kept it .if I had an extra body I would have made it a real point and shoot. 
22278 3 Good as expected 
22279 4 Great camera 
22280 3 good! 
22281 1 Do not expect any tech support from this company (FunLux) so purchase at your own risk. 
22282 4 It looks good, but I have not used it yet. 
22283 4 Rating: 5 of 5 Product is as described. Works good. Very pleased. 
22284 4 My niece was so excited to receive this 
22285 4 love it 
22286 4 Fit like original. Very Satisfiled. 
22287 4 The batteries work perfectly with my Nikon camera and the battery charger has been a life saver on trips to charge my batteries on the go. 
22288 4 Works great! 
22289 3 Great product 
22290 4 Product was exactly as described. Product delivered on time. 
22291 4 Works as expected and reasonably priced 
22292 4 It focuses very quickly on my sister s 60D and allows you to get quite close to the subject if necessary. 
22293 3 It is exactly what I needed at a great price! 
22294 3 I really like the storage pouches, I wish they came in different configuration options for the 1690 case. 
22295 4 Fit perfectly and now I don t have to keep losing my lens covers! 
22296 4 Cut out is perfect. After I put it on and peeled off the &#34;second&#34; layer it was crystal clear and you can t even tell there s a protector on. 
22297 4 Awesome camera 
22298 2 Although support and firmware upgrades had to be cautiously followed, customer service with Terry Morgan was great help. Now I can use the camera, view via smart device, and login outside of the home anywhere. 
22299 0 Cameras started messing up after 6 months. 
22300 4 Just exactly like the OEM battery. I love how this has three slots to charge. Nothing else to say about this great product! 
22301 0 The pics and videos are in bad quality, it end up in the trash. save your money and do not pay it 
22302 4 Excellent product 
22303 4 Love this filter. It really makes difference in skies and landscape colors. Worth every penny spent!! 
22304 4 I have had only one opportunity to try out this lens so far. It performed much better than I had hoped it would. It is pretty compact and not very heavy. I look forward to having this lens with me in the future. 
22305 1 Don t last long short life! 
22306 4 So many attachments I will never use them all great deal 
22307 3 This fits my D5100 with Sigma 18-250mm with lens hood which is exactly what I wanted. The only down side is that you can t fit much else in the case, but that s the trade-off for a case this size. 
22308 4 I can t wait to use them. They will be useful when I can t my cheetah stands. 
22309 4 Best investment i have made for my business 
22310 4 They attach. They float the cameras. Not much else to ask of them. 
22311 3 Excellent 
22312 3 Very good quality... No instructions manual 
22313 4 very easy to set up !!!! quality of the camera is a 10 !!!!! 
22314 4 Great product! I ve used this floaty handle a bunch while swimming and kayaking. I really feel better about not losing my go pro. 
22315 4 Works great makes flying more enjoyable. 
22316 3 Yes it works great and it was easy to install 
22317 4 Excellent lens 
22318 4 Decent quality camera. Love the feature of ability to move the camera from my iPhone. Great night shot. Sometimes the auto mode does not work and the day and night mode have to be changed manually. Good value for indoor security monitoring. 
22319 3 The case is large enough for the camera and some accessories 
22320 4 Yes, it s overpriced but it s small, rugged and very adjustable. I don t mind paying a little more for obvious quality. 
22321 4 Very good camera 
22322 4 fits great! makes my d3000 much more comfortable to hold. 
22323 4 Picture is sharp with good definition. It gives a good screen resolution.Excellent camera for the price. 
22324 0 I ordered the 50mm and recieved the 52mm, thought it was my mistake until I checked the order. Found out it has happened to others as well. This is not just frustrating it s unprofessional. 
22325 4 Perfect for occasional use! 
22326 4 Great battery pack. I use them on my hero 3. I haven t done any testing as to the length of charge time, but they do just as well as my regular gopro battery. 
22327 4 This is a great product with many useful features! I love it! 
22328 4 The quality of this tripod is on point. So hard to believe I paid so little for it. 
22329 0 was really expecting a stand/legs and a light bulb holder as pictured in the product photograph. I did not receive this. sick. 
22330 4 Nice camera 
22331 4 excellent 
22332 4 Works great for what we need it for. 
22333 4 Purchased these stands a few times. I have been very happy with them. Sturdy and high quality. 
22334 3 I m still working on learning how to use the camera, but love the photos so far! 
22335 2 Doesn t work for viewing on a Mac. Also had issues getting this to view under the newest version of Chrome on Windows. Tech support was fantastic but decided to return and purchase one that works with a Mac. 
22336 0 There is no mirror surface on this mirror - I removed the protective coating and it hardly reflected my face -- a waste 
22337 4 Yup great 
22338 4 Awesome!!!! 
22339 2 This case was very cute, but it was only &#34;okay&#34; when it came to protection. The plastic casing cracked and allowed my phone to constantly fall out, there for it only got used for a couple of weeks. 
22340 4 Great item price and fast shipping 
22341 4 Love them 
22342 4 Great accessories kit for the Go-Pro. My husband absolutely loves it all. 
22343 4 Excellent product. Bought as a replacement and re-charges battery 3-4 times quicker. 
22344 4 A must have for time lapse shooting and astrophotography... 
22345 4 Love it. Superb pictures. 
22346 0 When putting mk 4 in, a bit of the back snapped off, extremely unhappy. Applied almost no force when putting in and completely snapped. Also the lack of battery access is infuriating. 
22347 2 Not the best battery life. For someone who does a lot of filming, I need something a little stronger. 
22348 4 So so it s k would buy again 
22349 4 great 
22350 4 As described 
22351 4 Excellent tech support 
22352 3 So far, so good. 
22353 3 worked fine. 
22354 4 Works well for small cameras 
22355 4 Great Camera!!!! 
22356 3 Love the system Works great i instslled it myself I do wish i had an instruction manual I still dont undestand the dvr completely 
22357 4 Highly Recommended! 
22358 0 At first it seemed to work well, but it would lose connection randomly causing the camera to power down and causing me to lose my shot many times. Maybe mine was just a lemon, but I returned it and I m getting the Sony version instead. 
22359 4 On time, and super cute! I m in love! 
22360 4 Really enjoying this bag. Fits so much of my equipment 
22361 3 It s a bit difficult to figure out how to use at the beginning but once you figure it out it works perfectly! My Yongnou YN-560 IV and this pair up perfectly! 
22362 4 I use this all the time. Works very well. 
22363 3 Works very well. I have only used it for home movies so far. It works better than the mic on my Canon T4i. 
22364 4 These worked sooo much better than the straps that came w the waterproof cameras! ! 
22365 3 Only thing mildly confusing is that the LEDs and battery slots aren t oriented in any way you can remember which is which. 
22366 1 does print pics but some come out with streaks 
22367 4 Does the job. Love it so far. 
22368 0 Only one of the 4 cables worked 
22369 4 i bought camera at flea market with no charger. not knowing it even worked. gave 6 bucks 4 camera. bought kastar battery and charger kit and the camera works like a new one. right on kastar!!!!! 
22370 4 Great item 
22371 4 Excellent product! I was imagining something more simple and not so good, turns out that is an amazing camera with all benefits is a semi professional one! Love it! 
22372 4 Very cool! 
22373 1 Camera works great, but iPhone software is garbage. Alerts never work properly and their monthly/yearly service plans are wayyyy too expensive, considering what they re providing. This device has become almost useless to me. 
22374 0 In my opinion, it is just more crap to waste your money on, not to mention all the wasted time and work it takes to install it. 
22375 4 Love this product! So affordable but great quality. Great service. 
22376 4 Love it! 
22377 3 Its really pretty and a great strap, I just wasn t enthused by the rubbery grip on the back side of it. 
22378 4 This flash is astounding! It zooms the flash when you zoom your lens and has a built in diffuser as well. I highly recommend this product to photographers any photographer that s on a budget or just getting started. 
22379 3 Convenience and compact 
22380 4 Works great made money with it ready!!! 
22381 2 Flimsy 
22382 4 hot mikes and paranoid. Plus, my work has Skype/Lync and some people have been known to turn on their computer camera and sometimes they are not were they should be or wearing the appropriate attire. LOL! Ooopppsss - 
22383 0 The battery is not new, exactly like the rest of the reviews say. Don t buy this product. It does not hold a charge for more than half an hour. 
22384 4 Fit fine. Did the job! 
22385 4 Very good Camera. 
22386 4 Great kit and seller 
22387 4 Great product. 
22388 0 Actually a very high quality camera, however, the hardware used to attach the camera to equipment is not sturdy at all. I had the camera mounted on my wind surfboard and it came off and I lost it in the ocean. 
22389 2 I have just begun using it. The back screen scratches very easily and I have not found the wire to download pictures into the computer from the camera. It does not seem to come with the camera. 
22390 2 Good, however a close lens is much better. 
22391 4 These are great, but I ll never need them since I never crash! Also all my code compiles first try. 
22392 2 The mouse never worked ( I had to use an old mouse of mine) The remote works SOMETIMES. Also some remote buttons do NOT work at all So I guess I give it a 7 out of 10 
22393 4 Great 
22394 2 Great value. 
22395 4 Very well designed and built. Definitely improves handling of the camera. 
22396 4 They last longer than my original Canon lithium battery. 
22397 4 Excelente 
22398 4 This works perfectly. 
22399 4 Excelent product, economizer of energy, sensor of motion! 
22400 1 Too small..go with a large size one..can t put all your accessories in it 
22401 1 Wrong battery. Connecting pins were male instead of female. Completely useless to me. Description was incomplete. I gambled and lost. 
22402 4 excellent product, very good quality, as expected. very responsible seller 
22403 4 Great Product great price 
22404 4 Love this handycam. I got the bundle which is definitely benefical with all it contains. Tripod looks flipsy. Having had need to use it. 
22405 3 works great thanks 
22406 4 Wonderful, easy solution at an affordable price! I thought my camera was broken! Now it charges up and works perfectly again! 
22407 4 jiust love it 
22408 4 Got everything 
22409 4 Bought this for my orange loving son s first camera. He s dropped it twice (that I know of) and the camera is still perfect. Nice little case! 
22410 4 The color is nice and uniform. The paper is a decent weight and is reasonably durable. The packaging was very good. The photo qualities of the paper are very good and perform well with flash. 
22411 4 Great for traveling. Fits in a pocket and has good quality images. 
22412 4 Great deal 
22413 4 Works very well, and is so simple to use. You can use it with cable or with remote. 
22414 4 It holds up the roll of paper I bought it to hold up. I ll be moving it to a new location temporarily next week. 
22415 4 This camera & bundle is awesome for the price. This camera does not allow a wireless remote, so the bundle didn t include the remote, even though it was listed in the description. 
22416 4 Great camera 
22417 4 Reasonably priced, items as described, arrived when promised. Seller recommended. 
22418 4 Product arrived on schedule. Worked perfectly 
22419 4 Excellent 
22420 3 Added fun for my daughter and her friends!!! 
22421 2 Does the job in a pinch and is highly portable. I have used it with point and shoot cameras as well as a DSLR. Just make sure you distribute the weight properly when using a heavier camera. Basic physics! 
22422 3 Just got a set and tested them out. Seems to work fine. 
22423 4 This was perfect for a grad party photo booth! 
22424 3 Good product. Does what it should. 
22425 0 broke within 2 months junk 
22426 1 Well great at the beginning. I think i will be buying new. The lens is not working as well. I have to get it sent in for repair. The images are blury past the 100mm range bummer 
22427 4 Battery was not lasting on our camera and felt time to replace the battery. Well what better was than to get 2 batteries and charger. Can t beat the price. Everythign works great! 
22428 4 As expected! 
22429 4 If you are tried of not being able to see the image your trying to photograph, then this is the one for you. Heads-up, the image in the viewfinder will appear a little out of focus but, doesn t effect the shot. 
22430 3 Smooth transaction. A+++. Thanks you!!! 
22431 4 i love it!! great fit..i will give 5 stars 
22432 4 Fine 
22433 2 Hard to focus and hold steady. 
22434 4 This is an awesome tripod. Itbis really easy to set up and use. I am going to get a lot of use from it. 
22435 3 gooddd 
22436 1 This is a cheap tripod. The head adapter screw broke almost immediately. The panning and tilting of the head is jaggy. Unless you are setting this tripod to a single position for photography, it is pretty useless. 
22437 3 A little tricky to fold/coil up, but decent. 
22438 4 Nice carry bag. Use it all the time. Sometimes switch it with the Sony camera holster but for most travels love this bag. 
22439 4 good product, arrived on time as promised. 
22440 4 For what this is and what it cost this is the best lens you can buy for the money. It added more fun to photography. 
22441 4 Better than expected. Perfect gift for the girlfriend. 
22442 4 The pictures are clear and accurate per the subject being filmed! Only wish the pictures were larger, but I ll still order more. Really like having an &#34;instant&#34; photo in seconds! 
22443 4 Works great in my Panasonic FZ150. Have used the same one in the FZ150 for a year now and have no issues. It sees the charge level, etc. 
22444 3 A little flimsy and no markings on the filters, but creates fantastic photos! 
22445 4 Grate 
22446 4 Works as you would expect it to for a reasonable price 
22447 4 This is the simplest thing. It straps on very easily. It s easy to put on and take off. It s one of those million dollar ideas, and it comes at a great prices. 
22448 3 Some of the accessories I didn t need. And the gorilla tripod cracked almost instantly. Other than that, I felt it was a great deal. 
22449 4 Works just as advertised. Got it quickly and it works great! 
22450 3 The batteries don t last quite as long as the factory original, but the price sure is right. 
22451 4 bien 
22452 4 Live this lens!!! It s perfect for the everyday lens to sporting events. The package was secure and the shopping was fast. I definitely digest this lens. 
22453 4 As I needed for my project 
22454 4 Great 
22455 4 This is my 2nd Syma X5C. This is one tough drone! It has crashed several times and keeps going strong. 
22456 4 love it 
22457 4 Awesome quad, have had several weeks and no crashes or flyaways. Really nice product for the cost. Someone forgot to put manual in box before shipping but found everything on line. 
22458 4 Great on time 
22459 2 the camera mount is a bit stiff and hard to aim. 
22460 3 Love it ! Bought it from here at a perfect price I was a little doubtful but it s definitely worth it. Love it perfect for my hands and love the flip screen 
22461 3 Exactly what I needed to use the ! Most Excellent ! camera as a video tool. Probably got one with the original purchase, but did not know what it was for. 
22462 4 These are awesome, I love the different designs!! 
22463 4 I have always wanted a gopro and not that I have one I love it! A great buy! 
22464 4 I got into collecting old cameras to shoot film in and part of the fun for me is doing some restoration. I have used this lens sucker for picking up tiny lenses out of assemblies and works as it is supposed to. Very handy tool to have. 
22465 4 Located a Sony digital camera in a flea market. Did not wish to keep camera plugged in all the time to charge the battery. Works great! 
22466 0 My camera constantly stay off line. I file a complaint to the company and they did sent a replacement cord for free, but I still having problems. I paid too much for this camera for it not to work properly. I brought this camera to watch my property. 
22467 4 Easy to install compared to other IP cameras I have owned, comes much better software. Very wide angle lens, picture is sharp with excellent color. Excellent night vision. Would definitely buy again or recommend to a friend. 
22468 4 Excellent product I highly recommend it 
22469 4 Love the quick release function. High quality 
22470 4 Important when you need more juice 
22471 4 Good price and an absolute must have on your camera. 
22472 4 The film arrived on time. Great price! I am really enjoying my Instax Printer! My family & friends get a kick out of these tiny pictures, also. 
22473 3 It s a very neat design. A little better instruction would have been nice. But I like the double use of the tripod and converting it to monopod so easily ! 
22474 0 Item is NOT white as listed in description, the cable is NOT RG59 as listed in the description. It is Siamese and 25 foot as described. 
22475 4 Setup and use is SUPER simple! Love it! You will too! Anybody can enjoy this camera and you can set it to go on when you leave the house 
22476 4 Great product and shipped fast. 
22477 4 Works good 
22478 4 I always loved this camera. I got another one to replace one that had broken. Despite its small pixel size, it takes great pictures. 
22479 4 Love it! Perfect tripod for me and my point and shoot camera. 
22480 0 Not good. The camera appeared to be repacked and it did not perform correctly. The POE feature did not work and had to returned it. 
22481 4 Really great camera for the price. Fast shipping. 
22482 4 Excellent unit optically and mechanically, not what you would expect at the price point. Highly recommended! 
22483 2 Good lens. 
22484 4 Exactly what I paid for. Love it 
22485 4 Excellent I love it 
22486 4 works great 
22487 2 ok 
22488 4 Works great. Allows for better sound. Not for use in foul weather or where waterproof case is required. 
22489 4 Excelent. Like the original battery for my Alpha 77 II !!!! 
22490 4 took great shots ove them 
22491 4 I love my selfie stick, I use it all the time,wherever.Same exact quality as the name brand at half the price.Highly and affordable.Very satisfied! 
22492 4 Great quality and build! I have used it a lot and it feels OEM! Fit and finish are top notch. For the money its a great buy! 
22493 4 Great Product 
22494 1 This tripod is very small and lightweight, however, also very flimsy. I tried to fix it in position but it barely holds. The weight of my compact camera makes it shift and slowly collapse, certainly not what I expected. this is not a quality product. 
22495 4 Fit camera perfect and just like new. Super 
22496 4 A great price on a great case. Fits a 1911 well. Very strong plastic, just like the whole Pelican line. 
22497 0 Was great when it worked.... only ever sat in my bag and the light inside blew out after only using it 7 times (if that). Owning it for alittle over a month, Dealer said &#34;nothing he can do...&#34; Buy a 400x scope from someone else... 
22498 4 :) 
22499 4 Bon produit et livraison rapide 
22500 0 I could never peal off the film just broke 
22501 4 Great props, they are an original DJI product. Exactly the same as the ones that come originally with the phantom 3. Each pair arrived in a black fabric bag same as the one that comes with the phantom. 
22502 4 Perfect! 
22503 4 Work perfectly Thanks! 
22504 4 Good addition to the 800TVL camera installation. 
22505 4 Not only does it protect my gopro and accessories, but it keeps them organised and ready to go. Its great not only for traveling, but also is a great storage solution in general. 
22506 3 Great results. Well designed. But the instructions are poor. For example, the black coil that is seen in the view of the receiver. I assume it is the antenna, but no information is included. Can I lift it vertically and extend it? Duh. 
22507 4 Perfect quality product! 
22508 4 Great Deal. 
22509 2 It s okay but not the best.... 
22510 4 Excellent product 
22511 4 Nice upgrade to my system 
22512 4 I m really liking these AmazonBasics items. Very cheap and quality-made. I will continue to buy from Amazon. 
22513 4 One of the greatest digital camera Sony has to offer. It has good specs and the image quality is good too. 
22514 4 Great case. Perfect fit. Like the pocket that I can use for a spare battery. 
22515 4 This is the cord I couldn t find so I got another. It s working great. Love it. 
22516 4 Great product, great service. Works perfectly. 
22517 3 The UV lens sometimes shows circle crystals in the picture when its too sunny 
22518 4 a 
22519 0 Worked for a couple of months. Then stopped wortking. Company would not honor worrenty 
22520 3 This camera is very easy to operate and works extremely well. I would recommend it. 
22521 4 A great piece of gear if you shoot in bright light. Use this on my Nikkor 70-300mm VR zoom lens on the beach and at sporting events and it really eliminates that &#34;washed out&#34; look. 
22522 4 LOVE this cute little camera & I ve owned several Canons, but they keep adding features & I love the wide-angle on this one!!! 
22523 4 Good battery that last three times as long as the factory battery, defiantly worth the buy!!! 
22524 4 Thank you 
22525 3 Good value. The case does not have a pocket for the extra battery and memory cards. 
22526 4 Exactly what I have been needing, highly portable, has own case. I love using this product. 
22527 3 It s not rock solid, and there is a few degrees of play in the head with the large Canon 100-400L lens attached, but it works and for the price it s very much better than the alternatives. Light and compact when folded. 
22528 2 Not as easy to focus as I thought it would be 
22529 4 So far this is my favorite lens for the micro four thirds system. 
22530 4 Excellent!,,Thank you 
22531 3 This unit if the fundamental starter for anyone who likes video &#34;on the go&#34;. It works well, takes clear images and sound. I haven t tested it underwater yet, but the tightly sealed case seems well built and solid; likely to work fine in wet/underwater conditions. 
22532 4 good and is very good in travel 
22533 3 good 
22534 3 Just right 
22535 4 Tough as a tank, plenty of space for my gear. 
22536 4 great 
22537 4 A wonderful piece of equipment. Still learning how to use it; much to learn. 
22538 4 very good price 
22539 3 Love the car adapter as many times we forget to charge the battery before we leave for something. Works perfectly with our cannon battery. No problems with it and it was a good price. 
22540 4 Excelente 
22541 4 A++++++++Highly Recommend 
22542 3 Holds the camera firmly in place Very good product 
22543 4 Very nice to use 
22544 4 Great Camera! 
22545 4 Cool thing! 
22546 4 Works really fine on my Canon 6D love it!!! 
22547 4 no complaints just wish it had an external mic jack 
22548 4 Good 
22549 3 I had a ND filter stuck on my 18-55 for months and this got it off in 5 seconds. Takes a little patience to align properly but it will take the filter right off. 
22550 2 As expected.. but not real detail on how to use. One of the items came broken. 
22551 4 Great 
22552 3 Works great and fits the Canon Camera. 
22553 0 This product is not worth the time. It came blurry a waste of money and I can t retrieve back because it came from out of the country. Please please please please don t waste your money. Sign Disappointed.!!!!! 
22554 3 Has lights to indicate power or surge(helpful during installation) 
22555 4 LEDs started burning up shortly after first use on my Nikon digital camera 
22556 4 Awesome assortment of tec stuff for the one who is starting! 
22557 4 Great pics,great packet value 
22558 4 Good 
22559 2 ok 
22560 4 thank you ever so much! 
22561 0 You can only stream video to your phone if you re on the same wifi. 
22562 1 NO SOUND ,NO BUY 
22563 4 Well worth the small investment to protect a large investment in camera and lens equipment. I hope I never need it but it s there when I really do. 
22564 4 looks great and takes great pictures 
22565 4 I actually took the foam insert out and use it to store fragile items (eg. Micro 4/3 lens) and it s really great for that. 
22566 3 Loved the attachments hated the ion air pro. Returned the action cam and kept the kit to use with another action cam. I hope I m making sense, but yeah. Good, really good. 
22567 3 Charger works good. Only issue I have is that it hardly holds the battery in place which can be a problem if you re charging in the car/on the go. 
22568 4 Fits like a glove. 
22569 4 It fits all my stuff. And it I don t carry my laptop then I put other papers in it. The memory card holder is secure. It s comfortable to wear. 
22570 1 Crashed each time I tried to install my SD cards. Uses a lot of broadband. Requires Flash in browsers. The picture was pretty good, but I couldn t deal with the other problems. Returning. 
22571 4 Excellent 
22572 4 Great price for legit equipment. It s amazing how much more you get in a shot with a 10mm versus 18mm. I m loving this lens and all of the extra goodies for not much extra are worth the small investment. 
22573 4 But this Light meter, Great for perfect flash! 
22574 4 It is a very profesional look article that helps a lot, for the price, I don t regret it at all, 
22575 3 Not user friendly, but I love a challenge. All the parts work fine. Hopefully I won t lose them. 
22576 4 Love this bag! Fits my Manfrotto with pistol grip no problem! Thanks! 
22577 0 Item arrived without mounting hardware or instructions. 
22578 4 Love this! So fun! 
22579 4 It works great with my ADT Safewatch Pro 3000. However setting the thing up with it was an absolute bear. Not the fault of the device. A fault with a ridiculously complex system for pairing it with the ADT equipment. 
22580 3 Way too much $$$ for this s***. 
22581 4 they work great!! very easy to work and set up!! Thanks Dan!! 
22582 4 A nice case but had to return because I returned the camera. 
22583 4 Love this camera and the telephoto lens. The lighter weight makes it perfect. I had a Canon years ago so the learning curve has been pretty easy. 
22584 4 This item allows me not only to see pictures on a bigger screen but also make me look like i spent a lot of cash to make my dslr different. 
22585 4 It was perfect just what I had expected. 
22586 3 Sony 28-2 is bright and clear for general purpose photography. But the images it produce, is nothing magical like the Leica Q with Summilux 28-1.7. Even at A7R2 s 42 megapixel, the images aren t as detailed as the Leica Q. 
22587 4 excelente producto recomendado 
22588 3 Had to place it on a stationary camera, it moves to much when trying to adjust the dim switch. 
22589 1 The issue is, that some of the screws that come with the prop guard don t fit. They aren t long enough and I can t get them to tighten the guard. So, I left the guard off the Phantom, which is not what I wanted. 
22590 4 excellent buy 
22591 0 Pictures did not develope well. Waste of money 
22592 3 good for what it is 
22593 4 bought it for my husband; he loves it; he s a bit taller than 6 feet so he prefer a very tall tripod and this is one I found on Amazon and very good price 
22594 0 Horrible! This is a gray market market (which means it s not from the U.S.) Nikon refuses to fix these camera if anything happens to them. I am very disappointed. 
22595 3 Good product.... 
22596 4 Love my GoPro. Made some great YouTube videos at beach and water park. 
22597 2 ok 
22598 4 Works and good price 
22599 4 Bought this for my Nikon 1 J4. It fits everything and then some! My camera, extra lens, battery charger, cables, extra memory cards all fit and I still have more space for other things. 
22600 4 Henry was very helpful in setting up my camera. I would recommend the Foscam cameras ! 
22601 0 This product was awful. Directions in English were poorly translated. Had to watch a you tube video and it looks like the guy could only make it work after he took it apart and jerry-rigged it. I threw mine away. 
22602 4 Cheap for all the pictures I got:) came in fast love them!!:) 
22603 4 Good carrying case that fits my Olympus SH-2 well. The extra pocket is useful for the tripod shoe, but not much else. Smaller items like spare SD cards or batteries would likely fall out. 
22604 4 Well-designed product. Fit perfectly and excellent quality 
22605 0 Horrible item. Broke within 2 weeks of occasional light use. Lost the $70 digital camera I just purchased in the river because this did not hold up at all. Very disappointing! Do not buy. 
22606 3 Worked well. 
22607 4 Good item and good price for it. 
22608 4 A good cheap wireless remote for the DSLRs. I used it for Canon 7D m2 and works very well. 
22609 4 The selfie stick works great. I even used it in the pool. The straps are great and I never have to worry about losing the camera. 
22610 0 Horrible. It worked 2 times. I went to use it again today, and it quit working. What a waste of money!!! 
22611 0 Junk---didn t work very long... 
22612 4 Great kit and great service :) 
22613 4 Great tripod! Thanks. 
22614 4 Yes, this is a great arm to attach my digital recorder to my video tripod, nice and solid. 
22615 0 This will not work for swann security system like advertised. I bought eight of these and they are junk. 4 didn t work at all. And 4 worked for a couple minutes. So I have 8 cords that I can t use. Do not buy. 
22616 4 A must for this camera !!! to make it truly bomb prof, not the prettiest thing but does the job. 
22617 4 Works great, no problems what so ever. Exactly like the battery that came with my camera. 
22618 4 Works absolutely amazing I have no complaints 
22619 4 Works very goodl. Delivers one time. 
22620 4 loved the different colors. so cute 
22621 4 very pleased! Good price on a great item! 
22622 4 I use the GoPole almost every time I use my GoPro. It is definitely a great accessory to have if you enjoy traveling and doing action sports. 
22623 4 Meets my expectations. A perfect size for days when. Don t need all my equipment. 
22624 4 Good to take along an extra eyecup when traveling since the Olympus eye cup tends to come off and disappear easily. 
22625 4 Nicely padded. Keeps my lenses safe! 
22626 2 The Lens was fairly OK but the out of body was more used than indicated. (faded) 
22627 4 It s a great camera, but the instructions are very básic 
22628 4 a 
22629 4 it to cool 
22630 4 Great camera and great value with the bundle. 
22631 4 Henry was very professional and gave great tech support. Thank you Henry !!!! 
22632 4 Works great on my canon 70d. So much better than a neck strap. No issues so far. Does not block the flip out screen. 
22633 4 Awesome Camera .... We love it. We own 2 other Sony Alpha that we use in our family photography business. The results are superb even with the kit lens. But with the ability to use FE and adapted lenses, you can get some mind blowing results from this camera. 
22634 2 found it to be too small to be very useful I bought and exclusively use the backpack from amazon: [[ASIN:B002VPE1WK AmazonBasics Backpack for SLR/DSLR Cameras and Accessories - Black]] 
22635 4 Very happy with this purchase, interesting design 
22636 4 Worked perfectly! 
22637 4 Literally fits like a GLOVE, very nice! 
22638 3 No comments 
22639 2 works as advertized and cheap 
22640 4 Literally no complaints. better than I expected! 
22641 0 dont work 
22642 3 This worked out great for my cannon. It s wasn t the exact charger I got for my cannon but it does the job. 
22643 4 Great lens for the money! Takes sharp pics over entire focal length. 
22644 4 Excellent for carrying my phantom 3 proffesional 
22645 4 Works great compact size fits on my backpack perfect 
22646 4 I love my vivitar battery and charger kit for my Sony NEX 5R camera. It works great and I received the items promptly. 
22647 4 The package arrived in time for my granddaughter s birthday. It was her birthday gift. She loved it.She took photos of her birthday party with it and everyone enjoyed the camera. 
22648 4 I Love It! Great Camera! 
22649 2 For the price, it is a very interesting lens. Personally, I don t have a lot of use for it, but it does have a very nice open aperture. 
22650 4 Very nice, the price was well worth it, in fact if bought separately I would have paid more than triple the price. Everything was nicely packed and I feel it was one of my best purchases I made for myself in awhile. 
22651 4 It s just what I wanted, pictures are sharp, it s easy to operate and its lightweight! 
22652 4 Excellent quality recommended seller 
22653 4 they work great 
22654 4 Worked on my Eviant 7&#34; TV - very happy. 
22655 2 it will do but it comes all folded up and looks completely fake. I will see how it photographs but doesn t look real at all. Very digital. 
22656 4 Love it 
22657 4 excellent! 
22658 3 Keeps the full batteries coming I love this tool. 
22659 4 Amazing item, delivered earlier than expected. The clap and goose neck are ver sturdy and made with good material, worth the buy to any one who wants to get great static vids with their gopro. 
22660 4 Definitely great for the price and gets the job done. Straps look pretty durable and I am sure with time and being out in the sun they will eventually break, but for the price I d replace them again in a heartbeat.Tested on variable length and prime lenses. 
22661 4 This is a very nice and comfortable wrist strap for those who do not like to use their neck straps! 
22662 4 May not be the most expensive glass out there, but this I ve never been disappointed in any HOYA product. True, I m not a professional, but I take care of my stuff ant HOYA works for me! 
22663 4 FAST DELIVERY&#62;&#62; wow! 
22664 3 Installed in minutes to replace an old sony system in my Monaco RV. Works good. 
22665 4 It does exactly what it needs to do. after hours of searching for cameras I found this one. it was very easy to install and the picture is very clear. If your making a decision, MUST BUY THESE CAMERAS. 
22666 2 resolution is not adjustable. remote didnot work OTB. 
22667 4 Works great. 
22668 2 ok 
22669 4 After several trys I finally found what I wanted. 
22670 3 Camera bag is very small. Everything else is about what you d expect for the price. 
22671 4 Love this camera but rather intimidated by all it can do. Not a beginner s camera! Will have to buy a book D3200 dummies book to be able to use it. 
22672 4 Exactly the same as the one I lost but easier to obtain and cheaper. 
22673 3 works good 
22674 4 Good camera. Clear picture. 
22675 4 Great value. 
22676 4 Great buy on good film! 
22677 4 LensPen always delivers! This one is much smaller than the previous model. Although I don t really like new curved design (I am a straight lines guy), but it does the job perfectly, as always! 
22678 4 Works great. 
22679 3 Works a treat. 
22680 4 Excellent, sturdy base. This thing is a rock. All the machining is beautifully precise. The head is very nice for still photography but too stiff for video. I mounted an inexpensive fluid head on the base and I m very happy. 
22681 3 Have taken some pretty awesome photos with this film it never fails me! 
22682 4 Works Great. 
22683 2 Kind of delicate. 
22684 4 I only needed one of these in my GoPro camera cases on my dive trip for 16 dives. I am careful with my cameras and this was extra insurance. I had no fogging at all. I inserted them just below the camera after i placed the camera in the case. 
22685 4 I ve been using it for 2 weeks, and i love it. I would buy this again, as well as recomend it to friends. 
22686 0 not real eos bag,smelling too much and too small to hold dslr 
22687 4 Great price Amazing quality 
22688 4 Item as described 
22689 4 Love this camera. I m still trying to figure out the basics of photography. Once I get those down pat, I m going to really love it! 
22690 3 I ran a mud run with this and it stayed very secure. I think the top strap helps keep the camera from flopping around as much but I wasn t able to tighten it as much as I would have liked. Great product for the price though. 
22691 4 works great; timely and well padded shipping; would buy again 
22692 4 it exceeded my expectations. Great light, easy to use and very economical. Already suggested it to few artists friends of mine. 
22693 2 Lightweight and thus does not hold to the windshield very well. I love the picture and clarity=-colors are terrific. 
22694 1 Quality is what you d expect from this price point and size, and is acceptable. But the battery lasted for only two short uses before it wouldn t hold a charge. 
22695 4 High quality and will buy again. This was able to fit all my DSLR and GoPro items in one place. Now I just need to grab the pack and go. 
22696 4 I love it I use in my strobe lite and my speedlite. 
22697 3 LOOKS LIKE THE REAL CAMERAS , GOOD VALUE 
22698 4 A+++++ fast shipping product as described. 
22699 2 wooks 
22700 3 Very pleased with this! Would have given 5 stars if it came with instructions on unfolding and refolding tent. 
22701 4 Not bad for that money. 
22702 4 The are really high quality accessories for your camera. I have purchased several and am quite happy with them. 
22703 4 Worked great on our family vacation to Hawaii. My husband recorded our entire trip from start to finish with his fancy usie stick and Go Pro. We ended up with a really cool video of our trip. Great little pole mount. 
22704 4 I ve lost several microfiber cloths in the past so this 6-pack is great for having extras when needed. I like that they come individually wrapped and it cleans my glasses perfectly. I m very happy with it. 
22705 4 Great camera case! Lots of storage spaces. 
22706 4 perfect student camera! 
22707 4 Very nice gear. Part of the collection of accessories to have if you are a photographer. Loved the price, weight and features, hard to beat for the money. 
22708 0 No good n o good takes to long 
22709 4 small footprint and strong love this thing 
22710 4 Not too big. Everything in one place with easy access. 
22711 3 I favor Tiffen s quality. 
22712 3 It s very nice, works really well 
22713 4 Great product, super cute designs 
22714 1 You get what you pay for, cheap quality, feels like 
22715 4 I like it a lot -- great zoom, and easy to work. 
22716 4 Shipping rather slow, but i am extremely happy with purchase. 
22717 4 Great product. 
22718 4 Did its job! 
22719 4 Me and my husband bought this as our birthday gift to our 11yr old daughter, Our daughter is very happy. This bundle includes everything that you need to make memorable pictures. Worth the price. Awesome product. 
22720 4 Great 
22721 4 Recommend!!!!!!!! 
22722 4 Item as described and arrived quickly. 
22723 4 The oversize version of the eyecup works exceptionally well with eyeglass wearers. Shuts out distracting light, esp. on sunny days. 
22724 4 This is the 1st tripod I ve ever bought. I am very happy with it - easy to carry around easy to get the camera on easy to change the height. 
22725 4 High quality. 
22726 4 Lost the original cord to my Sony and this came super fast and was exactly what I needed! 
22727 3 I just bought this bag for my DSLR and initially it looks great, feels comfortable, is light weight etc. The only thing that is missing is the bottom pocket for a monopod and an integrated rain cover. That s why I m giving it 4 stars. 
22728 4 Works perfectly, just what I needed 
22729 4 Such great quality picture on this thing. Love it!!! 
22730 4 Kenneth, my customer service technician was terrific. He got my up and running in 5 minutes and the camera is working great now. 
22731 4 Like it hope it lasts as long as my last one did 
22732 2 Zippers are really cheap and 1 out of 2 broke. Still worth using with 1 zipper. 
22733 0 Not compatible with Genie garage door motor. 
22734 4 Very satisfied 
22735 4 Works as it should. 
22736 4 nice 
22737 0 Not usable due to its a new product and not recognized by softwear...since only support is in JAPAN it is impossible to get help. Do not buy!! 
22738 4 This camera is perfect for our young photographer 
22739 4 It is what it is. Used it for GoPro 4 black and my Shoei RF-1200. Works. 
22740 4 The camera is a good fit for our need and I like the recording quality of the footage. 
22741 4 enjoy the way it develops picture 
22742 4 It is a good product, and not expensive. 
22743 1 I ordered just the bar mount and it is huge. I don t even know what bar it would go around. It is definitely not what is pictured. 
22744 4 Excellent range; easy to install and the inside alarm is loud enough to hear over dogs, children and TV! 
22745 4 My son gets so much use out of it. Makes me wonder how I got by as a kid with the crappy technology we had. 
22746 4 work great got to me fast! 
22747 4 Works great and doesn t cost nearly what the Canon branded product did. 
22748 4 As shown! Met my expectations. An all-around good buy! 
22749 4 These work great. Have had fun playing with the macro. 
22750 4 Daughter enjoying this gift! 
22751 4 My camera case was exactly as described in the ads; arrived on time; makes shopping a lot easier with this kind of service 
22752 3 Works okay. 
22753 0 Cheap, the plastic inside that holds the ink so when you turn it it ll come out - came broke. So I cant even use it as a pen. The camera points way high so it doesnt even work if you have it in your shirt pocket. 
22754 3 Great product. Did what I needed it to do. Just wish the cameras would adjust the zoom. There to close 
22755 4 very very cool!!! 
22756 2 Flys and takes video great, but you cant take it over 500 ft. The older ones you could take well over 1k feet. 
22757 4 My favorite mount now, can be angled just about any direction you will need. Quality is good. 
22758 0 So disappointed. The pictures weren t high quality. And it was so smart, but I couldn t figure out how to sync everything. I quickly gave up and went back to using my phone for everything. 
22759 4 Lens works great! For its price it s definitely worth the money. 
22760 2 Good price. I wouldn t check it on an airline but it s good for taking the drone places. 
22761 3 Its hard to find anything when not on the plate but overall a great little scope. 
22762 4 Very nice basic lens hood 
22763 4 This is the second one of these we bought. Gave our &#34;pro-sumer&#34; camera much better audio capability. Beware! The 1/8th inch audio in is mono. Using this unit you can input two XLR lines into a camera with only 1/8th in stereo input. And you can balance them during operation. 
22764 4 It is awesome! I love this camera! I use it all the time! 
22765 4 It s a go light product. The name and product speaks for itself self 
22766 1 To short creeps down the lens. Needs a rubber type material on inside to grip lens barrel so it will stay put. It is built good but doesn t stay on. 
22767 4 Henry was very helpful. he not only fixed my issue buy did resolve some issues i was having on my pc aswell. very knowledgeable on the product, very happy with company. thanks Henry 
22768 4 Great camera. Great price. 
22769 0 Lights are ok. But the rest of the kit is complete garbage. You get less than what you pay for, you re better off investing in a higher quality built light tent than this kit. 
22770 4 Very happy with my camera package! The only thing that bummed me was i received the case with the zipper jumped off track and doesn t close in the corners. But that s why the front clips are great! VERY happy. 
22771 3 After losing lens cap I now know the importance of using one, the lens cap fits perfectly. The sticky thing is supposed to stick to the cap - good luck with that. 
22772 0 Very flimsy and not supportive 
22773 0 Poor quality video .Hard to load onto computer. 
22774 4 Bought for my sisters birthday/moving away present! She loves it! 
22775 4 Love it! It is sturdy enough for a phone. If extended, fully, i would just take care not to bump it. It is light weight aluminum. Still...a great product, for the price. 
22776 4 Great buy it looks and feels original and fits my lens perfectly this is a 67mm lens cap I use for my 18-140 nikon lens. 
22777 4 Very handy to have without carrying extra pieces of equipment. 
22778 4 Awesome product. i always get great quality when i buy Tiffen 
22779 4 Very nice as a camera bag and room for a wallet. 
22780 4 Works great!!! 
22781 4 Fit perfectly! 
22782 0 does nothing it says it does 
22783 4 Ok 
22784 4 Works as expected 
22785 4 This package has so many stuff that there are so some accessories that I don t even know what they re for. 
22786 4 Great product at such a discounted price. Fits snug around my GoPro 4 Black Edition and still provides easy access to ports & SD card. 
22787 4 Excellent value! 
22788 4 I Love this camera. It works so nice. This camera video quality amazing. It is perfect camera for video. 
22789 3 Awesome value for the money. Light, sturdy enough for basic photography. 
22790 3 Setup was easy (once the wires were run). Great resolution for this price point and the Android app is pretty good. Only negative is that the mouse that came with the DVR requires a lot of force to click the buttons. 
22791 4 Very comfortable and looks great too! 
22792 4 Great! Works well and will come in handy for so many situations. 
22793 4 Had one before - lost it and thought enough of the performance and fun to buy a replacement of the same product 
22794 4 Great product 
22795 4 Works perfectly in my video camera. 
22796 4 They work great. Cons: Not enough range for my application, but they work well. They Need to come with power adapters, they use a LOT of batteries. 
22797 3 included battery lasted about 3 hours, functions ok with new $7 battery 
22798 4 Works Great for making porno s 
22799 4 These fit perfectly, went on easily.. I don t know how well they hold up, but unless they re a total disaster, they re a great buy. 
22800 3 Works well for CCTV cams 
22801 4 came home from outing and the package(CAMERA)was sitting outside my door!it was worth the wait. Mahalo for your persistence and tenacity! mahalo nui loa!!!! rty. 
22802 4 Works great on Canon lenses. The attachment string is also long enough for a zoom lens mounted on the caner. 
22803 4 I Love my Nikon 810 camera. Clear images..and can handle dark areas with high ISO. I am a photographer and use it everyday. 
22804 0 Do not buy this item. Did not work as described or at all, in fact. 
22805 4 Works how it should, high quality! 
22806 4 Literally perfect 
22807 4 Good 
22808 4 The Phantom 3 is awesome! Check this out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LW509QAZH6o&feature=youtu.be 
22809 4 Good! Easy installation and setup, reasonable price, nice pix. 
22810 4 i wouldn t trust the reviews of an amazon purchase for a 3K camera, but i love it. 
22811 1 should have bought OEM unit - name brand...you get what you pay for - if you only look at price then its a good unit 
22812 4 great products. Thanks 
22813 4 Fits perfect 
22814 3 The product arrived on schedule, charged in my Canon charger, fits the camera and appears to be as advertised. I will be using it to have a second battery during an upcoming vacation. 
22815 4 lots of fun ways to use GoPro 
22816 4 Fits perfectfly with the GoPro Hero 4 Black. 
22817 4 Fits well, does what it s supposed to do. 
22818 4 Better Than Expected 
22819 4 Very good 
22820 4 camera will not hold a charge but the film paper is fine 
22821 3 cool camera. only thing is doesn t come with film. you have to buy it separately 
22822 3 okay material, but good for the price. 
22823 0 82-77mm step down adapter does not fit the Tamron 70-200 f/2.8 which is 77mm. 
22824 4 These cloths are just what I was looking for. They are not thin cloths, there s weight to them. I love how large they are especially when cleaning my eyeglasses. I highly recommend these. 
22825 4 For the price, a pretty good camera. Surprisingly good night vision for single IR led. 
22826 4 Great. Arrived as promisef 
22827 3 I m not going to lie, i was disappointed that the Blue wasn t like the picture! It s a lot darker but haven t had the pleasure in really using the Tripod but so far it seems really sturdy 
22828 4 This is a pretty great little product here! It is strong and sturdy. I use it with a canon rebel and it works perfectly. 
22829 4 Nice fit, slim profile 
22830 4 its perfect, super cute and fits camera nicely, it will surely protect it 
22831 2 Need to know how to really work it.... 
22832 3 Pretty well, is what I wanted. Fits perfect in my manfrotto shoulder brace. The chapest and confidence image stabilizer ever 
22833 4 its better than original canon 
22834 0 Could not get it to work. 
22835 4 Vincent was an expert at getting my cameras to show on my phones. He took the time to explain everything perfectly! Thank you! 
22836 4 This is made very well, and has a quick set up design that is extremely secure... 
22837 4 Love this tripod. Purchased it to use with my Nikon Camera and Im very content with it. 
22838 4 eyepiece set is good.. need to add a barlow and some other parts in the case. 
22839 4 Love this camera. It s great for someone like me who needs to rely on the autofocus feature. The zoom is powerful and takes clear shots. 
22840 4 They work fine. Very happy with them 
22841 1 Lags & it sucks. 
22842 4 I bought this kit for my daughter s Nikon D50 camera. It worked perfectly while she was a way at Photography camp and every time since. 
22843 0 Waste of money. Will fall off at the slightest movement. Should have purchased the Nikon hood. 
22844 4 It works for my use, not as a piece of camera parts. 
22845 4 Great quality product. 
22846 0 Too short of a chord. REturned 
22847 2 mediocore 
22848 4 Everything fits perfect, no complaints. 
22849 4 Great camera, FOSCAM remote installer, Walter took care of business right away. The whole set up was about 5 minutes. 
22850 4 worked perfectly 
22851 3 I think this kit is very good. Has most options that you would use though I tend to use the 18-140mm most of all. I have changed the filters to the better but the one provided are reasonable. 
22852 4 just as described. 
22853 4 Sturdy, no issues and has all pieces to easily use with your GoPro. Love it! 
22854 4 Bought to store my ultra light fishing reels. Works just fine as I expected, no more worries when traveling. 
22855 4 Love it!!! I also love that it comes with a strap 
22856 4 Effective. Work great. 
22857 4 I ve used these for years. Best generic battery out there 
22858 3 easy to use 
22859 4 Works as described. Great value. 
22860 4 I love it 
22861 4 small but works well 
22862 4 I am SHOCKED at how well thay work for the money! I have a old canon rebel that gets no respect and they did a great job on a filthy sensor. 
22863 4 good capacity, good delivery 
22864 3 works well 
22865 4 Works great 
22866 4 Excelent product! 
22867 3 Does what it s suppose to do... Wish it was easier to install and uninstall without using tools.. but not bad. 
22868 4 I love this battery!! Easy to understand what s going on, holds charge well, and charges my full size Asus ultrabook to about 100% once with a full charge - all I need. So far, it never got uncomfortably warm either. Now I *never* have to stop working! Oh, wait... 
22869 4 Great selection for my camera! 
22870 4 Awesome batteries. I get over 5 hours of recording time on my Canon Vixia HF M41 with one battery. The car charger is a great addition to my kit. Probably a dozen cycles on one of the batteries so far and I m getting full charges quickly. Great package. 
22871 4 Everything works well. 
22872 4 Since I got my GoPro 4, I ve bought quite a few filters & junk. Out of everything this is one of my favorites! 
22873 4 Much sturdy than the plastic one I had before. Three level adjusting legs can make it very tall. I haven t figure out how to use the reverse function. But it fits all my needs now. I m happy with it. 
22874 2 Good price to scare off thief who try to break into your house.

22876 4 This camera is so cute and so good! 
22877 4 Perfect condition. 
22878 4 Got the camera to keep tabs on the animals while we re out and it works fantastic. It was very easy to set up on my Android phone and the video quality is very good. 
22879 3 Great value for the price. Purchased as a gift so wanted to load some photos onto product before giving. Found the remote a little unresponsive at times. Picture quality and display vary depending on quality of original data loaded onto frame. 
22880 1 Well almost everything is good, it just the 4 spliter adaptor is not working only if i bend it , i don t know why. Thanks 
22881 4 I bought this career to remote control my dog when I m not at home. It works perfectly. easy to apply and the quality of pics are great!! highly recommend!! 
22882 4 these are great for the buck 
22883 2 worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks. 
22884 3 great 
22885 4 Can be a little hard to view the screen in bright sunlight even when screen is set to its brightest.. 
22886 4 So many options! Going to take some time to learn to use it. 
22887 4 Exactly as advertised!!! Quick shipment+++ 
22888 3 Love this bag! 
22889 4 Great product! I have it on my front porch and I have the base hooked up about 100ft away in my shop. Yes, there is the occasional false alarm, but not often. Has lasted 2 winters and 2 summers in the South. 
22890 4 Good 
22891 4 Love it! 
22892 4 terrific 
22893 4 Great price and product arrive perfectly. 
22894 3 The sound isn t the best 
22895 1 It doesn t work for canon, i didn t realize. Trigger should do its job when it s not attached to the camera, but it doesn t. I guess it works for nikon though. 
22896 4 Great product! Used it for a trip to Costa Rica and it was awesome. I d definitely recommend this product and seller :) 
22897 0 does not work. Can only get red light after 4 hours of charging and inserting an sd mini card. Could not do any recording and computer does not recognize the glasses as the instruction say. 
22898 4 I attached it on my Dicapac WP-ONE Point & Shoot Digital Camera Waterproof Case with Canon powershot S95. It was perfect for snorkeling. I love it! 
22899 0 Had to return it. I bough it for my wedding and all the images came blurry. The quality is appalling. 
22900 4 It works flawless without network drops. Excellent video Quality 
22901 4 Cannot be beat for the price. 
22902 4 I purchased these for my iPad, but can use them for so many things! 
22903 4 Connected it with my dvr, it has sharp image at day and at night. Good experience. 
22904 1 After 1 and a half year of use, 5 cameras dont work anymore. They were profesionally wired and indoors. 
22905 0 Not original 
22906 4 Being able to handle a picture to each person really made the photo booth a success 
22907 4 Very good 
22908 4 works fine 
22909 4 Perfect sized bag and cush enough for my Nikon D3300 and extras 
22910 4 Excellent..... and very prompt devilery 
22911 4 This is awesome. I wanted to be able to take pictures while in New York without having to hand my several hundred dollar camera to a pickpocket or thief. This allowed me to take pictures and remember my trip without having to bring someone else or have my camera stolen. 
22912 4 Perfect 
22913 0 Used once and it cant charge anymore.....became trash.. sigh... 
22914 4 great condition , very clear optics 
22915 4 I left this case on the back of my truck and when I drove off it fell off onto the highway. It got run over and I went back to check it out and he case did its job. My gopro is perfectly fine 
22916 4 I now always have a spare. Reasonable price. 
22917 4 Perfect and just what I needed for my camera!!! 
22918 3 Thank you, very happy with the management of purchase - sale. 
22919 4 i have worn this pin to work once a week for the past year & I wash it in the laundry. It hasn t lost its color & is still as cute as ever. Highly recommend! 
22920 0 This camera takes a few pictures and then the lens gets stuck and says lens error, no wonder it was so cheap! 
22921 4 Battery works fine. I use it as a back up and have not tested the battery life. 
22922 4 Fit GPS, seems to work properly. 
22923 4 Perfect item worx great THNX 
22924 4 Works great, all my fd lens work well with it so far 
22925 4 I love this flash, helps me take great pics! 
22926 3 Smart Majic in Photo and Video Technology 
22927 4 Great film! 
22928 4 Item delivered on time and as described. 
22929 4 The pack rocks, I have purchased 2 more and- 2- 360 light units at 72 years old I no longer have a desire to carry heavy light sets and stands. Everything goes into one rolling case stands,lights,boxes, brellas,etc cables, and packs. everything I need 
22930 3 Looks real enough, but the batteries on the larger cameras wear out quickly! 
22931 3 I first received the wrong product, was completely disappointed. Immediately, returned it. Received the correct product quickly (in time for my trip) and am VERY happy. Great quality bag! It is awesome for what I need! 
22932 4 Awesome little cloths! got the for my touch screen laptop to remove finger prints and it works great! started using one for my phone too and it keeps it looking clean 
22933 4 Works straight out of the box with both my Canon 430EX II and Vivitar s 285V s. 
22934 3 Pretty decent close up lens and exceptional value. I find it works best by selecting one of the three parts, maybe two, but haven t found a need for all 3 in combination yet, if that s even possible. 
22935 4 Love love love this tripod. It s light and still sturdy. I use this almost every day. I have a Droid Turbo and it holds it nicely and the remote works perfectly with it. I highly recommend this product. 
22936 4 Worked perfect it was great using my camera again after so long 
22937 4 If it had the Wi-Fi camera and longer lasting batteries, I would consider it perfect. 
22938 0 I was missing the bolt for the micro macro lens could not fit the adapter on 
22939 3 works good 
22940 2 The Table Top shooting cube is fine but the four backgrounds were folded into 6&#34; squares that are difficult to impossible to get rid of the folds. The really should roll them up. 
22941 4 Like others, my only complaint is that you could place the battery in backwards. Not sure if that s an issue, the charger might have reverse polarity protection? Batteries work well, charger works well. 
22942 4 Cute :) 
22943 4 Exceeded my expectations. I ve been using everything for several months and.no problems. Glad I saved money and didn t buy the gopro kits for 3x the price. 
22944 4 Great replacement charger. Works fine and does a fine job. 
22945 4 Works well and solidly built. 
22946 4 Henry :did an outstanding job helping me set up my F19821W camera for both wireless operation & remote access. I am very pleased with the customer service and the camera. 
22947 4 Great alternative to the comparable Nikon lens for a fraction of the cost. It s a bit noisy, but that doesn t bother me. 
22948 0 dvr does not give signal to LG monitor. cable is good.but does not operate. when turn on zmodo logo appear that says loading, then turn black with wording no signal., cannot get help from support. 
22949 4 Worked exactly how it is suppose to. I was kind of scared because of such a low price, but it worked like a charm! 
22950 0 Film wasn t developing properly or not at all. Film may have been too old. 
22951 4 I hope my gopro never falls off in the ocean, but at least I now know it ll be up on the surface when I go looking for it. 
22952 4 A+ 
22953 4 Does what it says on the box 
22954 4 Works great 
22955 4 Excellent product! provides great visibility while protecting copter from noob damage. Installation tip, lay thick towel on flat service and flip copter without props. This will keep all your motors in alignment. 
22956 3 The back protector works great however the top screen protector does not fit perfect since it is flat and the screen on the camera is a little rounded. 
22957 3 Gets the job done without any hastle. I love being able to use my gopro on a tripod. 
22958 3 It charges the batteries fine, but have not used the camera enough to need extra batteries yet. 
22959 4 Absolutely what I wanted! 
22960 4 nice compact camera with hight Mega pixels 
22961 4 Met my needs and expectations and the price was really good. 
22962 4 Camera is fantastic and the package was a great deal. Recommend! 
22963 4 Great 
22964 4 Great camera for summer fun! Works well underwater and outdoors. Very durable. ..it has survived many water slides and works perfectly (even after being dropped a few times by my child). 
22965 4 The little camera that could! Great, crisp picture. The only downside is the talking feature. It is so quiet my dogs can barely hear me when I talk through it! 
22966 4 It does what it s supposed to do. Installed on Nikon D750. 
22967 3 Pictures are not big enough, I bought the 300 wide two weeks later 
22968 4 Great camera, consistent 
22969 3 Good 
22970 1 Very blurry and slow. 
22971 4 The perfect flash backup. I shoot Nikon and use a Nikon SB-910. I needed more flash units for off camera use and this product works great with my Nikon system. Will most likely order more so I have plenty. 
22972 4 works very well. shipped quick and I am very pleased with the quality and construction. 
22973 3 Not as easy to program as hope. 
22974 4 These are just wonderful. With the border s finish, they don t leave any lints hanging. The simili-suede just grabs dust and lint and doesn t smear like tome cheaper cloths. Great value that I highly recommend. 
22975 4 Quality Nikon product at a good price 
22976 4 More than I expected. Thanks 
22977 4 The camera was all that was advertised. Took me a bit to figure out all the gadgets that came with it, but I did. Camera takes very high quality photos. I am very pleased with my purchase. 
22978 4 Great item, great price, quick delivery. 
22979 4 Lost my original one so this one will fasten on to the strap., 
22980 4 works perfect. battery charge status shows up. 
22981 4 great 
22982 4 Works great has a great range 
22983 4 Excellent product. Thanks! 
22984 4 works as advertised good customer support. 
22985 1 Can t usually get it to stay straight so the flash actually hits the softbox correctly. 
22986 4 great fit and finish, no complaints here 
22987 4 It meets my needs 
22988 4 I just got into the hobby, and didn t want to spend a lot of money on eyepiece s just yet. This was the right upgrade for me! 
22989 4 I purchased these cleaning cloths based on previous reviews and I do not regret! Great quality and good value! 
22990 3 It s okay, but not in love with GoPro style mounts in general. 
22991 4 Just received the camera. Took just a couple of pictures and I am very pleased. At first I found it a little hard to center the pictures but I think I am getting the hang of it now. Bonnie 
22992 4 It s great.. and I m sure that it s amazing. Thank you for getting it here on time. See you guys soon. 
22993 4 Purchased the RFN-4s for my Nikon D800 fitting was easy to fit and worked straight from the box. Would thoroughly recommend this product. 
22994 2 FOR THE PRICE NOT BAD !! 
22995 4 Yes, I like this camera, its perfect for my real estate work. Good quality, and my 2nd Coolpix. 
22996 4 Have had the camera for 1 week and am amazed at the quality of the images. Have hand held low light images at 720mm equivalent and gotten clear sharp images, wow! Other low light images have been equally impressive. I suspect that I will never use the flash. 
22997 3 Great lens 
22998 3 This is my favorite 2x3 instant camera, only surpassed by the Fuji Instax 300 for the picture size. 
22999 4 Shipped fast and item works as stated. I like the compact design. Easy to fold up and carry along for a shoot. 
23000 0 I never got the darn thing to work. I didn t return it either because it was cheaply priced and not worth the hassle. 
23001 4 Wonderful cleaning cloths. Great company. Would buy again. 
23002 4 Very good product and good picture quality 
23003 0 One of the batteries came with defect and it doesn t hold the charge... 
23004 4 Came in on time. Was able to charge the camera before going see the baby thanks. 
23005 1 The tripod itself was great but the quick release came broken I can t put the plate back on. Now I have to by a whole new ball head. The price to ship it back is just to much hassle. 
23006 0 Not good 
23007 4 Great entry level camera. Decent quality. I love having it for off-road and rally cross races. I wish the battery life was a little better, but since it can record while charging, I just leave it hooked up in the car. 
23008 4 great product thank you 
23009 3 Little bit of a tight fit, also don t try to remove it from the case its very hard to get back in. The case fits my Hero 4 Silver great but the rubber with most 3rd party cases is thicker and harder to close. But overall great. 
23010 4 Pelican quality always. Sold on quality and long lasting. We use about 20 cases with our equipt. 
23011 4 Fits like a charm. Exactly what I needed when mine fell off my Canon XSi. 
23012 4 Worked great on my camera very happy 
23013 3 Great novelty gift. Don t expect clear digital quality pics however. Fun camera to take to parties and gatherings. 
23014 4 Very nice price. 
23015 4 Great product...most others have a short range, but I have tried this one at 140 feet and it still works! 
23016 4 Good 
23017 2 Fits well and works with the metering system (aperture priority) of the camera. However, I don t understand why the camera (Fuji) side is plastic and the lens side metal. Other adapters have metal on both sides. Can t they match metal to Fuli X mounts? Curious. 
23018 4 Zmodo makes the best camera system on the market for the money. I ve had several of these models for many years. 
23019 2 Good for the price. However you can t see pictures outside because of the sun glare on the screen. 
23020 3 the flash is not Polaroid as in the picture, the filters lens aren t filters, just 4 diferent close-up lens.. everything else was cool.. 
23021 4 Great 
23022 4 Was a replacement for one that stopped working. 
23023 3 seems to work fine...a little tight fitting 
23024 2 Did not work but it may be a problem with laptop and not the charger purchased. Have not determined yet. Arrived fine and no problem with transaction though 
23025 4 Worked great 
23026 2 I m not sure the one I got is a Watson. It doesn t say Watson anywhere and just looks like a cheap fuji ripoff. It seems to work okay and fit for now. 
23027 4 good yes!!!!!!!!!! 
23028 4 A very nice, very functional, full featured camera, in a compact package. A keeper! 
23029 2 It works great to activate shutter and video record but their is no option to adjust shutter, iso or aperture so you still have to touch your camera even when you have this remote. I wish it had all the functionalists. 
23030 1 Decent cams. Very easy to install. Had to return, one s night vision stopped working after 2.5 wks. You can only view day time. 
23031 0 Not working @ all..not even 30 days & now I have 2 return it. 
23032 4 Works great! 
23033 3 Fine product, not sure how good this glass is but it works and my pics look a lot crispier and warm and I get to show the awesome blue Florida and Puerto Rican skies and puffy clouds. 
23034 4 The Vivitar Dual Action Lightning and Motion is a great devise for shooting lightning during the night. Needs some practice to figure out the sensitivity adjustments. Thanks Amazon for your awesome service and promptitiude as well as you did many times for me. 
23035 4 Ordered extra batteries for my new camera. Arrived quickly and work perfect. Thank you. 
23036 4 good 
23037 4 Does what it s made for 
23038 4 You get whet you pay for, so this works fine at this price. 
23039 3 Finally I can store all my camera stuff in one place!! this is a very nice bag with lots of room for my &#34;stuff&#34;, and it arranges nicely with compartment dividers that are movable. 
23040 4 Fun for a party. Film was fresh and easy to use. Great picture quality. 
23041 4 The Rokinon Cine Series are a great value. Perfect for the low to mid-budget filmmaker. 
23042 3 The first picture got stuck and ruined in both cartridges. 
23043 4 Great product & service 
23044 4 Description matched product. Was a perfect fit for our overhead projector. 
23045 0 Not the item pictured! This is a single pocket wizard for Einstein mono lights only. I should have read the description. 
23046 4 This is the best camera I ever owned. Makes you wonder why hauling a massive camera makes any sense. Seems stupid now that I have this one. Let s see the death of massive SLR cameras! 
23047 1 you get what you pay... 
23048 4 I absolutely love this quadcopter. My main use for it is photography and the turtle mode allows for slow and predictable movement. 
23049 0 One sided, off centered. Not as described. There are many other sellers selling much better straps for the same price 
23050 2 not for dslrs rigged or with heavy lenses, may need some fiddling or twiking to make it reliable ! 
23051 4 Like it and recommend for those who doesn t have a studio flashes 
23052 4 Great Camera. I have given up on my big DSLR cameras. I make big 16X20 or 16X24 inch prints and they are great. 
23053 3 Love this viewfinder, just wish it worked with my new GH4. 
23054 4 Works great with Pisector GS08 console. I lost my original one and was able to connect this one to my system in a matter of minutes. Pisector customer service is always really responsive and helpful if you have questions about compatibility with their systems, sensors, remotes, etc. 
23055 0 Complete Garbage 
23056 0 Terrible camera shaky video grainy I bought two and I m sorry threw away the boxes or I would have sent them back not even close to my go pro 
23057 4 one battery has lasted for a few months already in my dog s bark collar, with no sign of slowing down yet 
23058 4 I like the quality of this tripod. Not plastic like other moderately priced tripods. I especially like the ease of adjustments and love that it can be close to ground level as I enjoy photographing snowflakes. 
23059 4 Needed storage for my memory and I have always liked this memory holder. 
23060 4 very good 
23061 4 I m so pleased with the product and the speedily delivery! Great doing business with, I highly recommend! 
23062 4 Very user friendly. Excellent color. Like it much better than my canon. 
23063 0 not usefull 
23064 4 This product is excellent value I am very pleased with it. There are lots of pieces in this kit including several cloths, lens cleaning fluid and tissue, a blower and brushes. Did a nice job cleaning my camera lenses and filters. Best value hands down. 
23065 0 It fit in the charger but would not power up my camera. 
23066 2 It s nice quality but I thought it was a longer pole. I should of paid better attention when I ordered it. 
23067 2 Just what we wanted. 
23068 4 great product and have bought again based on good performance 
23069 0 Terrible Product. Not stable at all. 
23070 4 good 
23071 4 Excellent product 
23072 4 I read lots of reviews before ordering this. I hooked it up and took some shots at home right away and it worked great, comes in a nice carrying case also. Will work great for catch light. 
23073 4 Great viewing and quality for the price. Very happy with the binoculars! Use it for the horse track and watching birds. 
23074 4 Works great. Even fits over my life jacket when I used it on the water 
23075 4 Worked as advertised. Took the scare away from those snorkeling trips over deep reefs where I previously worried about losing my $400 camera. Also got some cool video in a lake by letting it float upside down by itself and get visits from the resident fish. 
23076 3 GREAT CAMERA! 
23077 4 Just what I needed! 
23078 4 one of the best gadget so far! thank you for your great customer service! appreciate it 
23079 4 Love this! 
23080 4 Awesome product my nephew absolutely loves it! Excellent value and high quality made. 
23081 4 Good lens 
23082 0 Doesn t work with Applie PC 
23083 3 The product good value for money. Although it needs a faster net connection, it works average on standard speed. Image quality fair Motion detection alarm a bit complex to set. 
23084 4 Love this case keep all my essential accessories in one place and super portable very strong 
23085 4 worked great with D3200, allows you to set interval and or duration. 
23086 4 They re microfiber cloths, what s there to review? 
23087 4 These are fantastic. I ve used other microfiber screen cleaning cloths before, but these are amazingly better. 
23088 4 I love it. 
23089 0 Used this flash for one shoot--then it died. Was hoping for more out of this product. Usually I don t have issues with this brand. 
23090 4 It was great 
23091 4 Great picture quality with this lens. 
23092 3 The product was received in very good time, I think it was a day early. Packaging was very appropriate and no complaints about the product as it was exactly as expected. 
23093 4 Perfect to fix stripped tripod mount 
23094 4 Excellent product!!! AAA fast delivery! 
23095 4 Everything was perfect! 
23096 4 Everything I expected it to be! 
23097 4 Excellent lens, 5 years warranty, great for my Nikon cameras. 
23098 4 KAZA filters are excellent choices and have a great price. I look forward to using this filter on my Canon lens. 
23099 4 Très bon 
23100 4 This is exactly what I needed for a camera that was given to me. I can now use this excellent camera because I now have the right charger. 
23101 4 Great deal! 
23102 4 the camera is great shot so fast unlike eny other camera at that price, the bundel is a real added valeu, thogh it wood be nice if there are 2 extra battery because the camera consume the energy quite fast 
23103 3 Did the trick ..fixed our lens with the help of youtube and a fraction of the cost of taking it in. 
23104 3 I ve taken some great shots with this, couldn t be happier. 
23105 4 This is a perfect travel lens. It has a very large range, but is relatively light weight. 
23106 4 Certainly worth the money, I recommend it! 
23107 4 I use this a a portable Chromakey system and it works great. With two people, it s easy to lean against the wall. With a little practice, folding goes smoothly. 
23108 3 Very nice. Might buy another one. Very quick and easy set up. Added a nice soft light to photos. 
23109 4 It was nice 
23110 3 Nice group of accessories, don t know if I will use them all, but it will be cheaper in the end than purchasing separately. 
23111 4 Used this (in my fanny pack) my whole 2 week Disney stay and it was nice and compact and light but hard enough that I knew my camera was safe. 
23112 4 For $20, this microphone is phenomenal. I can play ukulele while recording my own voice and even sound distribution is given to both. 
23113 4 Perfect for street photography and to take on vacations. I didn t use any of my other lenses on my last trip to NYC. Very lightweight and portable, it doesn t draw any attention. Silent and fast focus. Very pleased. 
23114 4 Once I learned to use it I love it. 
23115 4 Price and quality were both excellent. 
23116 4 Perfect flash, never failed and doesn t cost an arm and leg like the other named branded flashes 
23117 4 Works Great 
23118 4 great battery 
23119 4 Haven t used this a ton but it seems really good quality and it is nice that the whole camera holding assembly moves on the strap 
23120 4 Very good 
23121 4 Held battery life to expectation, isn t too heavy, does the job. It ll do. 
23122 4 Match the body of my camera! 
23123 2 No RGB values for color squares. No PDF of manual. 
23124 4 I toss it into my backpack every time I go hiking and never have to worry about my filters getting scratched or lost. 
23125 4 Good, inexpensive! 
23126 4 It works as advertised 
23127 1 Dropped connection, can t get it back 
23128 4 Great price, fit s my Manfrotto Heads perfectly. 
23129 2 Background is very thin, so keep that in mind. 
23130 4 Nice and durable 
23131 4 Works perfectly. Great picture transmission. Simple setup. I ve ordered 2 more for other rooms. 
23132 4 This is a great product. It is small compact easy for travel. The company TrioSports USA is a wonderful company to do business with. Excellent product and customer service I would recommend this product to my friends. Thank you 
23133 4 Great for the Microscope and great for science kids! 
23134 4 It came on time only 10 days love my pics😄 
23135 4 Great camera, now if I can learn all its finer points! Turns out it s the same one my grandsons bought after extensive research, so it must be good! 
23136 4 Easy setup, quite versitile. Using it to make photos of old family pictures. 
23137 4 I like it and am enjoying it for the purpose I bought this for... I ll be back for more, it works amazingly well! 
23138 2 Should have read the specs closer. Only takes high resolution pics. Cannot change setting for smaller file sizes. Crazy in the day and age that this feature is not included. I have a 15 year old Sony that does it. Otherwise it s a decent camera. 
23139 4 This is in use everyday. I put it in my garage because I normally leave the overhead door open. Now I know when a person enters the garage from in the house. 
23140 4 I bought this for my daughter s 16th birthday and she loves it. It is a great starter camera for the serious young photographer, or anyone starting out for that matter. All the items in this particular package are of good quality, and the Canon products are excellent. 
23141 2 ehhhh, it s great and has great promise, but ultimately the colors are dull and the user experience leaves a lot to be desired. 
23142 4 Perfect!!! 
23143 4 Great case. Just what I expected. The insert holds everything perfectly. 
23144 4 Exactly the battery I was looking for. Product was shipped and at my house in 2 days. Very pleased. 
23145 3 Love the size & color. But, it can t hold an additional lens. Only one... 
23146 1 Very unstable. 
23147 0 The glasses became loose on the third day... I assume that means the filter is not functioning properly. 
23148 3 Great, but not perfect. 
23149 3 Works great! Good Quality! Would definitely recommend! 
23150 2 Decent picture. WAY over priced for a Chinese camera. Software is confusing if you have little experience. Night vision is good to about 30ft. Does not come with SD card. 
23151 4 It s a well thought out design and very snug on my Manfrotto sticks. Nobs are big and look like they aren t likely to break easily. We ll see about that. In any case, I think this one will last. 
23152 4 a necessity for use with cokin filters without having extra equipment 
23153 4 Love it! 
23154 4 Great backpack for DJI. Love it. 
23155 2 Good quality but can t use the protective lens cover on it. 
23156 4 very good for my a6000 setup 
23157 4 Have had 2 of these for about 4 months now, and they have never pulled up an error message on my D3300 or my D5300, have worked great, last just as long or longer than my En-El 14a. Will be buying more. Thankyou guys so much!! 
23158 4 Amazing shipping time. Got it within 3 days if the order. Was exactly what was pictured, well packaged. It is the 70d w. Had the wifi. Just awesome. Better quality accessories than I was even expecting. Thank you. 
23159 4 After using this cloth, my computer screen looks just like new-- it is crystal clear! 
23160 4 love these 
23161 4 very compact and very cushioned for travel. i have Nikon D7000 camera. the case is perfect. all my accessories fit very comfortably. very happy with this purchase 
23162 2 If you want to read my full review with some photos, I posted it on my blog: https://petecocophotography.wordpress.com/2015/08/31/neewer-vertical-grip-for-canon-6d/ 
23163 4 It working like Nikon Battery 
23164 4 Just what I expected 
23165 4 These stands were as described. 
23166 3 Cheap construction hence the price but adequately held my Nikon D5200 and Canon Vixia with no fuss. 
23167 3 The lens caps work great! My only complaint is that the adhesive on the strap didn t work for too long, but otherwise these work great. 
23168 4 There only need me open the APP and scan, no need the cable, it`s so easy for me 
23169 4 A part with a tripod hole is an excellent addition. 
23170 4 Very happy with the battery and the seller 
23171 1 Video quality very poor. See for yourself before making purchase decision. https://app.box.com/s/nxk36fuhqdkcyn1x3iugq1hklo0rzu3d Recorded at 720p 60fps A family member purchased 1 for me and I was about to place order for another one for bicycle but after viewing few recorded video, due to poor video quality, will be returning it. 
23172 0 Took it on an overseas trip of several weeks. When I went to use it it would not work. 
23173 4 Nice one for the price 
23174 4 Great protection. Bit bulky though... 
23175 0 Item works well but it took much longer to receive I paid for faster shipping and it was a Strain on my business because item took much longer 
23176 0 The product came broken and it hás locked into my lens. I have sent my lens to technical assistance to fix. Horrible. Don t buy! 
23177 4 I use this for my Canon T3 and it works very well and charges in the original charger that came with the camera. I love it. 
23178 0 I will not buy again, once clipped requires a screwdriver to unclip it from the camera 
23179 0 Picture quality was ok but the sound was no good at all, I sent it back and would never buy the item ever again Junk. 
23180 4 Second frame I have owned--seamless setup and great picture quality. 
23181 4 As expected still experimenting with this lens forbid is totally new for me. 
23182 4 Sturdy Case, fit s my Hero 4 silver. I m happy with it. 
23183 4 This was a good surprise 🎁. The camera 📷 was ready to shoot right after taking it out of the box. Easy to operate, and the pictures are clear and sharp. Anazing product. 
23184 4 This a good battery replacement than paying a crazy amount for the official canon battery. 
23185 4 Great all around package has everything you need and then some, great product 
23186 4 Exactly as I expected it to be. Works great. Thank you. 
23187 4 I was giving the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest opinion. Great product at a great price. Easy to setup and use. Very sturdy and easy to extend. Highly recommended! 
23188 1 NOT TOO HAPPY.. very complicated to install, not people friendly... I wont recommend this. 
23189 0 Did not work on arrival. Seller refunded money. 
23190 3 as described fast shipping highly recommend 
23191 4 very nice little camera for FPV flying a quadcopter... good clear picture and nice field of view. small and light 
23192 4 Amazing 
23193 4 For the price this bag is great. Love the security for travel. 
23194 4 Always like to have a reserve battery for my camera. This is proving to be very reliable. 
23195 4 This was so easy to install and has been so fun to use (though we seriously installed it as a security measure). Love it--and will probably buy a second one. 
23196 4 gopro is very handy. Beware that you do NOT get the micro SD chip with it and you will need to charge it before using it. 
23197 3 Works as expected Nikon D5200; this is IR not wireless and needs a line of sight. 
23198 4 Use them often, would buy many more. 
23199 1 Seemed good at first until the plastic broke. Can t find replacement parts. 
23200 0 Doesn t even compare to my Olympus - THIS CAMERA IS TOTAL CRAP. The interface is almost the same and I figured that I d give it a shot for $129. GARBAGE. Not waterproof. I repeat - NOT WATERPROOF. Terrible pics. I ll be requesting a refund. 
23201 4 Work 
23202 4 Great accessories 
23203 2 It ll tide me over for a while, but it s soft plastic and is very loose on the lens. Slightest bump and it falls off. 
23204 3 Works perfectly, just a little expensive. 
23205 4 It great to have spare batteries and it charges them quickly. I love having the car adapter. 
23206 4 Excellent product for the price ... and w/ spare batteries. Did the job for me. 
23207 4 Works great! 
23208 4 Just what I was looking for! 
23209 2 Batteries are a tight fit, but all in all, a good product!!! 
23210 4 Works as advertised. 
23211 0 Didn t fit my iPhone 5c right 
23212 3 I have received the product and with no problem. It is always good to have a warranty for expensive items. 
23213 4 Just as expected, nice quality for cleaning glasses. Didn t need individually wrapped, but its a great idea to keep them clean. 
23214 3 A good flash, energizer doesn t make camera flashs, another brand. The listing said this would work with my sony a58 dlsr. It doesn t fit the mount. Had to buy an adapter. Works fine now. As good a flash as those costing twice as much. 
23215 4 Very good attachment to have 
23216 4 I love it. 
23217 4 So perfect for the GoPro!! The clear case is Great!! It is working wonderful and with the mic 100% a most get if you want to do more with it 
23218 2 Not bad. All filters work except the 10x. Decent for price. Good for beginners wanting to learn a little. 
23219 4 Exactly what I needed. 
23220 2 It s usable, but the price is too high for a simple plate like this, especially I already bought two Dolica tripods. 
23221 4 Absolutely love it❤️ 
23222 4 This has proven to be an essential element in my pocket at all times while photographing. Tee cleaner part (not brush) works extremely well and conveniently. 
23223 2 It s ok. Smaller than I hoped for but it does the job 
23224 3 Works great 
23225 4 Nice filters 
23226 4 Was super easy to install and readjust. Is resistant to fingerprints, eye smudges, and protects the glass. Very worthwhile getting. 
23227 0 Terrible! This turns on the GoPro and makes it cycle through menus, takes pictures, etc. It is way too tight and doesn t fit right, caused my battery to die and my gopro to take hundreds of photos. Can t not recommend enough. 
23228 4 My frame quit functioning within 6 months, however the manufacturer has contacted me to offer a replacement. I will update my review when it is received, but I am very impressed by the customer service at this point. 
23229 4 Great 
23230 4 Excellent 3rd person in case something happens. 
23231 4 I already needed 
23232 0 Doesn t stay on very long even with a full charge. Kind of crappy, not nearly as close as it it was going to going to be 
23233 2 Returned them.....really is not way to attach to the sling because its a closed unit...you can not slide these on. I called the company and wondered what the purpose was....because the sling WAS a closed unit 
23234 4 Henry from Support was knowledgeable, patient and very helpful. The camera is very technical and requires too much maintenance for those who are not IT-inclined. 
23235 4 Works just as well as the official GoPro chestmount. Adjustable straps; Fits adults perfectly. 
23236 4 perfect replacement and on time. 
23237 3 Love this thing! My only wish is that the padded shoulder part covered a bit moreFor more padding, and that the adjustment buckle was in the front for quicker adjustments. 
23238 4 Was using the neck strap that came with my Fuji XE-1 and it was so bulky. Changed over to this wonderfully crafted little wrist strap and am a happy camper. I got the camera because it is small and light. The strap conforms and enhances those qualities. 
23239 4 Excellent cloths. Individually wrapped 
23240 1 Only has a hdmi out put dosent have the bnc out, or the rca out 
23241 4 A gift for my daughter ! It looks more expensive than it is .and she loves it!! 
23242 4 Works well for using a one or two sets of filters to cover the from element of your lens. 
23243 4 Great deal 
23244 3 Great!!! 
23245 4 Great 
23246 4 Very sturdy plate. I m using it on a flycam nano to make it easier to remove my Canon 70D. Works great. 
23247 4 I ve been using these batteries in a VIXIA HF R600, and they are performing perfectly. The camera displays the remaining battery life, exactly like the Canon battery. The charger works with these batteries and the original Canon battery. 
23248 4 Great 
23249 4 Always good product from STK. 
23250 4 Very helpful. Calvin was able to help me with my problem very easily. 
23251 4 Good picture quality for the price 
23252 3 Works great, fast charging 
23253 4 put it on my o ring for my water housing of my Sony action Cam and worked great! No leaks and kept the ring nice and lubed! 
23254 3 So far the batteries have performed as expected. Battery life is good. I haven t time it to determine how long it last. 
23255 4 Good quality for the price. 
23256 4 Just what I needed for a spider man car. 
23257 4 NO IDEA HOW MUCH MORE I CAN URGE ANYONE TO BUY THIS. Digital and cell phone images are great, but this!!! Is a must!!! 
23258 3 Cannot be used with a Sony genuine hard lens protector, which I didn t know before. 
23259 4 This is very comfortable to use especially when using a long telephoto lens while hiking. 
23260 4 Nice 
23261 4 excellent product. does what it says. 
23262 1 Maybe I need to go trough some learning but the pictures have odd colors and are blurry. 
23263 4 Product was exactly as described and at a great price and very fast delivery !!! Will be back to this sellers page !!! 
23264 4 This is a great LCD protector, and the only type (GGS) that I would even consider for my camera s. 
23265 4 Great photos 
23266 4 It s nice having extra batteries and the car charger. 
23267 0 Not as Advertised Wrong Item&#62;sent it back. 
23268 4 Excellent first timer s camera, great quality, video, and accessories are a nice added touch. The price deal was great too! I like it a lot! 
23269 3 Really happy with this accessory. I really like that as well as a pistol grip, it can be used as a small tripod. It has helped keeping my shots steady as opposed to using the handle on a traditional handy cam. 
23270 4 Works great. Could have made the knock out holes easier to punch out. 
23271 4 Fits camera well in both directions. Costs a little more but it works! 
23272 4 If you give a good description you ll always have a satisfied customer. 
23273 4 they are all useful product with reasonable price. 
23274 3 Fine so far. 
23275 4 These do an awesome job of cleaning!!! 
23276 4 Perfect. On time. 5/5 
23277 4 This camera mount works excellent for my bicycle. It is a very simple design, but sometime the simplest designs are the best, which is the case with this product. It attaches securely on my handlebars. Once secure it stays that way. My camera takes excellent pictures/video as I ride. 
23278 4 The quality is very good for the price. The ball is smooth, hardware are build to high quality. It is quite big and heavy, not a travel ball head. For stationary use, it is perfect. 
23279 4 It was nice A+ in my book 
23280 3 nice easy to use takes great photos 
23281 4 Great and handy ....easy to setup 
23282 0 ZERO STARS, this P.O.S. came with users guide written by some one with no working use of English and it never worked after we worked out the coded messages it came with. the old saying is true : you get what you pay for. 
23283 0 Terrible. Used one piece and it broke putting it on. The suction cup dose not work at all. 
23284 1 the straps don t handle the weight of all the glass and the camera. I am frequently adjusting the straps. the front pocket is awkward. 
23285 4 Worked as advertised 
23286 4 Nicely constructed and great fit for GX7 camera. I am quite happy with this purchase. 
23287 4 Really helpful to keep your gopro safe on your boards, bikes, and even wrists. Definitely recommend if you do not want to lose your gopro. 
23288 4 Very well made, it s comfortable and durable. It feels more secure in your hand than any handle. 
23289 4 Excellent product works as expected. 
23290 4 awesome. these batteries are great, came in quick, charged up pretty quickly and lasted for longer than they should on a charge. 
23291 4 Love it!!!! Excellent zoom! Going to take it on my cery first cruise with my girlfriend. I plan on taking some pictures and videos. 
23292 4 Wonderful lens 
23293 4 okey 
23294 1 This says that it will fit Sony Alpha cameras, but it did not fit my Alpha A6000. Not sure who gets the credit for the description, whether it s the manufacturer or Amazon. Big caveat emptor. I returned it of course, and have to look for another product. 
23295 3 Not bad, for more effect I added some wires 
23296 4 Works exactly as expected! 
23297 4 My daughter loves this camera fun for teens but pictures are pretty expensive about $1.00 each. 
23298 4 every thing ok 
23299 4 IT WAS BETTER THAN I EXPECTED!! PRICING WAS EXCELLENT 
23300 3 Great! 
23301 4 Excellent product. Thanks! 
23302 4 Great cam for recreation use. YES...It is Water Proof. We submerged it for 5 minutes or more and we continue to enjoy the benefits of this camera. Little heavy but durable. SPLASH 
23303 4 Used this case while white water rafting. I was able to fit two DSLR cameras into it and they remained dry and protected. Able to stand on the case too without impacting its contents. 
23304 2 I thought it was bigger but it works well with accessories. 
23305 0 These cameras are junk. Extremely poor video if you can get them to work at all. 
23306 4 Work well 
23307 4 This product met my expectations. 
23308 4 Kenneth was very helpful and figured out the problem. Everything working now. Foscam is a nice camera. It s great to be able to check on things when we are not at home. Thanks for the great service. 
23309 4 I bought this as a spare. I use it with my Sony A72 and it works well. Great price and I recommend it highly 
23310 4 Pretty decent product but a little tricky to install. Overall, I m fairly satisfied that it will protect that fragile screen on my G16. 
23311 4 Works perfectly fine in my E-M1. 
23312 0 The battery is broken 
23313 4 Great high quality product at a good price. From a company that stands behind thier product and are aiming for not just the highest of quality product, but top knotch customer service for any of your needs! Highly recommend this ND filter lack of color/ image distortion is suburb. 
23314 4 Fits perfect 
23315 4 Easy set up. We needed a barn camera to monitor our animals. The barn was well within our router range and this worked well for our needs. 
23316 4 Very pleased 
23317 3 Had some problems with recording button, sent it back to replay to fix and they changed it for a new one, working perfectly! Sellers experience was quite good and I can only recommend them. 
23318 4 Wish it had instructions 
23319 4 Recommend 
23320 4 Really great tripod. Stable and quick to setup. I have used this at weddings, events, portraits and filming. 
23321 4 Excelent product 
23322 0 filters - are ok but - the wipes had a cloud of dust on them 
23323 4 Love the product. Very easy to set up. Pictures are very clear. If putting outside I would suggest buying the adjustable mounts. 
23324 4 Quality of this tripod is excellent compared to my old one. Easy to use & transport. Really nice flexible piece of equipment for shooting from various angles. 
23325 4 nice 
23326 0 it s not working as expected it would work and I can t return it anymore 
23327 4 love this lens for landscape and astro photography. 
23328 4 When using a timer just won t cut it - remote control! 
23329 4 Awesome, thank you so much looks amazing! 
23330 4 Nice cable, armored from sharp edges. 
23331 4 Everything about this camera is great! Size and weight is so much better than my old camera. Fits easily in my pocket for on-the-go use. Mine was refurbished, but it looks new. Not a single problem with it so far. 
23332 4 Worked out great. 
23333 4 Easy to use. Practical size. Nick 
23334 4 I like the black over the silver. The bayonet action is smooth. 
23335 3 Good 
23336 0 Did not fit, did not respond to my inquiry. 
23337 4 Fit my Canon 28-135 IS just like the Canon version, makes me regret buying these overpriced Canon branded ones for all these years. 
23338 4 Thank you 
23339 4 Nice compact size for a good price. 
23340 4 Expensive but works and worth it! 
23341 4 Was worth the purchase it s very easy to use 
23342 4 Great! 
23343 3 I was disappointed that it doesn t come with a full instructional guide.I had to play with it to figure what most of the buttons do. 
23344 4 Fits perfect to the Coolpix AW130 Great stuff! 
23345 3 worked well enough for my purposes so far. I still have some more experimentation to do before I can give it my full approval 
23346 3 Easy to set up and excellent support available. First one was a breeze, second one ran into a small issue but Ed from customer support walked me through it easily! Would recommend and will purchase more dlink products in the future. 
23347 2 Regular 
23348 4 Good charger for my IS-200X sONY 
23349 2 This is a perfectly acceptable inexpensive camera bag. It s just not great. I am storing my 1950 s Voghtlander in it so OK for that since it sits in my closet most of the time. 
23350 4 Works well easy to use 
23351 3 It fits the Nikon P7800 perfectly. Not much room for anything else 
23352 4 Works very good.. Pic s are great. Not at nite... 
23353 4 great works love it , great price 
23354 4 Worth it for the price. The tripod is not that sturdy but you ll get use to it. 
23355 4 Soft rubber means good protecting, easy to pack and carry, and it s lightweight. 
23356 4 Really nice set. Has all you need for the camera. Seems to be well made. 
23357 1 Night vision works great still not hd but the regular video is so bad when played on a regular sized monitor its super grainy... didnt like this camera at all 
23358 0 Terrible..just terrible... I bought three camera s and could not even get one to hook up to the WiFi. Even the tech support (unfortunately one over worked person in California) could not even fix. Sending back. 
23359 0 unit was bad / ok day light but not at night / ir was bad (oversaturated). sent it back. 
23360 4 Although I had a cleaning set, I didn t have anything like this one. I gave my DSLR and good cleaning after I cleaned the CMOS. Now I use this set as my first cleaning attack before each major usage and am really happy, 
23361 1 The case the lenses comes in broke immediately upon opening it. 
23362 4 Just adding my five stars to the rest of the reviewers, the ring s threads are fine and attach to the camera and filter smoothly. The price is fair and the cloth is an added plus. 
23363 4 Got the product on time. Loved it, it took very good pictures and was very happy. Thanks 
23364 3 I bought this case for my boyfriend to use for his SJCAM. The SJCAM and his accessories all fit nicely in it. I was drawn to this case because it was one of the few I found that was big enough to accommodate his suction cup. 
23365 4 The item works great. Thank you. 
23366 4 Great product and price. Fast shipping! 
23367 3 Does what I need. Nice design and accessories. Glad I got it. 
23368 4 More than I expected for the money. Great deal and more gadgets than I could ever use. 
23369 4 Worked just as advertised. It better 
23370 2 Pretty cool stick, but beware, the clip that holds the remote is a little wonky-- I bumped it and the clip and my remote dropped to the bottom of the lake-- reinforcing it w duct tape would ve probably been the thing to do. 
23371 3 It work as intended, the price is good, waiting to see how long the battery last. 
23372 4 Handy! 
23373 4 Worked perfectly, including the couple of times I needed both hands and wanted to let the camera just bob on the surface. 
23374 3 Its very easy to scratch and it give blue tones to long exposure images- can be easily fix in lightroom, still trying to figure out white balance for different filters. 
23375 4 Have not used it yet but it looks nice 
23376 0 Doesn t fit the hero 2. Is there another piece I need? 
23377 4 I was learing about buying one of these on amazon, but it was a nice pleasant surprise! It worked absolutely wonderuland the quality is great, especially for the price! 
23378 4 Great 
23379 4 Excellent product and arrived on time. 
23380 0 Does not plug directly into the wall. Comes with chord (not pictured) 
23381 2 As promised, the picture keeper was very easy to use. However, the 16000 photo capacity picture keeper only held 6000 pictures, so be smart and buy one that is 3 times what you think you need. 
23382 0 Horrible. Upon attempting to remove it from my flash trigger, the end of the cord snipped off. ULTRA delicate junk. 
23383 2 These vibrating motors are great to make robots and vibrate a lot and effectively. The wires are a little short though (1cm) 
23384 4 Nice. I carry the camera in my purse, great protection. 
23385 3 exactly what I expected. good quality 
23386 4 I love it and recommend this product. 
23387 0 A right disaster. Not only are there no instructions in English, the flash gun stopped working after 2 sessions. It simply stopped coming on. Really disappointing. 
23388 0 Worst product ever! Its all plastic, its weak, the wind doesn t let it spin, even when there where no wind still doesn t spin. None of my timelapses ended up right. Not recommended 
23389 3 Works well but somewhat oversized. Fast delivery. 
23390 2 Doesn t really do high end FD lenses justice. Also could never figure out how to take out the optional element. 
23391 4 works well..no problems so far 
23392 4 Greate equipment, we re using it for a mine site and it gets really dirty and have no issues at all. Previous camera was lost and we had no doubt on getting the same as a replacement. 
23393 4 This bag is very spacious and secure. I travel often for filming projects and so far I m pleased with how this bag protects camera gear and additional items. 
23394 4 Love this bag, very comfortable to wear. Very durable. 
23395 0 I ordered this product, totally excited to get the fabulous DSC WX350 plus accessories for this amazing price. When it arrived, it was NOT the DSC WX350 at all! Instead, it was a DSX W830, a substantially less expensive camera with limited capabilities. 
23396 1 Did not work out sent back still waiting for credit. Should have paid more attention I had to send back to China cost me more in shipping then I was ever willing to pay it is not a good product I would not recommend it does not deserve to stars 
23397 3 Work well last a long time. 
23398 4 Worked great, bought 5 more for friends that I showed 
23399 4 I lost my charger some time ago and couldn t use my palmcorder until now. I was glad to find it. 
23400 0 Received the wrong size batteries. the description suggested this type for the camera, but they were not the right ones. 
23401 4 Love the products from cowboys studio 
23402 4 Good product 
23403 4 These lens caps and cords work as well as original equipment. Price was right. Arrived quickly. 
23404 0 Only able to use once went to use it again the red lights pop up on the back showing I have full battery life but the light doesn t come on anymore. Waste of money guess you get what you pay for ! 
23405 4 These offer a great value and super clear image. I would order these for friends! 
23406 1 Extremely unreliable when connecting over wifi. After two months it stopped connecting to my network at al, wifi or wired. 
23407 4 Just the perfect size for my Coolpix S9700!! 
23408 3 Great item for the price! 
23409 4 As advertised 
23410 3 Great scope. Get your scope level and its on the money locating objects. Doesn t view nebula really well at all. Grey spots in space. 
23411 4 Perfecto 
23412 4 Very satisfied and excellent multi-platform charger. Charges LifePO4. 
23413 2 good deal 
23414 4 Works as advertised; holds battery, looks nice 
23415 4 This works perfectly on my monopod in conjunction with the DP-50 QR Camera Plate.

23428 2 it s an ok point and shoot getting all the extras were good the optical zoom just was not good enough to suit me. I ended up getting a canon SX50 refurbished from canon website for $179

23439 1 Quality isn t what I would expect for a samsung. The casing is cheap plastic and the actual video quality is on the poorer side. I think my samsung phone (note 4) takes better quality video. I was surprised and disappointed. 
23440 4 Great investment and I love it so much And here are some pic that I took for my Sony a6000. 
23441 4 Excellent product, it works perfectly. 
23442 4 Excelent product

23453 4 excellent product, but no information or use recommendations included, would have been nice. Well made. Quick delivery, no issues. Did not need to contact company, used Go Pro, as described. No complaints. instructions. 
23454 4 Best baby monitor/security cam on the market. I sent the others brands back after seeing how easy to use and powerful the nest was. We ll be buying more for each room in the house. 
23455 0 Don t waste your money on this one. Parts falling off as I pulled it out of the box. Pieces cracked as I tried to put together. Didn t hold reflector. Total garbage. 
23456 4 Excellent 
23457 4 Perfect size, great zipper quality and material and has side bag for equipment. My carbide tripod for telephoto lens fits perfectly. 
23458 0 This was poorly and cheaply made. Don t waste your time or money. Big disappointment. Better to hide the camera among some books. I returned it at once. EW 
23459 4 Great product 
23460 4 Very good! 
23461 4 Works great. I already have it hooked up to my body board. Got some dope footy. 
23462 4 Smells like bad rubber for a while. But does the job fine 
23463 4 Great add-on camera, this is actually replacing one that failed to work upon installing. 
23464 4 as shown 
23465 4 Once you get the hang of it, it s easy to use and an overall awesome product. 
23466 4 Good, inexpensive! 
23467 4 Excellent buy!! 
23468 3 Great price 
23469 4 Excellent product. Excellent company. The BX-2 gives my gear extra protection and I feel confident nothing short of an elephant sitting on any of by BX-2 gear will cause any damage. I am extremely happy and highly recommend this product and the Brenthaven. 
23470 4 I purchased a a back up battery for my camera. This battery holds a charge, for a long time. 
23471 4 love it. 
23472 4 It is ok to make home pictures 
23473 4 Almost cant look at the moon without it. Works great! 
23474 4 Best full frame ever!! Nikon has done it again!! 
23475 4 good 
23476 3 Fit my SJ4000 good a snug. On mine though one of the legs for the clamping area was bent badly and barely works. But it does work. 
23477 4 I don t see any play, a good product for the price 
23478 0 bad product 
23479 4 Very nice kit! Planning on using it on vacation out west. I love Canon products and so far so good. 
23480 4 Still working in my Olypus. 
23481 4 Fantastic FPV camera. So much better than using a Mobius for FPV. 
23482 1 Not an east fit! 
23483 4 does exactly what it needs to do... i little scary to try it, but it really works 
23484 4 Thank you 
23485 2 difficulty using. My fingers are too big!! 
23486 4 ok 
23487 2 weird little robotic guy I guess it works great for scaring people 
23488 4 Great product 
23489 4 Good quality pictures, compact design, and easy to use. 
23490 4 The best action cam. None compare. 
23491 4 I bought h t these for a trip. They are an excellent buy and I have confidence in this brand. 
23492 4 I have received it well. 
23493 3 It works just as I expected for the price I paid. I love that I can take photos that don t look as selfies... 
23494 3 My son likes it a lot. 
23495 4 Just what I needed for my new SX60 and a spare battery 
23496 4 This worked really well - comfy and easy to locate! 
23497 2 It works but did not come with a memory card 
23498 4 Great value, wish that camera was more wide angle. 
23499 2 letters of &#34;celestron&#34; logo are cheap stickers, and got lost rapidly 
23500 1 More difficult to collapse in comparison to other brands. 
23501 2 Very cheap casing but it will do the job. 
23502 4 So cute i love it , and some people say it has a nasty smell but really imine doesnt smell funky So happy my birthday is saturday now i have a baggie to wear with my outfit to carry my camera 
23503 4 Best money I have spent. Love this product 
23504 4 Very nice lens, tack-sharp 
23505 4 Great product 
23506 4 Sweet produce. Better than expected build quality and fit. 
23507 2 Works well easy quick app install and remote view. Haven t done the port forwarding yet. Although major issue with speaker and mic very close on camera you get a lot of echo and feedback 
23508 0 Put in a new micro card, can t get product to work at this time. Been trouble shooting for a week now and I ve tried everything (yes, including the reset button.) Don t see any way to reach out to the company for customer service. Wishful thinking I know. 
23509 2 The title says this item has two hot shoes. Not so! A &#34;hot&#34; shoe is electrically connected to the camera, which controls the flash triggering. This item merely holds the flash in a bracket. It s up to you to connect it to the camera somehow. 
23510 4 I highly recommend Celestron lenses in general and this kit is tops and worth it when purchased with the scope. 
23511 4 This is one of my favorite purchases I ve made in a while. The quality is great and fits my 30 pound dog perfectly. Get ready for some of the most hilarious GoPro video you will ever shoot. 
23512 4 Bought it for my Mom. It s her first digital camera, and she was a reluctant convert from film. She loves it. 
23513 0 This is a terrible case. Do not buy this product! I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased it. My camera was ruined in only 35 feet of water. 
23514 4 wrong lens 
23515 4 Great product! 
23516 4 Super fast delivery. Great value. Very good product. 
23517 2 If the pockets were a bit deeper and a bit tighter to prevent the memory SD and Micro SD cards from coming loose in the case I would have given it a five star rating. 
23518 3 Good quality and great price. 
23519 4 As described. Good value. 
23520 4 The best camera I have bought so far. In great condition and delivery was fast. Thanks. 
23521 3 decent case 
23522 4 It does what it s supposed to do. It works great 
23523 4 Exactly what I needed. Exactly what was advertised. Very high quality. 
23524 4 The device works the same as the 4 port system, With a few additional settings and options. Had it setup and running in less than 10 minutes. 
23525 4 Works as advertised. Will allow having filters mounted. 
23526 4 Bought as a gift for my son. He loves it -- fit perfectly. 
23527 4 love it! 
23528 0 will not hold a charge. do not buy 
23529 4 Unbelievable photo backpack. Took it to Europe for two weeks and it was so easy to carry my Canon 70D with 18-135 and 24-70 lenses. Lightweight and sturdy. Best camera bag for traveling. 
23530 0 I would not recommend it I do not like it 
23531 4 Excellent camera rolling backpack, it is everything I expected, liads of room for camera bodies and various lenses. 
23532 0 I got this camera and it got stuck trying to turn on, I got a replacement and it also won t even power up. 
23533 4 Does exactly what it s supposed to do at half the price of Manfrotto s version. 
23534 4 Perfect, exactly as described. 
23535 3 I got this tripod and it fell apart but the customer service reps were responsive to my needs and sent me one that is very study and awesome. Thanks guys! 
23536 3 Great point and shoot with some more customizable options. Large to fit in a pocket 
23537 4 Two excellent working batteries for a Very reasonable price. \m/ 
23538 1 I have a Sony HX9V. It says it´s good for the camera, but I´m afraid it will break my lens. When turned on, it fits to tight, and the case pushes the lens to it´s sides. 
23539 4 they worked well 
23540 4 Very good product,best you can get for an instant camera! 
23541 4 It s my personal &#34;photography assistant&#34; that holds the reflectors, and the flowers, too. 
23542 4 All metal, well made. It does not think down too small though. 
23543 4 Easy to install. Does what it should. Delivered new, in perfect condition and on time. Priced right. 
23544 0 This is incredibly flimsy, with weak clips that hold the hood on the lens. I honestly can t figure out why people are writing positive reviews for this item. 
23545 4 great camera 
23546 4 Well made and as compact as can be for a mirror less camera. Fits my NX500 with kit lens and flash as well as two batteries in the pocket. Much nicer than carrying a bag everywhere and worrying about putting the bag down 
23547 0 I returned this product. It did not fit my Sony NEX-5T as advertised. 
23548 3 Haven t used it yet but came as advertised and fits fine. 
23549 4 Fits my Canon S120 perfectly. Zips up both side making quick and easy to remove. Sturdy build. 
23550 4 Product as described, and function at least as well as Sony batteries. I haven t measured the capacity claims, but they do seem plausible. 
23551 4 This is the coolest camera. Takes pictures with easy and a clear shot. New to it but it has a lot of features I have to try yet.\JIM 
23552 4 Great camera 
23553 4 great item. I have not been disappointed by any of the Vortex optics and here again they did great. It is a bit heavy, but compared to binos this are way lighter unless money is no object. 
23554 4 Great item for a great price! and awesome service from eco-Fused to boot! Will definitely buy again! 
23555 3 good 
23556 4 Works great no complaints. 
23557 4 Best bang for the buck speedlight. Sync @ 1/8000! Rivals if not surpasses other pro models priced more than double of this. Plus it is a master flash to control other speedlights. 
23558 4 awtnu47533tutrerytutreyu nyteyrste5y 
23559 4 Worth the $$ as an alternate to Macro lens.. 
23560 0 Doze not respond well on the PTZ controls. Long delay. Keeps show up ofg line in my dlink. I try two different units and both have the same problems 
23561 4 Let s you control multiple GoPro cameras remotely. Great for controlling that camera on your head, selfie stick, tripod or other equipment. 
23562 4 I really like it 
23563 1 It is better than nothing. 
23564 4 Does the job. 
23565 4 Thank you Very much 
23566 4 Great camera, I have purchased 3 of these already to record our Church services. They are great in low light and have a quality image. 
23567 2 The DVR needs to be reset after a week of two. Eventually replaced the dvr 
23568 4 Nice, cheap, and works well. 
23569 3 great camera, has very nice video quality, very compact. easy to do vlogs and whatever else. 
23570 3 Short version: There are some definite quality control issues with this product, but on the whole it does what it says on the tin at an unbeatable price. Definitely a buy if you have Prime and so can return your first one if that particular unit is of poor quality. 
23571 4 This camera is really an awesome camera for the money. Yes it is mirror less but still works very very well. I am extremely satisfied with it. 
23572 4 its pretty good but smaller than expected I thought i was getting a larger bag than I already have to hold all my stuff , this bag barely fits nikon d7000 
23573 0 The pen will not take a charge and cannot be recognized by the computer. When i press the record button, it stops in 5 to 7 seconds. 
23574 3 Excellent productos, very responsable the seller upon delivery recommend 
23575 4 These work great and last longer then the one that came with the Camera. 
23576 4 My second GoPro remote and it s better than my first one (GoPro 3). This one works well with my GoPro Silver and also works well within the App. Comes with a wrist strap unlike my first remote! 
23577 4 Amazing lens good deal 
23578 0 I had this battery overnighted to me to record my sons 9th birthday. It wouldn t take a charge. Very disappointing and very bad business. Get your S#%T together or close the doors!! 
23579 4 Just one word.......awesome! 
23580 3 Good stand. 
23581 4 Good fit:) 
23582 4 I really like my Canon battery grip. It does a great job. 
23583 4 We purchased this as a gift and it was perfect! My husband loaded a memory card to make it easy for the recipient. It is a smaller frame which makes it easy to transfer to any room you like. Affordable and it was well received by the recipient. 
23584 0 don t work camera. Please if you change this one. 
23585 4 Very nice item, Exactly what I expected to receive. 
23586 4 Works perfect with my 1D Mark IV, charges quick, hols a charge and is recognized by my camera. This is a perfect replacement for the OEM battery. I just purchased a spare battery for a fraction of the cost of a Canon battery.. 
23587 4 I used this on my new sony a7rm2, a great way to protect LCD from scratches. 
23588 4 Its a snug fit which is reassuring however the access panel is not accessible unless it is take off prior to placing the camera in the mount but as I m typing this I m realizing its an intentional design and I ll change this to 5 stars. 
23589 3 Getting amazing full zoom shots! The mega OIS got me hand held shots at full zoom that I would have needed a trip-pod for previously. Appreciated the lens accessories that came with it. Taking it with me to Yellowstone & Grand Teton NP s next week! 
23590 4 My first purchase on amazon and very very happy with it. I am an amateur photographer. The photos attached were taken with the 36mm extension tube on my sony a58... 
23591 4 good 
23592 4 I love this lens! Great quality/value. 
23593 4 Great camera. Excellent condition. Everything arrived as expected. 
23594 4 Great camera. Can t beat for waterproof shooting. 
23595 3 Not a bad deal for a starter. 
23596 4 Purchased this camera for my husband. He loves it. 
23597 4 Works great, easy to install, had a previous D-Link which was very erratic and difficult to install. I returned the D-Link. 
23598 0 TERRIBLE. Two of these snapped and flew apart within two hours of clamping a backdrop to a stand. Almost injured crew. Do not buy. Potentially dangerous. 
23599 4 We like our first NIX digital frame so well that we purchased a second. This model has a 15&#34; screen versus our previous 12&#34;, making it easier to see photo details from across the room. Easy to setup, great image clarity, Very pleased with the frame. 
23600 0 Strap BROKE with my Panasonic Lumix FZ1000 on it,after only a few weeks.I’d give it a negative 10 star rating if possible. 
23601 4 Great!! 
23602 4 I have two CAMERAS not working i need to send back. I have 6 cameae install and they are work find 
23603 0 Not excellent 
23604 0 it broke within 3 weeks.... 
23605 4 great 
23606 4 Fits in a bag, easy to store or carry, perfect for large cameras with zoom lenses or flash attachments. Works on anything flat, take Maine every where, fits in the bottom of my camera bag 
23607 4 Bought it for my husband, he loves it!!! 
23608 0 This camera is a point and shoot that tries really hard to be more than that. Too many options. In addition, the battery life is super short. I would not recommend this camera. Buy a SLR digital or a cheaper point and shoot. Not worth the extra $$. 
23609 2 not as good as i expected should have got the 70-300mm 
23610 2 Decent stick not too stiff at full extention but good for the price. You wont be jumping off cliffs with this guy but i m sure i will have uses for it 
23611 0 This does not work at all with the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 I bought at the same time. I want to return it. 
23612 4 easy to install and great picture. 
23613 2 Worked good but needed some info on controls and no Customer support available! 
23614 4 So much brighter pictures inoors 
23615 4 It has a good handle and the tip is sturdy but gentle enough 
23616 3 Fast delivery. Use it once and works. 
23617 1 I needed these canisters for an experiment in my class, and a lot of the lids didn t snap on tightly. 
23618 4 Works great! This was originally a gag gift for my husband s birthday, but he really likes it. 
23619 3 Works just like advertised. Cannot expect more. 
23620 4 came with bundle don t use head strap 
23621 4 amazing, arrived within a couple of day,s 
23622 4 great product 
23623 4 Wow! This light is very bright and exactly what I was looking for! I was trying to get a very specific light style for products and people shots and this light was perfect. 
23624 3 good value,too bad the camera is broken, but it did charge the battery... 
23625 4 I received mine in the time that said it would arrive. Very happy with my new drone. Great power. 
23626 0 Product was broken, the phone holder to be exact. Managed to glue it my self. I guess you get what you pay for. 
23627 4 Fast and reliable. Overnight shipping a success! 
23628 4 Great! 
23629 0 This pan, in my opinion, was very poorly constructed - it broke on me after two hours of use. On the bright side, my ability to understand Chinese translated to English is getting much better. :-) 
23630 4 This is really really good and I recommend it. However, I am 66 inches tall, and this is only 50 inches tall. 
23631 4 Love it 
23632 4 Easy to set up and it works perfectly 
23633 4 Work great. 
23634 4 Cheap and totally does the job 
23635 3 Fairly easy to install. Seems like a fair price for this good product 
23636 4 Everything works fine. Battery capacity is about the same as the original Olympus battery. 
23637 3 It was an excellent item delivered on time and intact. Thank you. 
23638 4 A little too small. 
23639 4 This is a real 808 #16 v3. Arrived in 7 days of purchase. Everything worked as advertised. 
23640 4 Great budget flash with plenty of features and solid construction for the price. 
23641 4 I ordered. They sent promptly. Product good. I am happy. 
23642 4 Such an awesome camera love it 
23643 2 No instructions included 
23644 4 It was exactly what I was looking for in this price range. 
23645 4 I love it,, the price was very reasonable the camera works as expected,, picture is clear and I do not have any complaint 
23646 4 This is a super easy to use digital frame. I love the video option. I previously had a Kodak pulse frame and loved it, but this one is equally as good and a much larger size! 
23647 4 Had no idea GoPros were even bordering on affordable. Between the camera itself, the items that come in the starter pack, and even GoPro s own FREE software you get to edit videos... this thing is simply amazing!! 
23648 3 Love the features of this camera. However, the battery life leaves much to be desired. 
23649 4 My daughter had enjoyed it so much. She was completely satisfied and extatic with the case. 
23650 4 camera takes great photo s, not overly heavy. camera has worked really well for taking photo s as just an enthusiast. 
23651 2 I use these batteries in a Nikon 1 V3. The battery life is degrading significantly with each use. If you have a Nikon battery, these are good back-up batteries. I would not use one of these batteries as your main camera battery. 
23652 4 Great batteries, exceeded my expectations... 
23653 4 great invention 
23654 4 Just as described..works well with a steady hand. Does not feel cheaply made. 
23655 2 good basic point and shoot camera. in some lightings, the pictures get an odd orange glow. if the light does not work well, i just switch to black and white and that fixes the problem. zoom works well. over all, i am very happy with this camera 
23656 4 Five out of five stars 
23657 3 It s ok for it s price easy to use 
23658 4 Sony recommended website product for a6000. Fits and protects hot shoe. 
23659 4 I use this mini tripod all the time. It holds my webcam and my cameras. This is the perfect size for small spaces. 
23660 4 Package met all expectations. Wifi works great. Good quality pictures. 
23661 2 make static noise but good images. 
23662 4 good replacement for a broken one I had 
23663 4 We are very happy with the product and the excellent service. 
23664 4 Works fine on my Sigma 150-600 S lens. Fits in my two RRS ball heads and clamps. Price is right, no flexing. 
23665 4 Works like a charm! 
23666 4 Very useful when you need a backup battery. I highly recommend! 
23667 4 More shots with the Nikon that with the less-expensive after-market batteries. 
23668 4 good product 
23669 4 Have used it with sunrise and sunset to enhance the color, works fine. 
23670 4 Best camera I ever had. Pictures and movies are crystal clear. Great battery life. Used it on charger to record memorable motorcycle rides in all kinds of weather. Sound is great too. 
23671 4 Loved this product! Was perfect for making personal postcards and was super durable and easy! 
23672 1 Temperature sensors on the unit don t seem to be working right. 
23673 2 ok 
23674 4 Good 
23675 4 the chroma key green screen is a great item. Its working for me and I am having fun with it. Thank you for the great item. 
23676 3 Takes awesome photos 
23677 4 Very easy to install and fits PERFECTLY. 
23678 4 A lot of things I will not use but the price is great. The case does not fit everthing so well but it works. 
23679 4 Great camera for the price. Easy to use and produces quality pictures. 
23680 3 Nice camera, good price but the accessories are very modest 
23681 4 Good for sealife...all tipe 
23682 3 Bought three of these, two worked and connected well, one was a bit tricky and I had to move it closer to the controller to get it to work. A bit pricey for what it is, I am now building my own with mysensors. 
23683 4 Works great, but wish it fit my head. A tad to big big. Would it be to late to send back for my size with measurements? 
23684 4 Work great to clean sunglasses camera ect. Awesome product 
23685 4 Fast shipping and charger works great! Thanks 
23686 0 This camera is cheap , its ok to use 9 years old 
23687 3 Nice camera system 
23688 3 ALL WENT WELL 
23689 4 This rig is just what I was hoping for ... compact ... easy to use and store ... puts me right on the hitch ball with ease. 
23690 4 It s great for webcams or cameras! 
23691 3 Worked fine, the price was good, but too long to get here. As a back up its what I needed would buy again. 
23692 4 Just what my GoPro needed! Strong!!! 
23693 4 Awesome product 
23694 4 Overall The Best Video Camera I Have Used. Amazing 1080p Video Quality 
23695 4 worked. serves its purpose 
23696 2 Really wish this had more area for my extras. I will need a bigger bag, but this does secure my camera well. 
23697 0 One of the plastic clips broke the first time I opened it. 
23698 4 I love it! Lightweight, sturdy, and so easy to set up and change placements. Would recommend! -Canon Rebel T5i user 
23699 3 It was a present for my teen son, he really like it. 
23700 4 Awesome camera Such an improvement over my old t2i. I never realized how much better my pictures could get. Works great in lower light even without a flash. Accessories are a nice add on 
23701 3 Great case!!.... My Canon fit into it nicely....... 
23702 4 I like it very much. It is pretty discrete too. However if you use the two camera feature the video quality drops. 
23703 1 Almost impossible to get on....you have to remove the hood, put it on and then reattach the hood. 
23704 4 Full featured controller for your Canon. 
23705 4 Great Thank you 
23706 4 Used this mount to record videos for my soon-to-be Youtube Channel. 
23707 4 Terrific for a DIY security system. 
23708 2 I should have done a little more research before buying. I found picture hangers that are almost exactly the same for only $2. Otherwise it does okay. 
23709 4 I m really enjoying this scope so far. Very easy to assemble. Saturn and the moon look amazing. If you re new to amateur astronomy and you don t want to spend a lot initially but you want nice optics, you should get this scope! 
23710 4 9/3 update: Used for a week on photo sessions on Appledore Island, ME. The strap was GREAT! Easy to carry camera with this attached (Nikon D5300 with Tamron 18-300). Looking for neck relief on upcoming trip to Italy. 
23711 4 I love this compact camera 
23712 0 Definitely wasn t new like it stated so I returned it and went to my local Best Buy to get a NEW one. Love the camera. 
23713 4 Perfect! 
23714 4 Looks great on my strobes, Works great, Priced great~ 
23715 4 Very nice flash. Works very well on my d3300 Very quick on the recharge between shots 
23716 1 Resolution so poor that it was virtually useless. Horrid video and photo quality. Get the 12mp and save yourself a headache. 
23717 4 Very pleased with this purchase 
23718 4 Arrived on time, so far the functionality of the product works good as described in the mfg spec 
23719 4 Outstanding!!!! They are super clear and bright. Unless you like to throw money out the window, there is NO need to buy the German brands at double the price. These are VERY VERY GOOD. 
23720 2 works well for the picture but finding a way to feed it not so easy finnally taped it to an electrical tape so i could run it in the pipe 
23721 3 Great case. Fits the Nikon Coolpix S9900 camera well. However, it doesn t leave a lot of space for an additional battery and cables. 
23722 0 It was used -- scratches on display and buttons. Clearly previously owned. 
23723 4 ok 
23724 4 Cable came quickly and works great! 
23725 4 Everything you need and more. 
23726 0 Trash !!! Terrible !!! Bad image !!! 
23727 3 Great camera. 
23728 4 This kit is a good all purpose kit and will fit most needs when used with a camera that has the standard screw posts such as the contour. Everything worked as advertised and meets the required needs. I would recommend this. 
23729 4 As Expected 
23730 2 I thought this would be good to hold my thumb drive but the strap is too stiff. 
23731 4 This kit contains all that you ll need. 
23732 3 it s a great little camera. A bit difficult to get the exact settings you want. 
23733 4 Great piece. Fit my non-Nikon MBD-10-Like battery grip as well. Great with the ENEL-4A with the D700 for faster frame rate. 
23734 4 awesome! 
23735 4 Awesome I like how it locks so it won t just keep turning. 
23736 3 Manufacture has delivered as promise on both product and specification. One camera crack; but, was immediately resolved by manufacture. Great service!! Replied all inquires and questions. Keep up the good work!!! 
23737 0 I didn t receive exactly as what shown and described, The dual battery charger replaced with a single battery charger. The wall charger which has 2 usb slots is not included. The usb cable not included. More description about what I received can be shown in the attached photo. 
23738 4 Product received as expected 
23739 4 I was so excited to find this product! I have a Sony NEX-C3 and needed some better lighting for my pictures. I ordered this and the Chromo 216 LED CI-216 light and they paired perfectly together. 
23740 1 too complicated. software glitchy or not working. useless piece of crap. 
23741 4 Fit great 
23742 4 Works great! 
23743 4 Excellent light meter. I use it mostly for landscape and wildlife photography and it dies everything I expected, and more. 
23744 3 Quite easy to use and was a present.... 
23745 4 Sturdy and nice 
23746 0 Do not work 
23747 4 Here is a shot from the camera on my last trip! 
23748 1 its not what i was looking for but it will have to do. :( 
23749 4 very bright LED light, works great when natural light is less then desirable. 
23750 4 work like my oem canon ones in my 5dmkiii. no issues 
23751 0 very poor quality, the picture is not clean, wasted my money !!!!!!!!!!!! 
23752 4 This is a good starter pack of all different accessories for the GoPro. All good condition 
23753 3 As noted in previous reviews, this setup is great for the money. There isn t much for instructions, but enough to puzzle it out, The stands are a bit shaky, so be careful. 
23754 4 Great item, delivered on time. 
23755 4 This makes using the camera outside in bright sun soooo much easier. I can actually see the viewfinder screen. It fits on the screen just fine and stays on. I folds up to fit in my bag nicely. Recommended for anyone who shoots outside a lot. 
23756 4 This works great on my monopod and was so inexpensive. 
23757 4 Very accurate delivery time 👍🏼 Thank you! 
23758 4 Great fit. Customise interior to suit. Holds 5 batteries, spare props, ipad, prop guards. Feel confident my P3P could arrive safely in spite of the best efforts of airline baggage handlers. Will put it to the test this winter. Similar quality to Pelican. 
23759 4 I love it! Material and appearance was just as expected, and I like that I can double it as a purse :) 
23760 4 perfect 
23761 4 Fits well you need to cut to fit 
23762 4 Works as stated. 
23763 3 Screen was a perfect replacement. A little assistance from a YouTube video and fixed my camera in 15 minutes and at a fraction of the cost of taking it to a repair centre. 
23764 3 Only fair. 
23765 3 expectations were met for this order. 
23766 3 Great product! 
23767 3 Not hi tech 
23768 4 Great camera; easy to use. 
23769 3 Appears to be good quality, easy to apply. I m not very good at applying stickers however it still looks great 
23770 4 Amazing.. I loved it!!! 
23771 4 nice 
23772 4 This is a terrific cord. I especially appreciate te short length of it which helps with the camera to flash on a bracket problem without havig so much extra cord that it gets in the way. All functions on the flash work perfectly. 
23773 3 Nice camera and good pictures/video. Needs more accessories. Camera does not fit into clip 1 so the only way to hold the camera is with the waterproof case. That makes it inconvenient for using it as a dash cam or such. 
23774 4 Great price for what I was looking for. Fast shipping. 
23775 4 Just the right size for my camera and travel gear. Very well made and sturdy enough for expeditions and such. Case Logic is a company whose quality has always been top notch in my opinion and this camera case is no exception. 
23776 2 Not quite as pictuerd, There is no drain on the one I got and there is a folding center handle and also the lable that was on the lid was very dificult to remove and left glue residue 
23777 3 Steppers functioned properly and included specifications were helpful. Included PC board makes mating with Arduino quite easy. 
23778 4 Excellent batteries 
23779 4 This camera is so easy to use. I purchased it mostly to take pictures of my children, but I have since expanded. Ive had a canon t4 rebel, and this is definitely better and more convenient. 
23780 4 charges my camera up right 
23781 4 great 
23782 2 Mine leaked as well. Still floated, but worried about future use. Free diving in 15-30 deep water. Great tool and easy to point and shoot, but again worried about the seal and it filling with water and sinking :( 
23783 4 Not disappointed 
23784 3 great case for a camera and your essentials. great quality. Just a tad on the small side. Still not sure if I m going to keep or return it. 
23785 4 Does the job. 
23786 3 This was a gift to go with the phantom great combo... 
23787 4 I am happy with the drone. it works great 
23788 1 cheap / should have brought the real thing 
23789 0 No good 
23790 4 These are great lens cloths, you can t beat them for the price. I keep them all over the place to make sure I never find myself without one. Plus, they rep the best Nikon users forum on the internet, how could you possibly go wrong? 
23791 4 Fits in place very easily, blocks out most of the unwanted light and made of soft rubber so very comfortable. 
23792 4 Worked as expected. I passed this one on to my Grandson. 
23793 4 Works just as expected, charges my camera batteries quickly. Great deal for so many accessories, and now I won t get caught with a dead battery all the time. 
23794 3 Nice system for the cost. 
23795 4 great seller - delivered as promised! 
23796 4 Good battery, good fit for canon camera and battery life is on par with factory OEM battery. 
23797 3 good product 
23798 4 Great product, Thanks. 
23799 4 this camra does a great job. I love it 
23800 3 Camera stream is awesome! The only issue so far is getting the video to record on motion. 
23801 4 Fit good 
23802 4 Not much to say.. Does its job, seems to have a comparable life span to the Nikon counter part. :) 
23803 4 Perfect 
23804 3 Works fine. Took off a point for lack of clear instructions. I had to find video instructions from Orion on YouTube. I was able to figure it out from that. Well made. 
23805 4 I film a lot of events, and this lens helps me get those emotional close up / shallow focus shots without having to move my gear all over the place. 
23806 4 Received all ordered items promptly; everything works well. 
23807 4 Shipped quickly. Seem to be just a tad wider that the originals. Still work though. 
23808 4 Works perfectly. Haven t had any issues with this adapter 
23809 2 Not as expected, but great to learn on. 
23810 4 Works well, good suction to smooth surfaces as long as they re clean. 
23811 0 No web interface for configuration or viewing. Realize solely on mobile Android or iOS app. Camera goes offline several times a day and you must power cycle the camera to bring it back online. When the camera does operate, it works well with good image quality and speedy PTZ. 
23812 3 Film worked as intended, wish it was less cost effective, remember to not shake the photos and to place in the box the film came in to help develop them faster. 
23813 4 The battery was exactly what I needed 
23814 1 This item was returned as it did not support continuous streaming. I also found their customer support to be subpar. I returned it and paid the extra money for a nest camera. 
23815 4 Excellent 
23816 0 battery consumer and sucks the flash doesnt turn on at all times 
23817 4 Good Back Up Camera or for indoor. 
23818 4 Perfect. 
23819 3 Works great #GFGENT 
23820 3 Very clear in quiet areas. However when there is a fan near by or loud ac, it causes interfence and you will hear static throughout the entire recording, or sometimes not even record sound. 
23821 3 great purchase 
23822 4 this is my fourth manfrotto bag they are just grate lots of customizable things and great weight balance when you have your laptop + camera overall a great product 
23823 4 Works great! 
23824 4 Perfect replacement for original D750 Eyecup. 
23825 4 Perfect if you want to pack in your suitcase. 
23826 4 I love this camera. I wanted one that takes batteries and this is the one. I m still learning all the possibilities with this camera. It s very nice. 
23827 3 great seller - delivered as promised! 
23828 4 Works great! 
23829 4 looking forward to using in belize. 
23830 2 Inability to set shutter speed below 1 second makes it less useful for my application. 
23831 4 Love it Way to go with go pro 
23832 1 It s not very stable but thankfully it worked for what I needed to do. 
23833 4 Great mount got to 100 mile per hour on my motorcycle it the camera didn t flinch a bit Is great to take great shot and can be used on almost any helmet. Go pro outdid themselves 
23834 4 All sorts of FUN crafty items to dress up the photographs. Bright colors and designs. My granddaughter just loves this. I gave this pack of accessories as a birthday present along with the Mini 8 instant camera. (Everything old is new again! Remember the old Polaroids?) 
23835 3 Does what it said it would. 
23836 4 I love this hand grip, it was so much easier to carry my camera around with this grip. I am not a big fan of having my camera dangle around my neck. 
23837 4 Works great! Love the attachments...it is a lot easier than the 3..not as dramatic for the counter balancing 
23838 4 Awesome camera and great customer service from Calvin 
23839 4 I used the RFN-4s kit for the first time last week and it worked flawlessly on every shot. Set up and installation was easy, I am very satisfied 
23840 2 ok 
23841 4 NIce quality 
23842 4 Work great d5300 in vello battery grip. No errors. 
23843 3 Tricky to power on. Hold the power button for more than 4 sec. 
23844 1 When I got his camera it looked like the package had been opened and when I turned on the camera it had 3 photo saved to the camera of a person and his house. It sketched me out so I am taking it back and getting a new one. 
23845 0 The first time I used it, one of the prongs stayed in the wall socket when I unplugged it. 
23846 3 What I like 1) distributes weight well 2) camera always at the ready 3) camera is in a comfortable position for walking 4) strap attaches to the cameras strap lug securely and does not obstruct use of my tripod - great strap 
23847 4 Camera is great good working condition, actually its like brand new 
23848 4 Excellent. 
23849 4 Exceeded our expectations. Work great and I got these 4 for the same price of just ONE at Best buy. More like &#34;Worst buy&#34; if you ask me. Thanks CamKix! 
23850 2 Resolution is good if the camera does not move - takes a while to fill in detail. Wifi is very difficult to set up. I use DHCP reservation but the IP does not renew properly without multiple power cycles. 
23851 3 I like them alot 
23852 4 perfect replacement for the original 
23853 4 Fits great, functions as advertised. I love it and I m happy that I saved so much money. 
23854 0 If there is a product deserving on 0 stars then this is it! It does not even do basic magnification let alone night vision! The material looks deceptively metallic when in fact its only a very cheap plastic. 
23855 4 I was so impressed at the quality of these batteries. They are as good if not better than my Canon and Wasabi Power batteries. Well worth the price! 
23856 4 excellent 
23857 4 Cheaper and quicker than ordering from china 
23858 4 compact sized yet versatile. i can use it on my portable cameras and accessorizing with some attachments, also with cell phones. 
23859 4 It was larger then I was looking for .....had to return....but looked like a great camera. 
23860 3 This NVR is perfect, comes with 4 x 100ft Ethernet cables and the cameras are very nice. Hate the software interface, hence 4 stars. The software for viewing and replaying recording could be more user friendly. 
23861 4 best idea ever... 
23862 2 Battery is slightly smaller than my original, causing it to fit uneasily into the battery charger provided with the Camera, but it did charge OK and does fit into the phone without difficulty and seems to work OK. 
23863 4 The battery fits, and worked right away. 
23864 3 the only down side to the kit was the selfie stick...it spins upside down under the go pro s weight, otherwise excellent. 
23865 3 Met requirements 
23866 4 I was amazed by all the extras I got with the camera. The pictures are outstanding. 
23867 4 Dresses up the GoPro 3. Need a wrench to tighten thumb screws. Can t get a grip on them with fingers to tighten the GoPro so it won t move. 
23868 4 Camera is great for the first time DSLR user! In my case that happens to be a 13 year old - and she is now taking incredible photos and having fun. 
23869 4 At the price point this works great for off-camera flash power! I m a wedding photographer and can use it almost all day with rechargeable batteries before I need to swap in new batteries. 
23870 1 It is a little slow with regards to synchronizing with the phone/app. 
23871 2 Very easy to use....not great quality picture 
23872 3 Nice looking leather case. Good colour. Seems sturdy enough. 
23873 4 Love this camera.. Easy to set up and easy to use.. It notifies me right on my iphone and I just click on the app and I see everything. I love the fact that I can look back and see stuff.. 
23874 4 Its geniune Pelican Case. Very duriable. Been every where with it since I bought it and it is still good as new.... inside. 
23875 4 i love it...as expected 
23876 2 Pretty sturdy for the price, nice direct lighting, although to need all four up to get a well lit scene, and it s almost impossible to iron the wrinkles out of the supplied back drops. 
23877 4 Seem to work just as well as the one that came with my camera 
23878 4 Got these in perfect condition. Great for off camera flash and works just as good as Pocketwizard but a fraction of the price. You can use them for fill flash outside or to help compensate low light at wedding receptions. added bonus- was here 2 days after I ordered them! 
23879 4 My granddaughter enjoyed using the stickers on her photos. 
23880 3 Cheap and plentiful microfiber cloths. I wear glasses, so I like to have access to these things in various locations throughout my apartment. They re also good for cleaning laptops, computer screens, and phones. They re useful and effective. 
23881 4 Super Sweet! 
23882 3 It s simply fit and well. I don t know how good the one made by Fuji, but this one just works no problem at all. And the price is something that you don t even need to have a second thought. 
23883 3 Looks very good! Fits my canon g7x just fine. No space for anything else! 
23884 4 The product, packaging and supplies are all wonderful. The camera is easy to use and light weight, highly recommended. 
23885 3 Definitely too expensive but it s never let me down 
23886 4 amazing camera! 
23887 4 Leo was very knowledgeable and able to set it up very quickly for me via remote setup! 
23888 4 Excellent value for backup power. 
23889 1 Doesn t fit - and was returned 
23890 4 Works just like expensive version 
23891 4 Haven t used it yet, but sure it will do the trick 
23892 4 Fabulous for the price. The moslins are a little thin, but what do you expect for the price. Also, ironing them was a bit of a pain, but that s the nature of the beast. 
23893 4 Love the it😀 
23894 4 Good Film that s all. 
23895 2 Had to make a few alterations for horseback riding but overall not a bad little system. Only bad point is that I had to get a locking washer for the screw for the camera, it would back out very easily before hand 
23896 3 Good fit on 70 to 200 f 2.8 zoom lens 
23897 4 Very convenient and light to carry around 
23898 4 awesome and very compact 
23899 4 just the best 
23900 4 Great Backpack! Plenty of room for everything. Deep pockets and tons of padding to protect your valuable equipment. Protects my laptop as well in a separate compartment. 
23901 4 excellent extremely good; outstanding. 
23902 2 A bit heavy but sturdy. 
23903 0 I don t like the legs because the bottoms always falls off. However, when I tried to return, it charges almost $7, so I guess I will keep it. :( 
23904 4 My favorite camera. This is the third one I m buying in a row. 
23905 4 Fab 
23906 4 Great photos, waterproof. Tough casing. Get it. 
23907 3 Light and comfortable against the eye. Fit s well but doesn t &#34;click&#34; on and can come off easily. 
23908 3 Nice set, affordable price! 
23909 4 Good 
23910 4 thank u 
23911 4 All Good A++ 
23912 4 Go with camkix Unless you want it to say gopro on it 
23913 4 I bought these as replacement batteries. The work perfect and now I don t have to worry if my battery goes dead when I am taking pictures because I have a backup. 
23914 3 Very cool little frame, it doesn t have the quality of a computer monitor but it is pretty good. 
23915 4 Camera was in great shape.instructions were easy to read. 
23916 3 Fits everything for my camera. The parts do not fit perfectly, but they are all in there and safe. 
23917 4 I am very happy with this camera. Looks like new. Came with a carry bag and two 16 GB memory cards. Those memory cards are good for pictures but too slow for video with XAVC S format. 
23918 4 Can t use my camera without this... 
23919 3 Great bundle, all components work well and very much with the money! In the down side the backpack was not as big as it looks in the picture and the. Inserts are very thin, it took some maneuvering to get my cameras to fit. Still a great kit 
23920 4 I was having a problem getting my new F19828P camera to work on my laptop, even though it worked on my desktop. I called Foscam and spoke to Calvin and he made some adjustments to the laptop and now everything is operating fine. Foscam tech support is great. 
23921 4 Battery grip Arrived as promised, best 3rd party battery grip out there. I would recommend this company and grip as excellent. 
23922 4 on time and well packaged .Still playing with it but so far works great .I may get an extra battery for convience 
23923 4 Suprising picture quality 
23924 0 Didnt even last a week the product was so poorly made out of cheap plastic 
23925 4 I love my new camera 
23926 4 It did exactly what I wanted it to do. Did not need recharging very frequently. 
23927 4 A real good add on camera with night vision. Great price too. 
23928 4 this is a great camera for the average photographer. my wife takes thousands of pictures a year of our grand kids and she then puts them in a shutterfly book. great camera. 
23929 2 Its ok and could hold all my accessories, but after two few months, the stitching at the zippers came apart. I guess this camera bag insert should not be used without its backpack - [[ASIN:B00J3YFW16 Jill-E Digital 15&#34; Jack Laptop Backpack Case (Brown) with Camera Insert Bag + Cleaning Kit]]. 
23930 0 didn t work 
23931 3 They were good and I ll make it so you can reach out and get your camera 
23932 4 Great product-delivery and service. Very happy with the charger and it arrived hours earlier than expected. Thank you. 
23933 4 nice 
23934 3 Good 
23935 4 perfect!!!!!! 
23936 3 I love the design and compactness 
23937 4 great 
23938 4 It s all ok! 
23939 3 I used it once and it appears to have charged the batteries that I ordered along with the product. 
23940 4 love it - 2nd one 
23941 4 Nice device and yes, it does have an internal single AA battery that can be changed. 
23942 3 Works as advertised.. 
23943 4 Handy 
23944 4 Very satisfied 
23945 4 I got it 
23946 4 Excelente 
23947 3 good 
23948 3 Battery is working good, but du not have capacity of original ones. 
23949 2 they work but some of them were already dried out 
23950 0 The software doesen t recognise the camera and after an hour of capturing videos a transistor exploded and the camera stopped working. 80$ burned out. 
23951 0 had to return it it didn t have a way to secure the battery for charging 
23952 4 Love the camera, takes great pictures, and easy to download to print up pictures too. Thank you, 
23953 4 Is a great camera and does the job very nice. Would absolutely recommend it. 
23954 4 It really works well, a lot of stuff to figure out but who needs to know everything. 
23955 4 Perfect fit! 
23956 4 Camera still doesn t work 
23957 2 This &#34;small&#34; harness is almost too large for my 60 lb pit bull. Fits my barrel chested boxer pretty well though. 
23958 4 Works Perfect ! 
23959 4 Love it !!! Works great !!! 
23960 4 I m very happy with this item I will buy more 
23961 4 Very good product at low cost. 
23962 4 ok 
23963 4 The Huge grip and feel of this Grip makes me partial to Kupo C-Stands. 
23964 4 Excellent 
23965 4 Pelican - what more can one say. Used for a GoPro. Still fitting in accessories. Allows custom fit cut outs. The foam is notched so you have some cutting guide lines. Use a long slender knife to cut the foam along the perforations. 
23966 0 This product is terrible. It says the product is new strait out of the box but it must have came broken. wouldn t turn on even with a full charge. really upsetting and a waste of money. confusing to use and cheaply made. 
23967 4 Great camera love it! 
23968 4 Awesome! 
23969 0 Well my review is it just don t work well, no instructions, no video, very little sound. For the price it is headed to the trash can. Sorry 
23970 4 Great price, battery works......I m very pleased with this company s services and I highly recommend Thanks, Annemarie C. 
23971 0 They work great....until they stop working. Slow recycling time on 1/128 power and when fired by the 560 TX is fires full power then shuts down. 
23972 4 It is very orange. I love it. 
23973 4 These strobes work great. I am happy with purchase. 
23974 4 good 
23975 0 Battery would not charge from the get-go, I have been unable to access the warranty policy, or a phone number for help..... 
23976 4 This pouch set is well made, protective and stylish. Small size is adequate for pancake lenses and, medium size is good enough for Canon 18-55 STM kit lens. I m still not using the large one but it s nice to have it already for a future lens. 
23977 4 Works perfectly, shipped promptly, good priçe, 
23978 4 For the price the product is not bad. 
23979 4 Great 
23980 0 Horrible. Does not work well. 
23981 4 Haven t had to use it but it s there if something goes wrong with my Samsung camera. 
23982 3 Perfect! Bought these for my sis s wedding and the ones leftover I took with me on a Europe tour! 
23983 3 wasn t listed that a gender changer was needed 
23984 4 excellent 
23985 4 Very Happy 
23986 4 The camera is great. It s very easy to use and is wonderfully compact. The pictures I took are superb. I highly recommend it. 
23987 4 im head over heels in love with this camera. And the whole kit for the price is just amazing! Everything is of good quality even thought they re &#34;extras&#34;. I m so happy I made the leap and bought this kit! 
23988 4 Good product over all. Feels very sturdy on my monopod. 
23989 4 Does the job for a low price. 
23990 4 Great camera 
23991 1 would have been better if i didnt have to buy a hard drive for it... 
23992 4 great product 
23993 0 difficult to handle, it is not functional 
23994 2 Told I needed these for my camera. Seems to help. 
23995 4 Perfect fit. 
23996 4 I am totally impressed with this camera. Even the battery lasts indefinitely when it sits without being used. I HIGHLY recommend this camera! 
23997 4 Great product! 
23998 3 Cute camera but veery small view finder. Got as a gift for 11 years old. 
23999 4 Perfect. As promised, but I was surprised at how small the velvet bag was. Didn t know what it was for anyway, so it is still perfect for me. 
24000 3 Good flash for the price. Plan to use as a second flash when shooting portraits. My only negative is that the user manual is written very poorly. It s difficult to read and sometimes misleading.This flash has 8 custom function settings of which 3 are not mentioned in the manual. 
24001 4 THIS LENS IS AMAZING. If you were only to have one lens, have this one. The shallow depth of field and low light capability can t be beaten. 
24002 3 Ok+ 
24003 0 Thank I used it as soon I get it works very good, thank you! 
24004 0 DO NOT BUY FROM BESTPRICEAM, PIECES MISSING, NOT WORTH THE TIME TO SEND BACK. 
24005 4 great one but doenst snap it will keep on turning 
24006 3 Doesn t work so well in shady areas. Maybe it is the IR blocking filter. So if you re going to be flying through the woods, this isn t the way to go. 
24007 4 Works like a champ! 
24008 4 I am very impressed with the results. The product has a great price. and just the Tripod alone was worth the price. Big bang for the buck. 
24009 4 Fantastic Camera for Construction sites. Easily programmable and takes great time lapse videos 
24010 4 Extremely fast shipping. Quick and easy installation and programming into my existing 2gig system; all at a fraction of the purchase/installation offered by a security systems installer. 
24011 1 I ordered a dark brown frame and received a black frame 
24012 3 Looks very realistic. Cheaply made, but once they are mounted, that should not be an issue. 
24013 4 Great Product 
24014 4 Actually my wife loves it. I just carry the camera bag. 
24015 4 Great drone. Yes its an older model but I have already captured some amazing vids and pics with it and will be using it for my upcoming school project. 
24016 0 didn t work with any of my speedlites. 
24017 4 very good material 
24018 4 Wonderful bag very nice to have a large compartment that doesn t collapse. 
24019 4 Easy to direct ligh, hold shapes 
24020 4 This product is great hooked it to my go pro and love it! 
24021 4 Very good experience! Would recommend this seller always! 
24022 4 Works well, makes for a solid base and is easy to get on-off. 
24023 4 Great product. Fast shipping. 
24024 3 Bought this to pair with my Sony a6000 and it works well! I ve been taking pictures of plants and insects and you ve got to get realllllly close, but the detail is fantastic. The only drawback:The aluminum casing scratches VERY easily. 
24025 1 This camera was ok but does not do well in low light conditions. 
24026 4 Love it 
24027 4 Awesome. Great price. Fit my sons camera perfectly. Durable and long lasting. 
24028 4 This is exactly what I hoped it would be. Fits everything in for the drone and a few extras so I don t have to lug another bag along. 
24029 4 Very loud and light weight ! I ll take it on all my runs and everywhere I go. I won t leave home without it... 
24030 4 excellent 
24031 4 I ordered the expert shield and it was delivered in three days, that was with standard shipping, great service. the shield fits perfectly, couldn t ask for a better fit. the price is very reasonable for this kind of quality. racinsailor 
24032 2 the trade name was not neewer. 
24033 4 The product arrived on time and it was just what I needed. Would buy again. 
24034 4 On time. As described. 
24035 4 Works fantastic! I love controlling all my speedlights from one place. 
24036 4 My dropcam pro stopped working and the Nest company replaced it for me free. Very supportive and reliable company and the new cam works brilliantly. The company was very responsive and quick with their service. Thanks Nest! So I have bought another cam. 
24037 3 good camera for its purpose 
24038 4 Very satisfied 
24039 1 I m unimpressed with the feel of this. It doesn t hold he phone straight for a larger phone. It s very expensive for what it is and doesn t seem it will last. 
24040 4 Purchased to go with the Uniden system I purchase from Costco that only had two cameras. This synced perfectly with it and works really well. Good night vision too. 
24041 4 So far so good. GoPro Hero black consumes batteries to fast so it is good for moments where you cant find any other ellectrical source. 
24042 3 I bought a total of 4, I like them! 
24043 0 It really is an awful piece. The camera itself is OK tough the stand is bizarre and difficult to use as is the focus on the camer. The Software is junk 
24044 3 Great lens, amazing for landscape and night time photography 
24045 0 terrible quality cloth 
24046 4 This camera is great for action shots and has a lot of extras for enhancing pictures. The extra battery pack and SD cards were a bonus that was great to have. 
24047 4 I love this, I basically wanna take it everywhere. READ HOW TO ADJUST YOUR ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING BEFORE TAKING YOUR PICTURES. If they come out horrible, it s cause you did it wrong. 
24048 2 expected better resolution. 
24049 4 Works perfectly and came on time. 
24050 3 Ok 
24051 2 Nothing is broken so far, havent set it up yet but will whenever i have time 
24052 2 Cool 
24053 4 This camera has a very nice option you can select, I think it s called the &#34;beauty or beautiful&#34; mode, basically a soft version of portrait photo shop. People always say before your ready to take their, &#34;make me look young and beautiful&#34; this camera does that. Very nice. 
24054 0 Piece of junk. Does not work. Do not buy. 
24055 4 Just replaced one failed WANSVIEW CAM after two years with this one. Image is much better. I have not tested memory card yet. Hope it will work and last longer. 
24056 4 Great bag, fits a lot of equipment. Handy for water environments. 
24057 4 Great I will buy more 
24058 3 Well made. Would buy again. 
24059 2 hard to figure out how to use for the average person 
24060 4 As advertised 
24061 0 To start with, the canvas boxes in which they come are the poorest quality posible. The packege i got, did not include the bateríes. 
24062 4 works well for good price, sellers contacted me immediately after to let me know there is a warranty and to make sure there were no problems. 
24063 4 Excelente... 
24064 4 fits perfectly, as to be expected from OEM items 
24065 4 Keeps the GoPro clipped in and the mount is tight. It is not going anywhere. 
24066 4 Brought this to use w/JOTO 6-inch Waterproof Case pouch, for family & everyone LOVED THIS GIFT!!! 
24067 4 Very good item! I will purchase another soon...it s worth the money. Pictures are clear, I added a ring light to increase lighting and it help too. 
24068 4 We ll see. I purchased this to replace a unit that fail from a different manufacturer. So far, so good. I will update in time if needed. 
24069 4 This has been a great camera which is very easy to use and takes great pictures. Larger than the ones that slip in a pocket but that s not a problem for me. 
24070 4 Great tool for converting slides to digital images. Get one and pass it around your family. You ll probably only use it once but the time it saves and the memories you recover are worth it. 
24071 1 Much of the film either didn t develop or developed very, very slowly (we re talking hours). Kind of a bummer for the high price. 
24072 4 Fits all the standard GoPro Accessories. Worth the money. Good construction an good foam. 
24073 4 This item is a excellent piece of equipment,the size was perfect to fit my camera and cellphone. 
24074 4 love it 
24075 3 Very good picture quality, just a little overheat when u transfer picture to smartphone 
24076 2 What can one expect for so little money. Recommend spending the extra cash to purchase a higher quality tube kit. 
24077 0 It did not work. 
24078 4 These microprism screens are wonderful -- I put them in my EOS 1N/1V, and I love working with them. 
24079 3 A good solid camera for our son (11). He has used it at home and at camp and it s lasted through it all! Great pictures and lots of memories. 
24080 4 I lost the center column of my 190 tripod on a shoot and needed to replace it and this was the perfect solution. Works great. 
24081 4 Very easy to install, great video quality, strong wifi connection, love that it zooms in and out and pans smoothly, totally worth the price. Been through two other wifi monitors and I was so upset with those but now I m happy with this! 
24082 4 LOVE IT!!! 
24083 3 Seems as though it will work well though no real trial use of product yet. 
24084 3 Good concert binoculars. Some might find them a little heavy after awhile but I paired them with a Monopod and there perfect. 
24085 4 Worked and fit great for my camera. Best underwater photos taken...No filmy look on the images from the case. 
24086 3 Foam doesn t seem to fit the drone perfectly, but good enough. 
24087 2 Terrible terrible menu. Borderline retarded. Very expensive prime lenses. Fast. Hunts for focus while doing video though... 
24088 4 This is a Great Tripod! I put my Leica T62 Spotting scope on it and at the range or in the field it is great. I have killed many Coyotes and Rabbits using it to spot or as a rest. It is Killin Machine! Get one!! 
24089 4 Works just like the Nikon battery. 
24090 4 thanks 
24091 4 Image and construction quality are great! 
24092 4 Patrick Good service from Patrick and 5 stars rating for this service good quality of camera 
24093 3 Great for the price. 
24094 0 arrived and didnt work. 
24095 4 Bought a new camera with two lenses. For one I had a bunch of filters from my old 35mm, but the other was incompatible, so I ordered this pack to help in the field. So far, great results. 
24096 4 This is an excellent addition to the pro 40 - 150 and given the price and weight, makes for a 420mm f4 in a small package compared with anything else available. Optical quality is also excellent. 
24097 4 Great 
24098 2 Versatile, but not intuitive. Tendency to not be able to fully capture batteries. I have to secure then to the charger with a rubber band. 
24099 1 Worked for two years, then zippers ripped out. 
24100 4 Great when I m shooting concerts. Two thumbs up. 
24101 4 I m enjoying my new charger for my camera. No more dead batteries. 
24102 2 Good quality, great value. We ve been having difficulty charging the batteries and have to keep them plugged in almost constantly. We will likely be contacting the seller for assistance in the near future. 
24103 4 All hail the D-76, King of the developers. 
24104 4 The tripod doesn t fit in the camera case, that why it comes with its own carrying case. I like the whole kit. No complaints. 
24105 4 Fast service great product 
24106 3 Very good camera, fast shooting in any luminosity, easy to configure, small and confortable to handle. The only problem is the lack of a lens cap. For this we have to be always careful not to touch or let the lens touch anything. 
24107 4 love it. husband wears glasses and can bird watch from his chair, 
24108 3 Great Product 
24109 4 Excellent product and excellent service. 
24110 4 Does the trick. Protects the lens. A must-have for a nice lens. 
24111 2 It s awesome 
24112 3 Great for action videos such as bike riding skateboarding, etc 
24113 3 Sharp broad field of view. A little pricy but better than the cheap zoom models. 
24114 4 The cap works great. I would buy again. 
24115 1 broke after 3 months 
24116 4 Great product, has never scratched any lens I have used them on. 
24117 4 I have enjoyed using my Canary and watching it evolve. Customer satisfaction is paramount to these guys, so it is not done evolving. I am thouroughly satisfied and can t wait to see some of the up and coming features! 
24118 3 Does not come with clip accessory to put gopro on, need to buy that separate. 
24119 4 I wanted something I could strap my gorpo too that would float so when I brought it to the beach it wouldn t sink. So far in the pool it does just that and the added wrist strap is awesome so it doesn t float away. 
24120 4 Did the job, the price was right. 
24121 4 I needed a sports wifi cam asap for a trip and I got this camera on time for my trip. The camera works great, no issues. Will order again from this seller!!!! Great job :) 
24122 4 Very useful. 
24123 4 Pretty awesome product. Lenses fit perfectly. Couldn t be happier. 
24124 4 Since I live in a more urban area, these come in handy as I m always trying to sneak in a small or regular. They are very water proof, so the logs will stay dry without a baggie. Overall, really great product, I would buy it again! 
24125 4 High end feel. Protects well. Never loosens, much easier to keep clean than other UV filters that I own. 
24126 4 great tripod 
24127 4 Great 
24128 1 Horrible video quality not practical 
24129 4 Works as expected! 
24130 3 Tested it right away in water for an extended period before using it with camera. I hope to take it snorkeling this fall. 
24131 3 Spy camera. Looks pretty nice. The output is alright, not that great but I am not choosy 
24132 3 Good ++++ 
24133 4 Fast service. Satisfied. 
24134 4 I love it 
24135 4 4 years later and I still love this camera 
24136 4 Very good versatile lens. 
24137 3 Item delivered on time, was as described 
24138 2 Love my camera except for the fact it came with instructions in Japanese, or chineses, or Korean..... they were everything but English 
24139 4 Fast service, quality items 
24140 4 very pleased with both the charger and the batteries 
24141 4 Love! So adorable. 
24142 4 Photographs great, doesn t wrinkle. Wish I was a little bigger 
24143 4 Have not used much other than the batteries and chargers. Others have said hard to get out of charger. I found it quite ready. Love having the extra chargers while away from outlets. Great luxury to have! 
24144 4 Strong and versatile. A must! You can, of course, combine it with various camera, tablet or smartphone holder. My regret about this one: not getting one or two sooner. Seriously! 
24145 0 Three of the items were NOT what was pictured, and were of significantly lower quality. I returned it. 
24146 4 Great lens for the money buy now before the price increases. 
24147 4 blast 
24148 4 Works just as good as the original. 
24149 3 Great. 
24150 4 This works well for my son s Sony camera. 
24151 0 terrible. I do not recommend. the flash is late and doesn t supply a clear image 
24152 4 Perfect camera replacement cord 
24153 4 Great, 
24154 4 Works as advertised. For long exposure photos, you would want to use in lower light conditions. But the colors come out good and it works as it should. 
24155 4 It was as expected. Worked fine. 
24156 1 Won t keep the right setting very hard to get programmed very disappointed with this item. 
24157 0 The cameras offer a very poor picture during daylight hours. The cameras also get hot for some odd reason. I removed them from my system to prevent any issues. I have other HD-CVI cameras that offer a better picture. Do not spend you money on these. 
24158 4 Great camera - replacement for ZS40 on which we shot about 40,000 photos! 
24159 4 Everything was as promised. Thanks! 
24160 4 I bought for my daughter for Christmas and she seems to love it. 
24161 2 Good value for cheap price, works fine, but while the flattening is space efficient, the assembly is fussy. 
24162 4 Very cool product. 
24163 4 I have both the small and medium bag and love them both. 
24164 0 Don t waste your money on this one unless you can live with terrible video quality. There is no way this is a 720P camera. Spend the extra money and get a 9805P that has excellent video 
24165 4 Good 
24166 4 Great macro for my GoPro Hero 4 Silver. Awesome quality and comes with a little tether and Amazing bag for it. Perfect 
24167 4 thanks 
24168 4 Was very shocked at first that it held very well to my windshield, just have other problems with various suction mounts. Will buy another one soon to mount in the back of my cab. 
24169 4 I love this bag! Fits my camera and accessories perfectly!! And it is bigger than I expected, bonus!! 
24170 2 I Found my own ways to Hook the gopro onto my bike comfortably and stable. They seemed like a solid idea. 
24171 3 Its a great tool but has to be treated with great care as the top rotating part can easily break off. 
24172 4 I used this for my g3 wireless mics. It s an affordable case that adds protection and professionalism. 
24173 3 Camera was easy to operate and waterproof. Picture quality was good, but not great. 
24174 4 works great! 
24175 4 Very great batteries! They last for 6 hours each on my Sony CX900 
24176 3 I have not had the opportunity to use much yet, but happy with what I ve done so far. 
24177 4 good thank you 
24178 4 got this for my girlfriend and she loves it. if she s happy with it, i m happy with it. 
24179 3 Very good for price. 
24180 2 When it is finally set up it works great. But Foscam had to screen share my computer to get it set up. Way too complicated! 
24181 4 Excellent! 
24182 3 Case was as advertised,strong,roomy,except for the prop guards,but I m satisfied! 
24183 4 Very nice monocular , I like it and clear and a lot better than the other one I have which is a 10 power and 42 mm Thanks 
24184 3 Works great! 
24185 3 You can carry a bunch of stuff not related to the camera. Passport, money and other documents. I see it as kind of a man s purse. 
24186 4 Works like a camera lens should 😏 
24187 3 The strap is short, wish it was longer. 
24188 3 good deal 
24189 4 Shipped and arrived quickly. The product is exactly as explained and fits my lense perfectly. Thanks for the great buy at an affordable price! 
24190 4 So far so good! We ll see how the quality is and how it functions underwater when we take our upcoming trip. 
24191 3 It s cheap, it works. Doesn t have the non-reflective felt lining that the genuine Canon hood has, but I can t complain for the price. 
24192 4 The best camera addition I have purchased. The grip holds two batteries. I love it 
24193 4 very tight first few uses, but improves to sturdy fit as flexed to the shape of your speedlight. super cheap and effective - thumbs up. 
24194 4 This is great 400 speed film and very reasonably priced. I like it in TMax developer. 
24195 4 There s not much to say about this battery that hasn t already been said. It works as a great replacement for the more expensive batteries and I can t tell the difference. 
24196 4 Power 2000 ACD-235 Replacement for Casio NP-40. This product rocks!!! I take a lot of pictures with my camera and now no matter what I have a charged battery ready to go. The charge stay longer and it is easy!Thanks 
24197 4 This kit is AWESOME! I can t believe how well everything works. Everything fits into the pouch and it slips onto the strap of my camera bag. 
24198 4 Lost the little black piece to cover the SD card... the rest helped too 
24199 4 Was exactly what I expected 
24200 4 The camera looks amazingly real, with red flashing light and the wires coming from back. 
24201 4 Very prompt fulfillment. Tremendous deal vs. normal retail. Very satisfied 
24202 4 exelent 
24203 4 This backpack has changed my level of orginization, and comfertablity with my equipment. All around best bagg out in the market. Its a must have. 
24204 4 Very good deal for all these items... Everything works great! 
24205 4 Arrived earlier than expected and product is as advertised. 
24206 4 This is awesome product 
24207 3 The really is a great starter kit. Using the tripod/monopod with my intro Canon DSLR worked great. I never worried about the tripod falling over or anything. But it is definitely for beginners. 
24208 4 We bought this for a gift and pre-loaded pictures of the kids on it. We liked it so much that we re ordering one for ourselves. 
24209 3 Good solid bag, got it on sale so it was a good buy... 
24210 4 I have 3 of them since 2013. They re all still working. On 2 of my car and 1 of my motorcycle. 
24211 0 Limited field of view. Past event vowing very cumbersome. Night vision useless. Merely just a webcam if that 
24212 4 Very nicely made case. We have not put it to use yet, but will soon. 
24213 3 clarity is great the hood can be a problem ,it can go on crooked which show up in the photo 
24214 4 Great 
24215 4 Really bright. Don t look into light. Get the diffusion cover. Must get Sony type battery separately to use light. Bluer than sunlight. Works well with reflector umbrella. Brightness is adjustable. 
24216 4 Works perfect on my Nikon DSLR 5100. 
24217 0 They didn t provide how to sync the device. I called the manufacturer and they wanted to charge me $50 for the answer. 
24218 4 I love this pack. It does all I wanted it to do. 
24219 3 Recommended 100 % excellent product 
24220 4 Perfect. 
24221 3 great but instructions were in chinesse 
24222 4 Cheap and good quality 
24223 4 so far so good 
24224 4 QUICK SERVICE ,GOOD QUALITY 
24225 4 Ordered the camera on Tuesday and received it today. Very fast shipping. Took some pics with it and works awesome and take great pics so far. 
24226 4 Excellent product. 
24227 4 Very good. Easy to unpack and easy to install. 
24228 4 Great security system doing the job that we need it for 
24229 4 The CMS software too complicated,I don`t know how to use,can you updated more easily and simply version? 
24230 4 I like GGS products, so I m fully satisfied wit this one too. It fits my camera s screen perfectly. Easy installation and great look. 
24231 0 Don t buy it! Waste of money!!!!! 
24232 2 It works good but broke after 3 events. Good temporary solution though. 
24233 4 The product was amazing everything works perfectly nice and intact shipping was almost immediate ! 
24234 3 Sturdy clips. 
24235 3 I have a Kodak Pixpro and lost my original case. Tight inside but it works. This is definitely for small cameras. The zippered pockets are also tight and cannot hold much but it worked for the charger cord during my recent vacation. The price was also very good. 
24236 4 I was a little wary at first buying this for my Sony nex 3n but it works fine! I use it for my 18-55mm lens and it s great! 
24237 3 For the price I paid, it s excellent. I like it and have no regrets. I recommend it 
24238 4 At this price point this is a great filter. I have severals B+W filters and I think this one has the same quality. 
24239 4 Outstanding!! 
24240 4 I have purchased several accessories this year for my new Nikkon d3200 camera this year. Each item s quality has been excellent and functions as described. Also, each item included a lens cloth. Would not be concerned at all about purchasing items from this seller. 
24241 4 500 slides in 4 hours and works as advertised, now its a paper weight. I will sell it for 80 bucks! 
24242 4 I bought this to use as a baby monitor and could not be happier. An underrated feature of the Nest Cam is the night vision. It s amazing and the set up is incredibly easy. 
24243 4 Perfect for theatre, clear and easy to focus. 
24244 4 Excellent item, poor internal Memory, but all good. 
24245 4 Great case. Pelican or nothing. 
24246 0 This unit was bad from the start, would not hover, always moves down or up and to the side 
24247 4 good kit 
24248 0 Didn t have the correct parts with this product 
24249 3 Great, affordable, professional variable filter. The slider ring is a bit wonky, but for the price a great buy. Use it on my Sigma 18 - 35 f/1.8. Helps me stay wide open when I need it. 
24250 4 Excellent 
24251 4 Just what we needed! 
24252 4 Perfect.... Easy to fit everything needed... And keep everything protected! 
24253 4 Worked perfectly. I recommend it. Top craftsmanship. Bought several rolls, All rolls performed at 100%. Quality Control at 100% too. I will buy again from this vendor for sure. Happy customer = repeat business!!!!!!!! 
24254 3 charge doesn t seem to last very long. 
24255 4 Excellent kit has all advertised items and seem to be very good quality. The case is perfect, all items fit in it and looks to be excellent quality. The kit has just about everything a person needs to keep camera and lens clean which will provide very high qualtiy photos. 
24256 4 Excellent, works like a champ, fits my camera (Thank you to all the other buyers who answered all my questions) and I received it so fast I was able to take it on vacation! 
24257 4 This is a great item to have on hand 
24258 1 so so 
24259 4 Freaking awesome! Love this product! 
24260 3 Good 
24261 0 I have ordered a new one. But the box was opened, display was dirty and user manual was missing. I have returned it on the same day. 
24262 4 It works perfectly! I am very happy with it!! 
24263 3 my daughter loves this camera 
24264 4 Works in my old Kodak C743. I am thrilled. It arrived quickly and as described. 
24265 4 looks exaclty as it is pictured here. havent used it yet but cant wait to. looks very heavy duty. 
24266 4 Excellent and excellent customer service. Highly recommended. 
24267 4 I know FLIR makes some amazing products but a thermal imaging unit for an iPhone??? Who would believe it? Well this actually works - and quite well. Software easy to load. Easy to set up and use. You can change the image coloration for different situations. I am truly amazed. 
24268 4 Haven t been able to use it yet but for the price you can t go wrong. 
24269 4 Just got these for my Nikkor 55-300 Lense and they are a great value and were quickly shipped. 
24270 4 Well made, I took my ripped neewer sandbags that came with the boom are and just stuffed them right inside. No complaints. 
24271 4 This is awesome for indoor photography. I can take photos indoors without using flash. What else would you want? 
24272 4 Really love d it! Something in what you can really make an investment. 
24273 4 Breathed new life into my Canon 1D Classics! unbeatable price and quality! 
24274 4 Worked as expected 
24275 4 I love it. 
24276 4 covers the lens just fine. 
24277 1 Shut the camera on and off and starts and stops the recording well. Zooming starts at one speed than goes super fast for the second half of the zoom. Why? Cheap electronics. Spend little money and you get cheap crap. Look for another. 
24278 4 Very fun to play with 
24279 0 My iPhone took better pics. Not kidding 
24280 4 Price is right, and it works fine. 
24281 2 Was too large and bulky for my purposes - it was a nice bag and well done but not for my situation. Returned with Amazon no hassle return. 
24282 4 lovely 
24283 4 I bought this for my 17 year old for her birthday. She loves it! It s retro, but easy to use. The Fugifilm Instax Accessory Bundle Set is a Must Have ! It s also easy to get film for. 
24284 4 Does what it s supposed to do! 
24285 3 Case is a little big for my camera, but it is well protected and has compartments for the charger and anything else you might need. 
24286 1 tried to get in touch with company know one answer the telephone. tried 3 times. my uniden wireless video surveillance will not record just brought it in MAY THIS YEARhttps://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41GID61XwkL._SS300_.jpg 
24287 4 Love this light, works great, well built! 
24288 4 This little thing will change my videography experience completely. 
24289 4 Good Fast service and as advertised. 
24290 3 Beware the firmware updates... mine fell out of the sky after the most recent update... moral of the story is if you have a firmware that works just stick with it and don t update. Worked amazing before that though... 
24291 4 Best purchase I have ever made :) I ve used it in so many vacations already! Perfect underwater pics! 
24292 4 item is as described by seller, reach on time. no problem so far...recommended seller and product 
24293 4 Works well, however if you zoom into scene, this doesn t show you your new &#34;frame&#34;. 
24294 4 Everything fits perfect in the bag. 
24295 4 Very comfort, very good size if you have children and need to carry their stuff and your slrs. 
24296 4 love love love my green screen! 
24297 4 Very high quality product. It has a cover for the LCD screen AND the control panel. Difficult to tell that it is even installed! 
24298 4 A great buy! 
24299 3 Good size for all you spare parts and gear. My 2 go pro fit great and plenty of cut out. 
24300 4 Great clarity and viewing anglle. Works wonderfully at night as well. IR have even assisted an older camera I have as a backup to this one. 
24301 4 So far this has been a great replacement battery. I will probably buy another one. It charged up just fine and so far has been flawless. 
24302 4 Just getting to know this wonderful camera. So far it is flawless. 
24303 4 We use these to watch birds at our feeder. My wife just loves them. They are easy to focus, use, and store. I am glad we made the purchase.. 
24304 2 Red light never stops blinking, but works as intended - A deterrent. 
24305 0 The battery was exhausted after using it two times. Learned this while on vacation. 
24306 0 No memory stick was included though it is listed!! Very bad 
24307 4 Excellent product! Very satisfied with the quality and prompt delivery. 
24308 4 Great filter, exactly as I expected. Most likely will buy a couple more.... 
24309 4 Great Service! Great Price on a very good camera! Arrived ahead of time 
24310 4 Great bag! wish the top was big enough to hold a laptop though 
24311 4 I like the design of the camera. The packing is very safety, without any damage to the camera. 
24312 4 Good Product 
24313 4 nice product, quick delivered, good description 
24314 4 Works excellent keeps my cam from fogging up. Fits well without messing up the case. 
24315 3 I like it because you can fly inside without hurting the house, kids, pets, or quad copter itself, too badly. 
24316 4 Batteries work really well. :-) received products timely. Thanks 
24317 3 All is well. I am happy with with the items purchased from this seller. However, I didn t catch the writing that said that it only extends 8&#34;.... I was under the impression that it was 18&#34;....guess there was a smudge on my eye glasses!! 
24318 4 nice bag for camera 
24319 4 Excellent beginner camera! 
24320 3 works great, but hard to close cover and can t see display on GoPro 4 Silver.... small block should be moved to other end of line than it would be perfect 
24321 4 Excellent product. Excellent transaction. 
24322 4 This camera is in perfect condition and works great. 
24323 0 I bought 3 pairs. I have tried to use 2 so far. Each box had a faulty locking mechanism on one of the stands. It would not support the Arlo in a fixed position. I am going to have to epoxy the ball in order to make it work properly. 
24324 4 Received a day early, thanks. I know where I will shop for my security needs in the future. 
24325 4 Works great. Auto open feature is nice. It fit my NX Mini very well. It is perfect for protecting the lens when not in use, and you don t have to take it off to take photo s. 
24326 4 I brought this on a road trip out west and it performed beautifully. It s funny how close you have to get to the subject to &#34;zoom&#34; in on them. I adore this lens! 
24327 4 I really like the trigger I have a Canon 600ex and a Yongnuo 600ex flash. It works great with both and has a added a new dimension to my flash photography. 
24328 4 I love the camera. It does everything they promised. Very clear picture and set up was very easy!! Loved it!! 
24329 0 I used this for one day,then this thing broke 
24330 4 The price couldn t be better for this all-manual flash, especially if you re new to using off-camera flash equipment. Being forced to use manual settings will teach you more in 10 minutes than anything. I love this guy and ll be buying more! 
24331 1 Product did not connect wirelessly at all. Worked with hardwire but free web viewing was primitive. I expected a whole lot more from Samsung 
24332 4 Excellent does what it says. 
24333 4 Outstanding Item and fast shipping. 
24334 4 Very helpful to tighten and loosen the camera mount. Recommended! 
24335 4 Really enjoying the camera. Optical zoom is incredible. 
24336 4 Smooth as butter once you learn how to handle it. There will be some delay in response when the spinning wheels have to change direction, but once you get used to it, the smoothest tracking shots will be yours! 
24337 3 Very good bundle. 
24338 4 Great telescope&#34; 
24339 4 They work perfectly fine for my cam. Needed a charger and extra batteries and nice that the bill for the price they are awesome. 
24340 0 Waste of money. The ink does not disappear, it just loses color, from blue to light grey, but everything can be read. 
24341 4 No trouble, its working, every thing its OK. 
24342 4 works well and has nice features 
24343 4 great! help a lot 
24344 4 I asked if this battery would fit the Geekpro cameras and received 2 responses, one person did not know and the other stated that it would NOT. Well, it fits perfectly, works great and came about 90% charged! I would (and probably will) buy more! 
24345 4 This flash is equivalent to the canon alternative at a fraction of the cost. I have used it for events and weddings and may never bu Canon flashes again. 
24346 4 So much fun to share these pictures w/ friends and family! 
24347 3 It s great in the sunshine. it can t perform well under low light situation... I can t even take photo in a japanese sushi bar with this lens.. I use my f4 lens instead in such situation. 
24348 4 I bought it together with Eye-fi mobi 8GB SD card for my Nikon D300. It works and I am happy with it. 
24349 3 Did fine under water 
24350 4 Buy genuine always if you want it to last for 3 years with no worries. 
24351 4 Incredible camera, prints very good quality photos. Doesn t come with an SD card so can only store about 16 photos at a time, but fantastic besides that. Ability to change exposure / etc really makes this a step up from an instax 
24352 4 Both batteries hold charge and were delivered quickly. 
24353 4 Great binos. I ve used for both for general and bird watching. These are very good for lower light situations. 
24354 4 a 
24355 4 It s a battery. It works. Charge seems just as good as the Canon batteries 
24356 4 Very cute print, doesn t look cheap. Very trustworthy on my canon rebel 
24357 4 Works as advertised. 
24358 0 These plastic &#34;filters&#34; I knew would be on the margins of uselessness, and I was not disappointed. They attach poorly to the camera, increase distortion and reduce light transmission, and don t really filter out the wavelengths that they are intended to filter. Don t waste your money. 
24359 4 An amazing lens that every camera owner should have. A great value because the price includes lots of extras. Speedy delivery, nicely packed. Thanks! 
24360 4 Great film, but I wish it was a bit cheaper for returning customers. 
24361 4 No issues does the job. 
24362 4 An excellent companion to the FZ-1000 
24363 4 Super light you can throw it on your shoulder and forget its even there. Not the most comfortable but is the most convenient. Would not recommend for sitting a long time. 
24364 4 Love it! This lightening has changed my professional look to the too of the list. My videos want be the same without it! Thanks :) 
24365 3 Very nice and comfortable sling bag. As described. Improvements could be a rain cover and a large pocket at the back to fit my iPod mini. I use my mini to review my pictures so it s always with me. 
24366 4 Closes tighter than my original gopro case. Works great with the cut out for my mic. 
24367 4 Great Great 
24368 3 just as described,,thanks 
24369 3 it works 
24370 4 Excellent oversize MagicFiber screen pack. Perfect for my huge laptop screen, multiple desktop monitors and also for our HD TV screen. Would gladly buy again from this seller! 
24371 4 Love this product. The camera and cable fits perfect. The directions were simple and installation was a breeze. I was concerned about the sound quality, but much to my surprise, it was outstanding. I love it so much I just ordered a second case. 
24372 3 I think that these batteries might be better than the Pentax originals. 
24373 4 Worked great for reversing the polarization of the lcd display on my motorcycle. Now it s black with white numbers. Looks awesome! 
24374 4 Excellent product with great service response from the vendor. 
24375 4 I used the head strap while climbing a mountain. I really got some great shots, allowing me capture the entire event seemlessly. 
24376 4 nice camera great price 
24377 4 Great camera especially for the price. Had lots of accessories with it too. Have been using for a few weeks and have not had any issues. Not sure why people would spend 10x s as much for the name brand version. 
24378 4 Quick response, product quality is excellent. 
24379 3 Good product. 
24380 4 I love this camera. very easy to operate. 
24381 4 This is awesome for teenagers and super simple to connect. I wish it would come with more paper. I have not priced how much it is to get extras but my teens loved this!!! 
24382 4 Fit was perfect and a great replacement to the original. 
24383 0 2 bulbs and 1 stand did not work. Very cheaply made. 
24384 4 Great and quality product. I have been using it for years now. 
24385 4 Item worked perfectly! Great pictures and video. 
24386 4 I dive very often and this filter system is extremely handy. The photo/videos are much more vibrant and having the option to switch to a different filter ensures your photos come out amazing. Two thumbs up and a 5 star from me. 
24387 3 Just wished there was an updated version of this with VR. Other than that it works fine. 
24388 4 Very smooth operation. For the price it is as good as it gets 
24389 4 This combination of two batteries and a charger was less than half the cost of one battery from a conventional store. 
24390 3 Very good products, but the floating handle is not completely sealed. On the last trip some water has entered inside it. 
24391 3 Not bad for the price 
24392 3 I have not flown it yet but all put together it feels very solid. I would rate five stars but there was no instructions and I had a little bit of difficulties putting g it together mostly my fault also there is no Allen wrench included which sucked. 
24393 4 VERY happy with this camcorder! The video and the stills come out clear. Amazing package for the price. Will recommend it to my entire Video class at school. 
24394 4 This bag fits everything I need it to fit. Very durable! 
24395 0 I had them for couple of month and started to fade. Not a good buy 
24396 3 Handy camera. Great Zoom ability. Its easy to switch from still to video. 
24397 4 i love my fuji camera and the film is easy enough to just drop in and shoot. 
24398 4 Arrived on time and worked well 
24399 4 Just as described - arrived on time and works perfectly. 
24400 4 more POWER MOAR POWUR 
24401 4 The carrier is well made, it holds the film flat with little loss of the image. 
24402 4 Works great! 
24403 4 Love, love, love! Cute and easy to use. Took a bit of practice to get used to the settings but I love the surprise on how the picture turns out. 
24404 4 It s a great solution to recharge Sony 7R batteries. 
24405 4 Love this for gopro....always have a batt ready! 
24406 4 I m so pleased with the camera and the speedily delivery! Great doing business with, I highly recommend! 
24407 4 i spoke with Danny today he was very helpful in explaining and setting up my camera i give hi 2 thumbs up tanks Danny 
24408 1 Good quality but don t stays in place, I bought this one for my iPad and I can t make that Stick on, poor quality adhesive. Disappointed!!! 
24409 4 i thebitems on time and was pleased. 
24410 4 Great camera! Excellent underwater photos. 
24411 4 Charged up great and have been using them with no difficulties! 
24412 4 The hood works great. Awesome lens hood, fits perfect and tight on the lens. I would recommend this hood. 
24413 4 Fits well! That s all you need really. 
24414 2 This is a decent remote. It just is really really small and feels kind of chintzy. But the price was right, so it ll do! 
24415 4 best half-case ever! grippy, lightweight, well-crafted! J.B. is the best...just when I thought the bamboo & walnut grips were great! 
24416 4 beautiful made and great results 
24417 2 Didn t love the results I had with this, but to be fair, I didn t test it out for very long before deciding I didn t want to keep it. 
24418 4 A+++++ 
24419 0 Not worth it. Daughter was excited to get it but after a few hours lost interest. 
24420 4 Perfect for our news show!!!! 
24421 0 does not fit! 
24422 4 Good quality and value. 
24423 4 So nice. All the items made the gift even bettwr 
24424 4 Batteries work great and saved a ot of money over the Canon brand. I am hoping the maintain their current change ability in the future too. 
24425 2 I have had issues with the stand in this set. The rest seems to be ok, but the stand keeps falling apart. Not high quality 
24426 4 Excellent APS-C sensor paired with a beautifully crafted 28mm (equiv) lens results in fantastic images. It s compact and unobtrusive. Perfect for street photography but it performed well on a cityscape sunset photoshoot. I d certainly recommend this product. 
24427 1 Very cheap. Broke on first use 
24428 3 Lasted about a year. Worked great in the meantime! 
24429 4 Excellent for sending power + video to remote cameras using cheap cat5e cable I got cheaply at a thrift store. 
24430 4 Perfect 
24431 4 Very good!!! 
24432 4 For a photography maniac comes in super handy. Charges fast. Has been in use for about 3 months now, and i charge them about once or twice a week. So far have not observed reduced battery lifetime. 
24433 4 GREAT PRODUCT 
24434 4 Excelentttttttttt 
24435 4 Use for protect my NX500 camera, looks amazing, pretty vintage and always at hand. Remember my grandpa s camera. 
24436 4 Great product 
24437 3 Have a Nikon D3300. Only received one of the two lens cap keepers, but even if I received the second one, probably wouldn t use it. Fell off rather quickly. Need better adhesive. Lens cap fit perfectly, and the HeroFiber cloths are amazing. 
24438 4 Outstanding Item and fast shipping. 
24439 4 doesnt hurt my neck at all 
24440 4 Great! 
24441 2 very hard to adjust 
24442 4 Gift for husband, he loves it! 
24443 4 Held like iron. Pleased. 
24444 4 These are great, hold two light stands, and other bits inside. The only thing I don t like about them is they take a couple I weeks to get them, but I have ordered them twice now. I think they are worth the wait. 
24445 4 Perfect 
24446 0 I bought this camera for vacation, I went threw 3 sets of batteries within 75 pics. The camera will not power off unless the batteries are removed. Not the best picture quality either. Keep shopping. 
24447 4 Had them now for two and half years and they are working great, they keep the charge capacity very good. 
24448 1 Sun shade is visible when not zoomed. 
24449 3 Sticky tape doesnt last. Otherwise the picture quality is great. Using it for USPSA shooting matches. Works awesome. 
24450 4 very happy with product 
24451 3 I like these cameras, they are doing their job. I already had 2 so I bought 2 more from amazon 
24452 4 Exactly like the one that came with our camera. Now we have a spare. 
24453 1 This only worked briefly before it just quit working. It was a cheap option I went with and ended up having to spend more money on another one. I should have not skimp on quality just to save money 
24454 3 It s great for nigh macro photography. 
24455 4 Nice cheap replacement to old camcorder had laying around 
24456 2 I didn t like not like this product very much. The material felt in-considerably cheap for the cost of the item., the album is very hard and stiff which makes it difficult to flip through the pages. Additionally, the pages after regular use start to detach. 
24457 4 Great batteries for the price 
24458 3 Just perfect! Thank you! Works great! 
24459 4 Fits and chatges perfectly 
24460 4 Used this for a wedding guest book alternative and the guests loved it! 
24461 3 Understanding the manual is not easy. 
24462 4 Works perfectly 
24463 0 Listed as a micro 4/3 adapter but when I revived the item, its for T2 adapter. 
24464 4 Can t be beat for the price, this is a professional grade monopod for the videographer on a budget with a very smooth pan & tilt...great product!!! 
24465 4 this works surprisingly well with my P520 camera. I m just mad i didn t buy it sooner. 
24466 4 Excellent quality, fast charger, they fit snugly but perfectly. 
24467 3 Quite expensive but works really well. 
24468 4 Awesome !!! 
24469 3 Small, but mighty. I carry it in my pocket when on excursions. 
24470 4 Really works well can t tell the difference 
24471 3 Excellent little camera but a bit difficult to program. Went online for help and found different opinions mostly negative to the programing. After many atemps, finally got it to work and I am happy with it. 
24472 4 Great service and product. 
24473 4 This was a purchase for myself and I have found it as advertised and a good purchase. The seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with. 
24474 4 Works very well & I would purchase again from this company. 
24475 1 don t try to recharge these with an auto charger cord or adapter plug! it will actually drain the battery. 
24476 2 After two years, still can t access remotely. One of the cameras went from color to black and white after a year. 
24477 4 I used it in the Caribbean and I m totally happy that I bought it... 
24478 3 Wasn t happy with the camera at all 
24479 4 Great! 
24480 4 Will return to seller. 
24481 4 Free charger and battery, what a deal, why buy &#34;GoPro&#34; when you can get same product for a fraction of the cost. 
24482 4 Quick delivery and excellent products 
24483 4 Simple design, easy to use, and saves me money. I had two different people ask me to look at it because both had lost their GoPro s in the surf and had to buy new cameras. 
24484 0 Not what you expect.....very cheap and honestly should have a recall!!!! How do I return this? 
24485 3 It s a good charger everything came in great. The car charger is awesome as well. Overall great product. I was a bit skeptical buying it but it met all my expectations 
24486 4 This lens hood fits perfectly on two lenses and seems to good provide good protection from stray light, preventing flare. Works great! 
24487 4 loved it.....specially the sensor....my guests enjoy it very much! 
24488 3 works great when you remember to take it with you. LOL 
24489 2 Works fine. 
24490 3 Works great for what it is. 
24491 1 I was excited to get but I was a little disappointed when I got it When I put my phone and hold it, it doesn t feel sturdy. It feels like it is missing something to hold it together. 
24492 4 Only got one like everyone else s review... and my roommate purchased these through my recommendation and she only got two.. But they sent me the 4 pack right away! 
24493 0 There are alternate option available for lesser price when you compare the quality of this product 
24494 4 My son s a photographer and he loved this product! 
24495 4 Awesome, better than what I could have imagined!!!! 
24496 0 Didn t work with my d3200 
24497 4 Thanks 
24498 4 Fits the camera all right, comfortable to use. 
24499 4 Love it 
24500 4 It was perfect ,arrived extremely late lol but product was new and I m happy with it. 
24501 4 Nice product, all is well 
24502 4 Bought for my little cousin. She loves it. Film can get expensive though. 
24503 0 It did not work at all 
24504 3 Smaller than I expected. Work great for a variety of projects. 
24505 4 great transaction. Product as described 
24506 4 Very hood 
24507 3 Bright, floaty, and easy to use. 
24508 4 For the price it is a great little camera. 
24509 3 Nice 
24510 4 This was a great price. Want to add more shooting time? This is a must have. This also adds stability when handling the camera. 
24511 4 Wearing glasses can be a curse, especially when dealing with the eye piece on a camera. The Hoodman has proven extremely useful in easing that issue and now that I have it, I m not sure how I did without it before. 
24512 4 Camera fits. Not much room for anything else. 
24513 4 Good 
24514 3 I really like this camera very much, shoots good pictures! 
24515 4 Easy to use for my first digital camera. Pictures I have taken are very nice with the effects I wanted. 
24516 0 It malfunctioned and I m actually trying to return it and get a refund 
24517 2 Good basic wifi ip camera, The down side, are the installation instructions, i had to use a third party IP Camera viewer to use. Not in English, 
24518 4 Took very good underwater pictures and videos! 
24519 3 ok 
24520 4 great 
24521 4 Awesome 
24522 2 Works well just tough if you don t have the proper TV. 
24523 4 Just have received this and it works just as advertised. Blue tooth connected quickly and my iPhone6 fit just right. 
24524 4 Have a Canon EOS T5. Fits pefectly. Holds all accessories plus some. 
24525 4 Made a fire in 15 seconds, first try right out of the box! The magnifying lens works great too! 
24526 4 This camera is fantastic, quick and small enough to carry all day casually, yet it has plenty of features for when you really want to dial in those amazing shots to remember. Works great for everything I ve thrown at it and has good battery life. 
24527 2 Bulkier than expected. Difficult to get focused. Researching the YouTube tricks to adjust the internal stuff adjusted 
24528 3 good 
24529 4 Excellent system. My husband bought it for a client, and he says it has excellent resolution! Unfortunately he couldn t test the remote viewing feature as the location where it was placed does not have internet option. But other than that, a very good system. 
24530 4 Works perfectly with my set up. Great deal! 
24531 4 Best small camera I ve used. And, it has an interchangeable lens!! 
24532 4 Good camera, be aware of sellers, some send Chinese version and there is no way to change OS 
24533 0 I bought 2. Nice resolution when working. My unit failed within 8 months. This is not an outdoor camera. 8 months later it failed due to water inside the camera. The one mounted indoor is still working. 
24534 4 Simple, works well, and nicely priced. 
24535 2 I purchased as a gift. Please don;t bug me again for a review. 
24536 4 very confortable and useful 
24537 4 I wanted a frame for my GoPro and saw this. For the price I thought it was a great deal. I wanted the frame for better sound quality as well. I am pleased with this frame and it holds my GoPro very well. A great product. 
24538 4 Bought this for my husband--he loves it-stilling learning with it-something new each nite. Very happy with it ! 
24539 4 Thanks so much all products are in good conditions 
24540 4 Had lights with pull string and what an improvement this has made, no more trying to find the string in the dark. Walk in and the light turns on and can adjust the time the light stays on with no motion. 
24541 0 Plastic d ring that the strap attaches to broke after a week when the bag dropped from my shoulder to the crook of my elbow...now I have no strap, and I drop my camera :( 
24542 4 Very good. Great price and value. Will Recommend. 
24543 3 Not super ultra precise and perfectly accurate, but they do the job and they are certainly affordable. 
24544 2 Great little camera for the dough, great video. Batteries do not last very long, however bought some spare. The case cracked at the hinges with very little stress, so I only give it 3 stars. The accessories are great. Not bad for the price. 
24545 4 Works great. car charger adapter a real plus!! 
24546 4 Good for any water goer! 
24547 3 The lenses are very snug and require a bit of force to get into the holder. Otherwise, they are really nice and I love the &#34;wallet&#34; holder. 
24548 4 INCREDIBLE Camera... best I have ever owned... exceptional in every way... as advertised... arrived on time... NO surprises... THANKS, J 
24549 4 Works fine! Great price! 
24550 4 I love it!! It is most definitely the best camera I ve ever owned. It is easy to use and takes great pictures. 
24551 4 They fit perfectly, work great, and don t take too long to charge. 
24552 3 Overall great material made. I don t have the original one but happy with this one. WORTH! 
24553 4 Vast improvement over the other ones I have tries. The eye shield stayed attached the whole day out in the field shooting. 
24554 4 I m looking for the same bag just a little bigger, it works well made very well. 
24555 4 Works Great! I highly recommend it if you need so see how the colors will will look in print before you print. 
24556 4 GIFT FOR MY 12 YEAR OLD. OF COURSE SHE LOVED IT...LOL 
24557 4 I use this as a kitty cam when I am traveling and it is by far the best investment I ve made. I love being able to check in on my babies when I am away. 
24558 4 very good 
24559 4 This is my son s first real camera and he loves it. He has taken some really fantastic shots. 
24560 3 Works good. A little loose on the swivel but it does the trick. 
24561 4 For the GP4, the back cover is useless, but everything else works excellently and fits perfectly. Don t even but a GP4 without this kit to protect the housing and lens glass elements - it s just not smart. 
24562 4 As expected which is nice 
24563 4 Great product for the money. The kit got me off to a good start and the lens works perfectly. The more I learn the more use I have for each of the items in the kit so it was a wise purchase. 
24564 4 Excellent! Thank you!! 
24565 1 Heavy, difficult to open but worst of all. the micro SD cards do not stay in the cut outs and fall out when the case is opened. The foam that should hold the cards is too hard and the cards &#34;wiggle&#34; out 
24566 4 Came with batteries, worked inside through the walls & outside from a distance. Simple on/off buttons. Great product, highly recommend. 
24567 4 Charged up quickly, lights stayed on for 6 hours which is what the maker of the lights specified. I m happy. 
24568 3 Stable as stable gets, but heavy as hell. Seriously it is extremely heavy. 
24569 4 great battery for go pro last long and has pretty affordable price 
24570 3 For the price I think it works great!!! 
24571 4 should be in everyones bag 
24572 4 This replacement for my camera worked just fine. 
24573 2 It s ok for the price I paid for. 
24574 4 Delivery and product were excellent! 
24575 2 The viewer needs to be on a direct 90 degree/ perpendicular angle to see the true image and color. From an angle the image appears washed out 
24576 4 Awesome addition to my boyfriends warehouse where he shoots and is constantly moving around!!! 
24577 3 gets stuck when trying to remove the lens from the body of my camera but does the job otherwise. 
24578 4 Thanks so much. Fast shipping and great product :) 
24579 2 Got this without looking closely. It s made from soft low quality plastic... was expecting fabric. Worried it will get brittle over time and crack. The Gels very in quality and thickness. Honestly it feels pretty cheap. 
24580 4 I love looking at clusters and this eyepiece is awesome. I use Celestron X-Cels and this eyepiece is a great addition for the money. Very good optics for the budget astronomer like me. 
24581 0 Did not fit our camera. 
24582 2 Met expectations. 
24583 4 Love it but the velrco is AGGRESSIVE. Protect your curly headed kids and poodles from it s grasp. 
24584 4 Fast and easy transaction. Camera set up very simple. Happy with purchase. 
24585 0 Says wireless but won t connect to it. 
24586 0 Dangerous design. Cam weight causes it to tangle in lines causing kite to lose control. 
24587 4 Was useful in looking at some old slides. 
24588 4 Have to take &#34;innards&#34; of eyepiece out if you want to maintain the original view in the viewfinder - not difficult to do 
24589 4 Very good optical properties, perfect fit. 
24590 0 Legs won t stay extended. Ball head works well, but there is really no point to the extendable legs if they can t be locked in place. I will return this product. 
24591 0 Cant even record in daylight. Need I say more... 
24592 4 Really great asset if you are attempting to use available light and the light isn t cooperating. re-direct and use for fill or to enhance exisiting light 
24593 4 good quality 
24594 4 I like that the cord has an adjustment button. Other camera floats are sort of one size. Works well for it s purpose. 
24595 2 Little disappointed in the frame the picture it s self is smaller than I realized it would be. Also didn t get the remote, only good thing the company refunded me because of that & let me keep the frame so I guess I did come out ahead. 
24596 2 The on button is hard to push to get it turned on, video is fine, thank god for its remote. 
24597 4 It does the job. enough said. 
24598 4 Good items! 
24599 3 Good product but too big for my needs. 
24600 4 Works better than the original battery and the charger is great 
24601 4 After having my IRIS a month I really needed it. This is a perfect with. You do need to remove the props. But probably a good idea anyway. 
24602 2 This lease is a macro lens, but it lacks vibration reduction, so clarity suffers for close ups unless you use a tripod. 
24603 4 Fits the Nikon very well 
24604 4 We bought this for our wedding for a our photo booth. Works great. Takes nice pictures. I love that you can save the photos to an SD card. Very impressed. Would recommend. 
24605 4 Excellent...! 
24606 3 So far, i ve only used it a couple of times, and it s very user friendly. Great product for me! 
24607 4 Excellent product, I used the filters easily and the results were as expected. I recommend it 100%. 
24608 4 My son likes this for his camera. 
24609 4 case#c6725292 Agent AR004611 Excellent Customer Service and very helpfull. Nice product, nice quality and easy to use. 
24610 4 nice light case 
24611 4 Works better than I ve expected. 
24612 3 Amazing Stand. It s very strong. 
24613 4 Exceeded my expectations, perfect lighting for streaming online. 
24614 4 Perfect for my camera! 
24615 0 I have only used them 2 times. And 1 transmitter doesn t work. And 1 receiver the connector piece broke off and my flash fell off into my softbox luckily that caught it. 
24616 4 Good Bag! 
24617 4 Worked great thanks. 
24618 4 Excellent camera, great shots, crisp and beautiful...worth the purchase 
24619 4 Works well world wide or at least in Europe. 
24620 4 Excellent, couldn t be more satisfied... 
24621 2 if you are beginner with filter I would recommend it, because is cheap. it gives cause glare and you see the rim of the plastic holder. 
24622 3 Good case 
24623 3 Works fine. A little cumbersome to take on and off, but this is minor. Be careful not to over-tighten. 
24624 4 Works great. 
24625 3 It could hold a charge longer but it s good enough. 
24626 4 Perfectly fits Nex5-R 
24627 4 This was for my daughter and she really enjoyed it. Shipped right away so I enjoyed that. 
24628 4 Fits my new Canon 50mm lens. Works great, Price was great. 
24629 4 I love this lens. The optical capability is phenomenal for the price. I use ti with my K-x. Its great for potraits, and just street photography. Even some scenery. I love Pentax! Thank you!!! 
24630 4 I love this. Easy to use and light weight 
24631 2 Its okay. Fun to fly once you get the proper trim because otherwise it has a mind of its own. Also, the camera SUCKS! its worse than stand definition so if i keep it, I absolutely must find a higher def (real HD) camera for this thing. 
24632 4 Very good 
24633 4 Great batteries for Fujifilm camera.... They last long... 
24634 4 The best! 
24635 0 Did not met my expectations... 
24636 4 Great and reliable strap 
24637 0 This is a replica it does not work, I ve downgraded over 300 ps3s amd this clip is giving errors no matter what. Do not buy it s is not authentic 
24638 4 Fit perfectly on my hd ghost. 
24639 2 It s a total piece of crap but it works as a minimal travel tripod to throw into a bag and jump on an airplane for a shoot. 
24640 4 Awesome product. Works great in wet, hot, dry, or cold climates. Would recommend this to anyone that has a Gopro. 
24641 4 Fit great, last longer than the original! 
24642 0 DISSAPOINTED!!!! Only after a few shots, the battery went dead. I had it replaced but then I was greeted only with a blank screen. A total waste of time and money !!!! DO NOT PURCHASE !!! I gave this a 1 star only because NO STARS is not an option. 
24643 4 Great product, great price. Shipping was quick and everything was as described, very high Quality. I bought them for my Anart and they are perfect! I would buy them again and certainly recommend them to anyone looking for a back up or replacement battery. 
24644 3 Great filter. It is larger than 82mm(the threads to lens are 82mm) on the top half which makes it impossible to use with lens hood. 
24645 4 Great Tripod--Can collapse or extend to a good lenth. 
24646 4 great 
24647 0 Unfortunately it was DOA, display didn t work and it would not program. The process for obtaining a replacement is smooth as silk. I hope that it works so I can rave about it. 
24648 4 Very good camera. Works great! 
24649 4 easy to install 
24650 4 The bag was perfect for my equipment. Plenty of room for my lenses and camera bodies. I even managed to squeeze in a Metz CL-1 flash and various other accessories. The strap for the tripod is a must for bike riders. Good quality bag with plenty of padding. 
24651 4 Excellent product, fast shipping. Buy without hesitation. 
24652 4 I couldn t stop reading. Loved the characters. This prompted a lot of discussion with friends. Totally recommend it. 
24653 4 Best thing ever i got for my flash. It work very good. Makes a difference!!!! Good material, you cant go wrong with this. 
24654 4 Great product and they perform exactly as expected. Much better than the permanently attached prop guards for ease of use with a carrying case. Comes with all the tools/parts needed to fit a variety of Phantom quadcopters as well. 
24655 4 Great value. Lens worked perfectly and nice extras 
24656 4 Great I didn t expect this kind tripod but I love it 
24657 0 The product description says that this is a &#34;Pre-made 125 foot RG59 and power cable&#34; Received and installed these only to find that is not RG59 as required by my security cameras. Laview says these are RG58 and they will not work. Buyer beware. 
24658 4 The battery has worked as advertised. 
24659 4 excelent 
24660 3 You cannot beat this lens as an end in itself, but if you attempt to stitch a pan at close range, you will discover some interesting distortion realities. Even long range shots will give interestingly distorted cloud formations without attempting any stitching. 
24661 3 Everything was as promised and the batteries are a life saver when traveling. I love the tripod it works better that trying to take selfies. 
24662 4 awesome. like this battery it s nice to have a spare 
24663 3 Decent quality for the price. Works well. Case fit perfectly onto my S4 (T-mobile). 
24664 3 Fit my A58 perfectly level comes in handy when not using tripod which has 2 levels. 
24665 4 Fits perfect on the new third generation 50mm STM 1.8 lens. Only difference is the price as this was about 25% the cost of the real Canon Lens hood. Camer neatly boxed with lens cleaning cloth. What a Deal!!!! 
24666 4 Light and durable 
24667 4 A must have for any lens! This keep me for loosing my lens cap. It was easy to stick it on the cap, no additional glue need. 
24668 4 Great price for a double item which solved me not having to find each one by its self. works great for what it was designed for. 
24669 4 good 
24670 4 Works well 
24671 4 Great price and perfect fit. 
24672 4 We love it! And we are ordering 2 more cameras. Night vision is perfect. 
24673 4 Wonderful keeps everything together. 
24674 3 great! 
24675 4 great products. Thanks 
24676 4 A good product. 
24677 4 Love this strap it was more of a blue than a green but still great 
24678 4 Love it! Takes beautiful pictures and is very easy to use. Small and lightweight. 
24679 0 I did order 2 of them..one for me and the other one as a gift..for my surprise my friend told me he got an empty box..with no pen inside..and was not able to replace it because it was after one month..and the box was outside US... 
24680 4 My original charger broke and I was luck to find this charger. It worked every bit as good as the original. I was very pleased in every way. 
24681 4 Works great with the app. The sound cuts in and out sometimes so it s hard to hear on the camera side. It might be when two people are watching it at the same time though. Pretty good quality to 
24682 4 This is a great camera. Could make due with a few advanced features, but I love it anyway :) 
24683 4 great product. helped immensely with my old slides. 
24684 4 Even brighter than I thought. Great deal. Thanks! 
24685 0 Not very good, it is loud and obnacious and it isn t very good quality. I DIDN T LIKE IT!! 
24686 3 Very nice lens. Used at sons baseball game standing at outfield fence 200 to 220 feet away. 
24687 4 Works GREAT 
24688 3 Works well 
24689 4 It s great thanks 
24690 4 Works great and easy to install. 
24691 4 Keeping my Nikon cameras powered on all my adventures! 
24692 4 I haven t got much use for it yet but I can see how it adds extra protection and would make it more visible if I were to ever drop the camera in the water, snow, etc. Good quality product. 
24693 4 great little camera, comes with all you need to use it. 
24694 0 Terrible. DO NOT BUY. Most do not even work. Pretty sure most of these reviews are not real. 
24695 4 The battery was exactly as described and arrived on-time in appropriate packaging. 
24696 3 Great strap for half the price of the black rabbit. I have used this on numbers of shoot and not have any issue with this strap. Stays in place all day even with a long lens on the camera. Again, can t beat the price. 
24697 4 The first really thin filter that lives up to expections. Recommended. 
24698 4 Actually used to give my pinhole USB webcam a wider field of view since clip held lens over it good. It also worked on my cell phone so I plan to get another. 
24699 4 Great product 
24700 4 These are too big for a back pocket but if I move lighting equipment I have them with me and they help a lot. 
24701 3 We ve had this product for 1 week. The charger and batteries work well. Only think that was a bit challenging was I really had to push to get the batteries to fit into the charger the first time. 
24702 4 Perfectly cute for a party or for photography props! They came with popsicle sticks to stick on to them which is way better than the small sticks that come with other paper photo props! Even came with chalk! 
24703 3 Battery inserts are a bit fumbly, but so far this device has performed great. As advertised. 
24704 4 Very good pictures and video quality. Price right for the product, very happy with the purchase. 
24705 3 So far so good.It took me less than 15minutes to get the camera up and streaming to my IPhone. The picture was crisp and colors were true. 
24706 3 I wish this was more robust, the top keep coming off when I use it.... 
24707 3 I have noticed no difference as far as I can tell at this point. I received them a week ago and have used them all this week shooting. Time will tell if they hold up. But the price is right! I have to say that. 
24708 4 Good batteries. I think they lose charge just a teensy bit faster than I d prefer, but they re good, solid products. 
24709 4 Perfect airline case for tripods, light stands, chargers, clothes, and umbrellas. Never gotten charged oversized either! 
24710 4 As advertised. 
24711 0 network browsing not possable due to ie 8 not supported unless you mak your computer less secure no updates avlaable 
24712 4 Perfect replacement for our dead mic at a great price. 
24713 4 This is the second on and still very happy, have purchased more to add to system. Good clarity and color. 
24714 4 Omg this lens is awesome I love taking nature pictures. I got it today couldn t wait to get it out of the box 
24715 3 I have used them for a year now & like it! 
24716 4 Excellent item for the cost 
24717 4 Works great 
24718 4 AS expected 
24719 4 Super versatile! Great product! 
24720 4 Came in the mail quickly and did not disappoint. 
24721 4 Fast service, product as described. Would do biz, again. 
24722 4 was a gift for a family member 
24723 4 Excellent product. Received the product faster than expected and the video and picture quality are great especially for the price. 
24724 4 Holds the GoPro just right 
24725 1 The bag is nice, but the top strap broke a few days after I started using it while on vacation. 
24726 1 They are what they are but the video quality isn t that great compared to my shorter cords. I thought my camera was going so I swapped it and same thing. 
24727 4 Very happy with it! Charges my nikon d3100 like a dream. 
24728 0 After 1 month of use, the anchor loop that the shoulder strap attaches to tore from the bag causing it to drop. Luckily none of my brand new gear was damaged. 5 starts to Amazon for processing my return and refund. 
24729 3 Can be difficult to use but definitely a great buy for the money. just takes some getting used to 
24730 4 loved the package deal 
24731 3 Compact lens and a must have addition for EOS M owners....makes the camera really portable. 
24732 4 Great set has everthing you need to keep your camera clean 
24733 3 The top is slightly crooked but maybe that s just me. Other than that it s really good. Especially for $15 
24734 3 Works as advertised. I installed most of them outdoors under my eaves and more than one year later all work just like new! 
24735 4 Great! Thank you very much....... 
24736 2 return 
24737 3 Quadcopter mount-- a bit heavey for flying--great photos--just under Mobius quality. 
24738 4 Gift for my granddaughter. She loved it! 
24739 4 It works well! 
24740 0 Neat idea, but this camera kept shutting itself off. That makes it useless. I contacted Polaroid, and they said that the problem was with the brand of SD card. That may be, but the camera should work with any card, especially a top name brand. 
24741 3 Liking this camera.... For the price I am impressed... 
24742 2 Getting shadow from this so still on the fence. maybe ill actually learn how to use it some day. lol 
24743 4 The picture quality is excellent, even with the night vision, FTP on wireless works very well too, love the camera and would like to recommend this to anyone. 
24744 4 Absolutely fell in love with the 6D the moment I had it in my hands. Just what I needed to enter into full frame. A great upgrade from the Canon Rebel Series. 
24745 4 Given as gift, recipient loved it. 
24746 4 Its a nice little lens, great under dark light but does not extend as far as I want that is why my 18-50 is probably what I will stick with. 
24747 4 I like it 
24748 0 It was the wrong charger. 
24749 4 NICE CAMERA WITH VERY CLEAR PICTURE. INSTALLED EASILY. GOOD LENSE FOR GENERAL &#34;AROUND THE HOUSE&#34; PLACEMENT. 
24750 4 Works great. 
24751 4 This kit has everything I need to have many options when using my go pro Hero 3 Silver 
24752 4 This set brought everything I need to introduce my students to electronics. 
24753 4 A birthday gift for my husband. He really enjoys the camera. Shipping was on time and in good shape. It was a very successful purchase. 
24754 0 Poor quality product, was broken when received. 
24755 4 Great product, it worked great! I recommend it highly! 
24756 3 It would be nice if the instructions made any sense. 
24757 4 Sensitive as it should be 
24758 4 Works great with my canon video camera 
24759 3 The bag was not the same as in the picture nor the ones previous buyers had. Besides that and the bag being a bit snug for my Canon, it is a good case. 
24760 4 Works great and shipped in a timely fashion! 
24761 4 We love the bag it is able to carry all the things for our camera. Shipping was awesome. 
24762 4 excellent 
24763 4 Much more durable than other third party eye cups! 
24764 4 Very efficient and they charge fast. Definitely a great comparison to the name brand of Canon. 
24765 0 I got to use it ONCE and it completely stopped working. Needless to say, I m a bit pissed about that. 
24766 1 The strap is neoprene. I have no confidence in it not wearing and breaking suddenly. I replaced it. 
24767 3 Cameras are useless without extra light at night. 
24768 4 Great little tripod. Even supports the weight of my Canon T5i with a large macro lens attached. Very handy for those quick shots that don t work well hand-held. 
24769 4 Battery came in fast and it works great. Ordered another one and that one works great. Would recommend the seller and the batteries. 
24770 4 Works well with the most Acra-Swiss mounts... nice compact design doesn t block battery door on most of my cameras. 
24771 4 This is an amazing camera bag. Its thick and durable. It has lots of compartments for your camera and lens. Great space for extra batteries and accessories. My fiancé loves it. well worth the extra few dollars. 
24772 4 Fits my camera perfectly. Very compact and high quality. I love the gray color! 
24773 4 Nice set 
24774 2 Can t get it to work. Long hours on the phone with D-link. It functions, but not as Dliink advertises. 
24775 4 Great replacement 
24776 4 Great lens! Takes nice sharp photos. It s a heavier lens so it takes some time to get used to. Using a tripod or upping the shutter speed will eliminate any camera shake. I use this lens more than I thought I would. Very happy with this purchase. 
24777 4 Worked awesome great extinsion for my rgbw led light strip. It s supposed to be for cameras but this power extinsion works like a charm for what I needed for great purchase 
24778 4 My old cord was giving me trouble this one seems real nice no trouble 
24779 4 Everything I wanted and more! Very good deal for the price. 
24780 0 I ve played with it a bit and I honestly can t say i notice a difference between my internal and external on my Mark II. I heard the Rode Video Mic Pro is the way to go if you want an honest good sound. 
24781 0 Did not work, gave my money away :( 
24782 4 Excellet 
24783 4 Great deal on this system. Very easy to set up and use. Very easy to set up the mobile app on iPhones. Just download the app and scan the QR code.... It instantly connects! Very helpful support forum on the Amcrest website. 
24784 4 Works perfect 
24785 4 A gift for my wife and she loves it. 
24786 4 ar004214 Great customer service, they walked me thru the set up and got everything working like it should. 
24787 4 Sick!!! 
24788 4 So happy with my new hard to find battery for my Nikon Cool Pix Camera! 
24789 4 If you have a gopro you need spare batteries. I ve used Wasabi for a hero3 and now for my hero4. I don t really notice any amazingly longer runtime, but they work and are dependable. Best part is the charger that comes with, very convenient 
24790 2 For the price they are fine, but they don t really fit exactly. If you are easy on them the work fairly ok 
24791 4 Super well made item. Great price! 
24792 2 just okay some lenses are usless 
24793 4 work great 
24794 4 Just as expected 
24795 4 Perfect! 
24796 3 Great Product will buy again. 
24797 4 All work perfectly with my new go pro hero 4. Every bit of kit feels nice and solid and well made. This would certainly meet the needs of most thrill seekers. 
24798 2 The bag holds my camera equipment but just did not expected to be so big 
24799 4 Good price fast delivery 
24800 4 Great piece of equipment, well built and filters as it should. 
24801 4 Nice product! Great for hiking. Just attach to bag while you hike and charge your batteries. I would recommend it to anyone. 
24802 4 NEEDED SUPPLIES 
24803 4 Got this camera for my son who is studying photojournalism. He loves this camera. 
24804 1 Seems way less than 52. 
24805 4 I am always pleased with the Sigma filters. 
24806 3 Worked as expected, easy to install. 
24807 4 Perfect! Hold flash, diffusion dome, spare batteries and has a belt loop. Nice, solid, sturdy durable fabric. Expect to use it for years to come bgs. 
24808 2 very convenient in certain situations. 
24809 4 I purchased two of these and bought a third one today! Great product. 
24810 3 Good product, delivery on times, I like it ! 
24811 0 broke after 3 months and i can t find a warranty 
24812 4 This was my first reflector purchase and it looks just like the picture. I don t think the material is flimsy, but I am not hard on equipment either. 
24813 4 This is a very nice storage case. I would repurchase again. 
24814 4 Came rapidly and on-time. Exactly as advertised. I am impressed with the instruction material that came with it. There is little else that you might want to head out prospecting. 
24815 4 Perfect as shown, thank you. 
24816 4 tks 
24817 4 A+ great doing business with you. Great product. 
24818 4 worked great on raining days in canada 
24819 0 Advertised as wireless, but only works when hard wired to the other speaker....useless. I returned it. 
24820 4 as expected 
24821 2 Not very good quality batteries. Don t hold near as good a charge as name brand batteries. 
24822 4 For the a7rII. Fits perfectly. No compatibility errors with the battery. Both battery icons appear on top right corner. Looks and feels like the camera body and grip. All custom buttons, wheel, and AF/MF buttons function correctly. Meike Battery Pack. $340 cheaper than original. 
24823 3 Service was great, arrived on time but after a day of use it broke, it could ve been that I was over using it but my advice is just be careful with it 
24824 4 These little pieces make a big difference, great experience from seller! 
24825 4 Great product and good price 
24826 0 i can t get the thing to record. some how when i got it to work it won t play on my computer. i find it junk. 
24827 4 Thank you 
24828 4 Easy to install. Easy to use. Great pics! Will buy another. 
24829 4 It works so well, I love this. 
24830 4 I LOVE this lens! Not great in low light without a tripod because there s no stabilizer for shake but if you re outside, it s great for the price! 
24831 4 Great stand sets up quickly, and supports large modifiers well. If weight is a consideration, this beast is heavy. 
24832 4 Great price and fast shipping. Works fine with my Nikon D3200. 
24833 4 Great for party use you don t have to be a professional to use. Takes excellent pics with little effort. 
24834 4 Very NICE 
24835 4 This film is beautiful and I could not be happier with it! 
24836 4 Loves that it doesn t twist once the gopro is attached 
24837 4 A++++++++ 
24838 3 Good 
24839 2 probably just wasted money on this. 
24840 2 Had to tighten spring clip to hold wire in! 
24841 4 Very easy to use and clear. 
24842 3 Perfect was what i need 
24843 3 Love the camera works great outdoors. Love the WFI to send pictures to my tablet or computer. 
24844 3 Works great but sometimes freezes and has to be restarted - great value for money! 
24845 4 works great ,fast shipping 
24846 0 Didn t even work... WTF 
24847 1 Not as useful as I thought it was going to be. 
24848 2 It s good to have these for Cloud functionality. However, I thought this can be used as a NAS. It s basically a personal cloud storage if you re trying to find one. 
24849 4 Good battery at a good price 
24850 4 Holds up just like the one that came with my D5300! 
24851 2 turn nob past first click to switch on, but the light only comes on when turn 1/3 of the way on. so the range is only 2/3. 
24852 4 Got for my Canon Rebel T3i. Works great!! Great price as well! 
24853 0 Even when moving the lens around to optimal placing over the camera, the photo quality is terrible. 
24854 3 I bought a 7mm one and find myself using my 32mm omni much more, go figure. Eye relief is better than regular omni plossl eps at the shorter focal lengths.but it is quite large and heavy, be ready to rescue and rebalance your rig if needed. 
24855 4 Perfect, exactly as described. 
24856 4 Good. Does the job 
24857 0 POS, will not even show up when plugged into computer. Garbage 
24858 4 Super incroyable 
24859 4 Nice one I use it for birding to get easier focus in which part in suspect i want 
24860 4 Gives me the extra battery life I need when using my GoPro while traveling. I also love all the adapters and the car charger. I travel internationally frequently and this gives me the ability to take my GoPro anywhere. Thanks, Wasabi! 
24861 4 Works great and Good price 
24862 0 Mine worked fine for two years and then out of the blue they both quit. Will not reset or connect to wifi anymore. Philips tech support couldn t do a thing. 
24863 4 Excellent quality and super fast shipping! 
24864 4 one of teh best thing i ever got!! 
24865 4 Very Good 
24866 4 It se a grate camera!! 
24867 3 The lens lid barely fits with the filter on, so I have to be really careful not to lose the lid. 
24868 4 Great replacement and very affordable 
24869 4 Love the camera! 
24870 3 Like the frame picture display and thickness (so thin). Still work OK except once a while it shutdown by itself and I cannot turn it on except unplug and plug in again. Like the motion sensor and USB flash drive support. 
24871 0 This is not made of leather! 
24872 4 Good product for the $$ 
24873 4 as advertised 
24874 4 convenient product for system setup 
24875 4 Love this purchase! heavy duty tripod, is perfect 
24876 2 The housing feels weak and I have to constantly adjust specially on roller coasters. 
24877 2 These batteries seem to last about 2/3 s of the time the original camera battery does. 
24878 4 good stuff saves lots of time 
24879 3 Very Nice piece of equipment. Although refurbished it works as new. 
24880 3 very nice telescope but if you are not gonna leave it put together somewhere, setting up can be a pain. 
24881 3 Nice camera. Did need some Tech Support to get my remote set up. Vincent at Foscam Tech Support is AWESOME! He definitely knows what he is doing! 
24882 4 Good range, good picture. For the price the was a pretty good setup 
24883 4 It s a good protector for the lens, I use the camara for motocycle ride ando for car racing, so it is indispensable to protect your lens.it s crystal clear. 
24884 4 This is amazing I love the one of the best purchases I have made in a while! 
24885 4 Just as shown 
24886 3 Camera was very easy to set up. The image is clear. Features operate great. I now have 5 of there. The only drawback is that my computer slows down to a crawl when I have all 5 cameras up and running. Otherwise they nice and give me peace of mind. 
24887 4 This one is OK 
24888 4 As advertised. 
24889 4 Love this case. I bought it to carry my Panasonic Lumix FZ200. It fits perfectly, and I love the side compartment s. They fit an extra battery and memory card. 
24890 4 It s awesome. 
24891 4 Great quality quick shipping! 
24892 1 It s not so steady. Head strap and chest belt both. 
24893 3 Received it and works so far 
24894 4 Awesome. I use with BlueIris via wireless connection and get perfect video with no packet loss. (4000K, CBR, 20fps, 2048x1536, audio) Lot s of features for the money. These can hidden fairly easily into various nick-nacks around the home. 
24895 2 good 
24896 4 arrived before shipping estimate. good product 
24897 4 Nice lens! 
24898 4 Great 
24899 4 exactly what I needed. 
24900 4 I love this camera so much. I was a little worried when I ordered it cause there isn t any reviews but im glade I did cause its an amazing camera! you can take action pictures and they turn out great I love it! 
24901 0 Camera do not match photo. IR leds are not black like they are in photo. they are white. quality was bad. cheap joints and felt very poorly made. 
24902 2 I ve only used several of the accessories but they seem to perform reasonably well. 
24903 4 Got this thing for my hero3+ and was not disappointed. I really love the locking feature and the color makes it pop. Pretty sturdy for a gopole. Price is reasonable too 
24904 4 Product arrived promptly and exactly as described. 
24905 4 Works great 
24906 3 The batteries last as long as the original battery. I have found that having 3 batteries is plenty for most recordings. This gives you 3 hours of recording time with the Go Pro Hero Silver. 
24907 1 The stick itself is ok, but after a few uses during diving, appropriately cleaning it of saltwater and letting it dry, it s so rusted at the pole extension points and the screw that it leaves rust all over my hands, and is almost impossible to extend out now. 
24908 4 They work great with the Canon EOS Rebel camera 
24909 4 best idea ever 
24910 1 Not good, lens didn t focus well, most times it will go back and forth without focusing. When it did focus the pictures where ok, not great. The motor is slow and left me not impressed. 
24911 4 Purchased as a gift for a talented young photographer. No complaints from recipient. Request for IS lens important to him for taking video captures with unit. Canon or Nikon. Lexus or Infinity. Same argument. I have been a Canon user since 1972. 
24912 0 WORKED GOOD FOR 2 WEEKS 
24913 4 GREAT PRICE, GOT IT FAST! 
24914 4 Worked as advertised. Saved $. 
24915 0 Pros: Roomy, room to fit mroe than 1 tripod. Cons: Zipper broke after a year. Rating of 1 star because with a broken zipper its basically useless Would NOT recommend based on my experience.. 
24916 1 poorly made, first 2 broke when putting on lens 
24917 1 Fast Shipping but Zmodo is bad quality :( 
24918 3 Good in low light conditions. Nikon still needs to improve the lense covers. 
24919 4 Wonderful!Great quality! 
24920 4 THE best camera for vlogging. The wide angle (although fisheye) is very good quality and has many options when it comes to filming. The best part about this though is the AUDIO. Perfect sound 100% of the time, it is crazy how well the microphones work. 
24921 0 very nice way to view your photos.but the adaptor needs to be replace.it will stop the photo slide,the clock will also stop running.,the frame is very nice with a nice matting. 
24922 3 The RX 100 CAMERA is excellent. Some of the items that would come with the camera were missing (tripod), I have received 3 batteries instead of one, and a kit for cleaning the lenses that was not listed in the package I have bought. 
24923 3 good 
24924 4 great for photography back up. 
24925 0 This didn t work for me. The corners of the photo was shaded. Destroyed use of pictures. Be forewarned. 
24926 0 Glare... useless! 
24927 3 The battery can be overcharged? If you charge longer than 1 hour at 15 minutes, it seems to burn up the battery. 
24928 4 great gift! 
24929 4 I really like the timer and the resolution was so good, I ordered an extra pair. 
24930 3 a bit thin .. 
24931 4 great 
24932 0 First time out of the box...lines through the screen. SO disappointed with this product. 
24933 3 does the intended job, however would have been better if came with the actual bolt/screw so not having to swap out everything when needing to swap out 
24934 1 Flimsy. Can t hold my camera. 
24935 4 No problems 
24936 4 fits my camaer and woks as expected 
24937 3 A gift- but much appreciated. 
24938 4 Does what it s supposed to go, however if you take your Micro SD card and plug it straight to your laptop it makes transferring photos a lot quicker than just plugin the camera to your PC via usb. 
24939 3 i received with good condition and I m surprised because I find extra flash with it .....thank you 
24940 4 for a bearing slider at this price you can t complain. holds well, little bit of a drag on heavier cameras but overall great buy! 
24941 4 Works well, easy to install, kept track of home and horses while on vacation. Great to have peace of mind while not at home!! 
24942 0 Readout of battery levels different from camera screen indication. 2nd battery stop charging and become unrecognised after a while. 
24943 4 This is about the 4th or 5th one I have purchased. I love the price and it s the only camera I can find with an actual view finder for those sunny days when you can t see diddly on the screen. 
24944 0 Camera looked NIB but would not power on. I have ordered this twice and had the same problem with both. The first one worked for 10 minutes and then never again. Not the camera for me. 
24945 2 Its has little pouches on the inside for extra SD cards or at least 50$ in singles with out bothering the camera or making it difficult to close 
24946 4 Good product!!! It is working good, I m going to continue using it for a few weeks, so I ll can do an interensting review 
24947 4 These worked great 
24948 3 Great camera. Lots of features. One thing to remember: You only use the provided hardwired Ethernet cable to hook to your modem in order to setup the camera and then you disconnect it for wireless capability. Can be placed anywhere. Needs electrical outlet. Works great with android Samsung S5. 
24949 4 Nice tight fit. 
24950 4 Wish you could take off the strap. Otherwise works great. 
24951 1 Exactly a replacement for my old one. Delivered in 4 days, Excellent 5 Star 
24952 3 Easy to install, an happy with this purchase 
24953 1 I DO NOT KNOW WHO TO USE THAT ITEM meca1456@netzero.com THANK 
24954 4 Bought this to full my 8 ch Sannce DVR and work great 
24955 4 great product 
24956 4 AAA 
24957 4 Works well 
24958 0 This product is pure garbage. Would not work for me on android app or windows desktop app. Instructions are in broken English and the windows desktop app set off Korean language warnings from my firewall. I recommend not purchasing this. 
24959 0 Junk item! Didn t work, had to get Amazon involved before anything was done about it 
24960 4 Used them several times on the standard camera tripod mounting screw. Works well and I expect they will last a lifetime. 
24961 3 Very useful. 
24962 4 Works great, with the A6000 
24963 4 This is great! I found a YouTube video to show me how to set it up because it doesn t come with clear instructions, but it s a great product. 
24964 4 good value 
24965 3 Would have preferred a slightly larger interior. only holds one lens. But does hold all other gear - extra memory cards and batteries. 
24966 4 Great quality, mounts on tripod with tripod adaptor for ease of viewing distant objects or the stars and planets. 
24967 2 So far only 2 of the batteries hold a charge. Will update later. 
24968 4 worked great 
24969 4 Holds up well , good usage 
24970 4 Fits the camera well. Not much room for extras. Maybe an extra battery and memory card. Should pack well and protect camera. 
24971 2 Not a L series that s for sure... 
24972 4 Really great little mount for 3m roku projector. Durable and flexible, I only wish it were slightly longer legged. 
24973 4 I bought this remote for my GoPro Hero4 and it works great! Lost connectivity under water if you are more than a foot or so away from the camera but otherwise it was awesome! 
24974 0 Item start up the first time and would not start since. Have to return for repair/replacement. For the price, it should have this kind of of problems. Does not recommend until problem is solved. 
24975 3 The only problem I ve had is you can t get everything back in the case. Everything else has been great. 
24976 4 great tripod!! I highly recommend it!! 
24977 0 Both tripods broke, remote does not work, HDMI cord would not work, camera bag is big enough for the camera itself (no lens included) and batteries each lasted a good 45 minutes. 
24978 4 good 
24979 4 Awesome Attachment to my DSLR 
24980 4 This item is exactly what I wanted. 
24981 4 Took them to Yellowstone and loved them. Looking forward to using them this fall in the woods. 
24982 4 Everything you need is in this pack 
24983 2 Im ok with perfomance not as clear as I would exspect but they do work good. 
24984 3 This item was just what I was looking for. 
24985 4 Construction is a bit flimsy but for the price...WELL WORTH IT! 
24986 4 superb product. as described and perfect fit. 
24987 4 installed without a hitch. video segments for each system part is clear. appears to be a great system for the price. 
24988 4 As expected and loving it! Due to the padding you may run out of room if your using it as a camera/laptop bag. 
24989 4 works great 
24990 4 This is GREAT! Great Battery and I LOVE it has 12v USA Household Plug and has a Car Charger Built-In Option too! High Quality! 
24991 4 Fantastic! I love that this is mechanical and I don t have to worry about yet another battery running out. 
24992 3 good, 
24993 4 Everything I wanted. Great product for the price. 
24994 3 Worked as well as original Canon battery. Holds charge for a shorter time, but was expected and was long enough to not cause any problem. Worth the price. 
24995 0 More faded looking in person Top picture was taken without flash on an overcast day Book was taken with flash inside. Also was my first picture taken. Would like to know if I m doing anything wrong A real waste of money. was not happy with this product 
24996 4 Really well made and charges my batteries very fast. Had to have a second charger for the road when taking a lot of pictures and need batteries fully charged over a short time. 
24997 4 No complaints. 
24998 4 Kenneth at Foscam was very helpful in setting up my camera. He set it up via remote access in just a few minutes. very pleased with their support. 
24999 4 Perfect replacements for the battery that came with my camcorder. Could not ask for better. 
25000 4 So good 
25001 4 It was perfect, I did 3 weeks in Europe and I loved this bag every minute I used it. It held everything I could carry from passports to wallet to cameras and there was plenty of space for extra things. 
25002 4 They seem to work fine. They come in a nice box. Great Buy 
25003 3 Wonderful flash for the money. Serves my purposes perfectly. 
25004 4 Excellent but you may need a fitting/bushing so check the specs 
25005 4 LOVE this lnes! Amazing effects, wonderful quality & clarity, such a great range and extremely affordable compared to the Nikon 300MM 
25006 4 Love the strap. Comfortable and much longer than one that comes with the camera. 
25007 4 Works great with my copper river cleaning swabs! 
25008 4 ordered it august 10th and received it 3 days later. the shipping was obviously very fast. i love this camera so so much. i bought the used one and it is in amazing. the camera looks like its new. i just love this camera! 
25009 4 Nice package, needed battery for a camera. Ordered it since cheaper than batteries alone, happily surprised to find a charger that runs on 110v and 12v Even freebie minitripod and kens cleaning kit. All very practical and welcome. Batteries work as well as factory batteries. 
25010 4 Works great! 
25011 4 Received the filter as described and promptly. Fits perfectly and is good quality. 
25012 4 Delivered on time. Perfect fit for camera and lens. 
25013 4 It s sturdy, good quality and how it floats in both fresh and salt water makes all the difference. 
25014 3 Great light for the price! Super bright! 
25015 2 small, can not fit 2 full frame camera with L lens 
25016 4 Got these as spares. Can t be happier! 
25017 3 Works well, great price. I m pleased. 
25018 4 I like it very much. 
25019 4 Can t beat it for the price. It works and setup is quick and easy. 
25020 2 Works good! 
25021 4 delivered as promised. great condition 
25022 4 This strap helps carrying the weight of my camera. Having it hang as a cross body is much more comfortable. Great idea!! 
25023 4 This camera is for my granddaughter & she loves it. It arrived promptly & it is just as advertised. The picture quality is great under water &. Well worth the price. 
25024 0 Hate it...threw it in the trash, actually. It kept falling off and I was gonna lose it anyways. Save your bucks for one made by Cannon. 
25025 4 Works like a charm!!!! 
25026 4 Met my expectations fro protection of the camera body. The flash rail protection flap doesn t seem to stay on but other than that it fit well. 
25027 1 didn t fit my camera! 
25028 4 Great fit 
25029 4 For working on a studio, it make sense to have it connected. However, when working on portraits, it would turn cumbersome. I would recommend it for product photo. 
25030 0 I ordered a T-ring to Micro 4/3 adapter. One side is T-ring, but the other side is NOT Micro 4/3. It s for some other lens mount but it isn t labeled so I don t know what mount it actually is for. Definitely not Micro 4/3 though. 
25031 4 Very good 
25032 0 This lens cap was attached by a stick on button which can easily be dislodged. 
25033 2 The case is nice but it arrived smelling terrible, like it had been in a damp basement for many years. I was able to watch some of the smell out but I will probably just throw it out at this point. 
25034 0 Not nothing like you say it was. 
25035 0 The case is not a convenient way to store the GoPro and all its accessories. It is not versatile enough to allow everything to fit in an easily accessible fashion. 
25036 4 Good item 
25037 4 This product is perfectly suitable for a GoPro HERO 3+ Silver Edition which I own. It fits all of my accessories which include: a selfie stick, chest mount, head mount, charging cable, teather, surfing mounts, and other small accessories. 
25038 4 Great, no lag, you can see what you are capturing. 
25039 3 Took it with me on vacation and it was very easy to handle ....light weight....and kept my camera in good condition 
25040 4 Works well as aa standby battery.. 
25041 3 Have not figured out all the buttons yet but seems to be working well. My photos are very nice. 
25042 4 The picture is crystal clear and couldn t have asked for more. Great quality. 
25043 4 This is cool little camera 
25044 3 Great system for the price. I wish the zoom function was better. The over all picture is not the greatest but it will do. 
25045 0 Works once in a while 
25046 2 One of the camera is out of service 
25047 2 It wasn t as easy to set up as I thought. But, seems to take good pictures in the Easy Mode. 
25048 1 too complicated, it is a 2 piece lens hood 
25049 4 I was so excited that this was the exact cable I needed to download my pictures. It came quickly and was very reasonable. 
25050 3 Cameras work great. Would have been 5 stars but one of the power cords was defective. Had to contact company through Amazon. They did mail a new power cord so now all three cameras operational. Been using for about three weeks, no problems, very pleased with picture quality. 
25051 0 I got one of these ! It s only lasted one year before the DVR stopped working So I m going to return it and see if they will replace it ! I will change my review if they replace it! 
25052 0 No charger and no battery came with the item I order. 
25053 0 Not happy that I got it and it s broken - seriously needed it for holiday and I m leaving the next day !!!! 
25054 3 Makes the grip on the X100s far more secure and comfortable. I feel like I am using a Leica again! Stays permanently mounted on my camera as I don t use an external flash or other things in the hotshoe. For me it is a must-have for this style camera. 
25055 2 Ok not very practical 
25056 0 Not a good product. I sent it back 
25057 4 Very well price for the unit. Thanks. 
25058 4 Great set at good price 
25059 2 Somewhat difficult to access software, and difficult to find setting to NOT automatically &#34;share&#34; your pictures with all online applications upon download. Still have not figured out how to find the auto-focus setting. 
25060 3 This is a great camera for the price. Almost endless possibilities. 
25061 4 Just like the Orig. canon cap 
25062 4 Works great. 
25063 3 This is my go-to strap! The clip that came with it ended up breaking but I purchased a swivel to attach to my body and it works great. Have used this one for years. Highly recommend. 
25064 4 This hard case is well protected my Instax printer. Like it. 
25065 4 So far so good after a couple charges 
25066 4 Thoroughly pleased with the binoculars. Equally happy that I got them at a great price! 
25067 4 Very good item. 
25068 4 Fits our new little camera perfectly! My husband carries it on his belt. Very convenient! 
25069 4 Must have! Great addition and easy to install. 
25070 4 Battery works great with my Lumix G6. Similar performance to original branded battery. Fast charging also. Great Product so far. 
25071 4 Very good product. Had to wait a couple weeks and they came from So. Ca. I m just upstate. 
25072 1 captures motion only occasionally. 
25073 4 Adorable well packed great books included to give advice can t wait to use it 
25074 4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jha2Vzh7oU Have a look see These pages are so inspirational they have motivated me to write so many new songs and create many new videos which I post on Youtube I m only sorry you don t have a larger selection. 
25075 2 It is what it is 
25076 3 works ok but too much surface area for wearing on top of motorcycle helmet. It pushes the head back at anything over 65 mph. 
25077 4 Old school - solid made, great price. Worked on my Novation kit perfectly. 
25078 1 Its almost two weeks and I still do not have it working..directions are terrible 
25079 4 It works, so I can keep using my old nikon. 
25080 4 Very well designed and durable construction. 
25081 3 Easy to use wth lossless image quality. Trying to adjust features is difficult so I d recommend shooting in AV or Shutter priority. I d recommend for those that are looking to shoot underwater without breaking the bank. 
25082 3 The digital photos look great. Initially I had a remote control that did not work. I notified Aluratek and they sent a replacement remote control right away and now it works great. Not a bad photo frame for the money. Looking forward to adding more recent vacation photos. 
25083 4 WORKS LIKE A CHARM. When on vacation, I keep an extra battery in my bag and has come in handy. 
25084 4 Great thanks 
25085 4 Exactly what was needed - thank you 
25086 4 Fits perfectly at a reasonable price, recommended. 
25087 4 great replacement 
25088 4 Works as advertised. May not be quite the quality of the real thing, but for the $$$ it works good. 
25089 3 Haven t used yet, but looking forward to it. Makes setup a lot easier. 
25090 3 I would give 5 stars if it had blue tooth. Very nice camera for the price. 
25091 4 Works well. No problems. 
25092 3 I needed this for a baby monitor. It seems to stay put on the crib well and is easy to use. My only complaint is the top part with the screw moves around, making it hard to stay in place. It works fine overall for my use. 
25093 4 fits exactly on my canon s110 makes a good job 
25094 3 I Like it. 
25095 4 Works greeat 
25096 4 They are all great. 
25097 4 I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! SEND ME MORE HOLY CRAP IT WORKS GREAT! I STARTED MAKING VLOGS AND THIS CAMERA WORKS GREAT FOR IT 
25098 4 It is exactly as described. I would deal with this supplier again 
25099 3 i just received this is in the mail, so far testing it and playing with the camera it looks to be in good condition. it looks nice and neat. i haven t tested with film yet. when i do, I ll edit this review. 
25100 4 great quality! 
25101 4 I got my camera super fast. It s in awesome shape and does take nice pics. I haven t really used it very much yet. I just ordered an sd card so I ll be using it more and I m sure will have great things to say. 
25102 3 We love the picture. The only thing which is different from what I read from the reviews was that the flash needs be manually instead of manually activated. 
25103 0 My camera arrived without a sad card. Your product information did not specify that I had to supply one. Stephen K. 
25104 4 I have been purchasing Lexerd screen protectors for my various cameras over the years and did so again recently for my new Canon PowerShot G16. Once again, the screen protector applied easily and served me well. I highly recommend Lexerd. 
25105 4 exactly what i needed. very happy with the purchase. thank you! 
25106 4 Very nice LED variable intensity light for tabletop, video and many other uses-runs very cool. If brand name would cost much more. 
25107 4 Ordered this for a birthday gift and it was perfect!!! Fun to be able to take pictures and share them too!!! My granddaughter loved it!!!! 
25108 4 Works great with the Manfrotto MK055XPRO3-3W! 
25109 3 Well built. 
25110 3 Awesome! however It would be better if I could host the images on my own website rather than having to share through facebook that then links to Ricoh website. 
25111 0 Very expensive, the material is fragil and one leg was stuck. I really expected more for this price. 
25112 3 Simple, but roomy and usable, especially for the price. 
25113 4 Had trouble with Motion Detection setup. Quick call and with remote connect, Walter had me going in no time..GREAT product and support.! 
25114 2 Don t trust this on the outside of a moving vehicle. I had it set up on the inside of my windshield and the suction cup falls off even during normal driving conditions. 
25115 4 Great deal. I ll never run out of batteries. 
25116 2 wish I had researched a little more and got the next level up. no user friendly when it comes to moving videos to computer. 
25117 0 It gives you a web site that throws you off you CAN NOT connect. The instructions a joke. you pull the company up on the web everything is in Chinese, I will never order from ELEC again. 
25118 4 Works awesome, charges fast and the best part is I can charge my batteries in the truck and in my camper when we area camping. Love it! 
25119 3 Used tis to mount my KK2 board on. Works great for ante-vibe 
25120 0 Tripod I received is not the one pictured 
25121 3 Nice little point and shoot. Some buttons on the small side but once you find them it takes great pics! 
25122 1 Was broken when i got it. Cannot control setting. Wheel was missing 
25123 4 wrong size 
25124 4 Great product. Worked exactly as described. The video is very good, also tech support is very good and helpful. Picture quality is great even at night. I can view the live screen on my iPhone/iPad with 4G network when I m away from home where no WiFi is available. 
25125 4 The PZ0420M camera is lighter and smaller than the more prevelant 32mm board cameras. Quality is excellent and RunCam/SecurityCamera2000 supports it well. Camera is very durable used on a 250 racing quad that crashes frequently. 
25126 4 I LOVE IT 
25127 0 Item does not work at all. Came with no directions. Complete junk 
25128 4 Item came as promised and contains a number of useful items. I would buy from seller again. 
25129 0 Camera will not work for more than 24 hours without needing a power cycle 
25130 4 Love it!!, really big props!! 
25131 4 Perfect for my needs as a wedding cinematographer, it s a shame Sigma company don t make them anymore for Nikon. I was very lucky to find it here on Amazon. 
25132 4 I love this product very easy to use. I reached out to tech support and spoke to Walter who was very helpful setting up the camera 
25133 3 Great product! Light weight and durable. Love the water proof carrying bag! 
25134 3 Works great with real Gopro however it is advertised to fit the DBPOWER camera and the batteries are not the same. No sweat off of my back as I returned that piece of junk and got the real thing! 
25135 4 Favorite camera 
25136 0 Could not program the alarm had no instructions to program it 
25137 4 This lens is a beast. Plus it came two days before expected. 
25138 4 It performs as advertised and as expected. 
25139 0 WHY DID I WASTE MY TIME, YOU CAN SEE BETTER WITH THE MOON LIGHT ALONE ! 
25140 4 Great lens. 
25141 4 great value and excellent product 
25142 4 Love it. 
25143 3 Seems to be overpriced for what you get, but it works quite well. However, it will not remove some stubborn dust particles. Also, you may need to use it a number of times before the sensor is clear of dust. 
25144 4 Great add to my lighting setup 
25145 4 Great buy for the money. 
25146 4 These are excellent devices. I mounted my cameras and now I feel quite secure because I can see 180 degrees around the place. 
25147 4 exactly what i needed 
25148 0 not 2000w and terrible to put together and put away. 
25149 1 Small for sony alpha a6000 + lens 
25150 4 PERFECT, just what the parents wanted….bought for a baby shower 
25151 1 This does not work. It was an unfortunate buy, and I was too lazy to return it. Bye-bye money. 
25152 4 great price. Primary batter ran low at the OC Fair.... could have been a nightmare but having two addition battery let me enjoy the cutting. 
25153 2 Worked well should ve gone bigger 
25154 4 LOVE LOVE LOVE they work great!!!!!!!!!!! 
25155 4 After ordering it I found my original charger and the new one is of the same quality if not better! I now have a spare! ( always good to have on hand...) 
25156 0 Didn t work the minute it was plugged in... crap product. 
25157 4 works great i will be getting more for my other cases 
25158 4 haven t use it yet but yes, its a good buy 
25159 4 It works well, the image quality is good, and the night vision is super.I love this camera. 
25160 1 Worked intermittingly. 
25161 4 It is a nice carry case but I have no use for it now. 
25162 4 Excelente. 
25163 4 Shoots very great images, no problem thus far. 
25164 4 Perfect size to fit spare batteries, charger, cables and a few small accessories for a quick on the go shoot. Good quality, will buy more of these products when needed. Highly recommended for the great price. 
25165 0 It never worked. 
25166 1 Poor quality pictures most were blurry and didn t come anywhere close to the beautiful ocean life colors 
25167 4 Item works perfect, but Amazons idea of Guaranteed delivery dates really leaves a bad taste in your mouth. 
25168 4 Works well with Canon Camera. 
25169 0 batteries to large for camera kept popping out couldn t close case 
25170 3 Used the batteries and charger on recent cruise and everything functioned very well! Delivery was fast as advertised, thanks. 
25171 4 awesome camera!! my kids love it :) they really love getting the picture immediately and so do I. the picture quality is great for an instant camera! 
25172 4 very good.... but the shipping is very slow...... 
25173 4 I liked the product, and had no trouble with the purchase. thank YoU! 
25174 0 It came folded not rolled could not get creases out very nice quality other than that. 
25175 4 holds my cannon and the charger. great! 
25176 4 Just perfect replacemment. 
25177 4 Highly visible and cares weight of camera. 
25178 3 Useful. Produces a low hiss. Watch out for the battery, if it becomes low, the mic will make these small pops during your recording. You have to change out your battery if this is the case. Low battery indicator won t help because it doesn t meet the threshold. 
25179 0 Product worked for about two months and then refused to work even after new batteries were installed. I m not sure if its the receiver or the transmitter. Never the less nothing works after a very short period of time. 
25180 4 Sturdy way to hold my flash!! 
25181 4 very pleased with the batteries. shipped on time. 
25182 4 Great fit... 
25183 4 Great price for what it can do. Works great as a back up to original charger. But it does get a bit hot. The added bonous is the ability to charge my battery in the car. I do not know how I lived without this feature before. 
25184 4 This is a good bag. I m using it for a Nikon camera. Everything fits in perfectly. 
25185 4 excelent 
25186 4 good quality 
25187 4 I love it... 
25188 4 Great product and great delivery. 
25189 4 Works just fine! 
25190 4 Works great with the battery from our camera. Delivered on time 
25191 4 Very satisfied with this tripod for the price. Quality is good, I m not sure if the bubble levels are accurate. Easy loading mount, ball head moves well - doesn t seem too cheap. Definitely recommended. 
25192 3 Great value, very pleased 
25193 4 very good 
25194 1 needs an adaptor 
25195 4 I have a canon t3i which I use with a 150-600mm lens. Was looking for a tripod that would handle the weight of the combination of camera and lens. This tripod can handle the weight. Very happy with it. 
25196 4 great seller - delivered as promised! 
25197 4 These batteries last forever! I like these better than Sonys rip off batteries at $80 a piece, seriously what were they thinking. 
25198 3 Works well so far, plastic camera mount could be a little more robust, but the quality does match the price-point. With careful intermittent use it shouldn t be a problem. You get what you pay for with this one. 
25199 3 Nice 
25200 0 s***!!!!! doesnt slide smooth. 
25201 4 the best ever! 
25202 4 Can t beat this price. Recharges the Wasabi and the GoPro branded batteries with no issues so I always have two available. 
25203 4 fit perfect on my canon EOS 70D! 
25204 4 Good price for peace of mind. Glad I haven t had to use it. 
25205 4 In combination with a recently purchased pistol grip tripod, it has provided excellent viewing / stargazing. 
25206 3 Very happy with the camera. Only problem I have is that it did not come with the memory chip. Other than that I was very satisfied with the purchase. 
25207 3 a little overprized but still love it! 
25208 4 Perfect....was exactly the device I needed. Like finding an old friend. Thanks. 
25209 4 Clearly a winner. Heliopan was my first, but seeing the quality, this is now my choice 
25210 4 These are useful! Happy! 
25211 4 An Excellent replacement for the one I lost. Rating: 5 of 5 The item was well packaged and came quickly. Arrived on time and was as described. Very good quality and excellent value for the money. 
25212 4 Hands down best little strap I ve used. Construction is flawless and materials are top quality. I ve used them for a year now in my wedding work and the have not left my fuji s side! 
25213 4 Nice reflector, it s me first one, but it was of a great use on the wedding day , can cover at least 4 people if used to diffuse the harsh light on a sunny day. The quality seems good. 
25214 4 Works fine, arrived in plenty of time for a vacation trip. 
25215 4 I mainly bought this kit for the UV filter, but I will use the other filters also. I keep a UV filter on my lenses all the time, mainly to protect them. The filter is cheaper to replace if damaged that your lenses! 
25216 3 It s not very high quality when handling, but once installed you can t tell it s fake or that it is cheaply made. I would buy again. 
25217 3 So far so good, working well. 
25218 4 Just happy to have a backup battery for my camera.. 
25219 4 Everything good! 
25220 3 Nice but a bit pricey, only gripe is the case only fits the iPad mini. Should have a cutout for iPad or iPad Air. 
25221 4 Wonderful works with my Sony Hdr-mv1 
25222 1 Poor quality. Adhesive last maybe a month. I took my camera on trip to Alaska. Some days were misty and protector will not stay on in that weather. 
25223 4 I use this light with my ENG Camera and Film Camera. It is a great tool for handheld cameras, especially in field production. I enjoy the product. 
25224 4 Works great. Lasts for 3 lacrosse games (on & off) no problem. No issues with the camera not recognizing it. Useful review? Let me know! 
25225 4 Very nice camera. Works as advertised 
25226 4 Great price super easy to locate controls. Only downside is there is no external power input. 
25227 4 bought it for a Nikon D90 that I use as a backup. actually wanted an SB-600 but Nikon no longer makes it. works great. 
25228 4 Like orig. 
25229 4 Perfect mate for the one I had in the battery expansion. 
25230 1 This item stopped working soon after we got it, and kodak has stopped making this product. Now I have a product that is broken and I cant get a replacement. 
25231 0 BAD picture, bad sound, cant go far...I would NOT recommend this product. 
25232 4 Super sturdy and we love it! 
25233 0 It sucks. I try instslling them but right after i turned then on they would start going off after like 3 seconds withought separating them 
25234 4 We installed this at the door in the garage, and it s motion-sensitive, so when we come home after dark, we can always see the keyhole for our deadbolt! 
25235 1 Met expectations. Nice. 
25236 4 I like this strap very well. It is of a very good quality. I highly recommend this! 
25237 3 Nice light case. 
25238 4 Solid product. Several adapters to attach things. And the legs are made well. 
25239 3 works as needed 
25240 0 Did not work as specified. WiFi from device to station would only work when within 20 feet. Would not work with Verizon FIOS landline. Returned it and purchased an alternate system which worked fine. 
25241 4 Set up was a breeze - it took about ten minutes. Picture quality and features are amazing. User manual needs to be shipped with the camera. GREAT VALUE$$$ 
25242 2 I have owned several Samsung cameras and thought this one would be work just as well. It does not. It is much slower and the flash acts like it takes a while to &#34;warm up&#34; and snap the picture. Would not order this particular model camera again. 
25243 4 Great! 
25244 4 Perfect for those long trips 
25245 4 Excellent bag for traveling with my Canon T3i along with two lenses and charger. 
25246 4 Compact Sony kit lens for the NEX series that works very well - sharp enough. 
25247 4 Great. 
25248 4 I used this with a Stellarvue eyepiece that comes with their 13x80 finder. I liked that it had a broad range of brightness down to the point where the red crosshairs were extremely faint. 
25249 2 REALLY WORKS 
25250 3 Got these on time. It looks exactly as it is in the photo. 
25251 0 This is AWFUL!! Live Video Failed after 2 days worked. Any Model All models of this brand camera I bought failed. 
25252 4 A very good lens fro macro photography 
25253 1 Although it serves my needs I was misled in the description of the product where it said it was an aluminum case it is really made of plastic 
25254 0 It hasn t worked since the day I took it out of the box. 
25255 2 kinda cheap. but so is the price. 
25256 4 Solidly made, threads work smoothly. Good craftsmanship. 
25257 0 not as expected 
25258 2 very good 
25259 4 Works well 
25260 0 never did work 
25261 4 Everything came as expected and in time too...looking forward to buying more of your products. 
25262 4 Nice little pouch! Lens slips inn nicely. Plenty of padding too. 
25263 4 Was not sure about this speedlight but I took a chance and I am glad I could. Works in manual only but the output is easily adjustable, and has good powder. Will purchase another. 
25264 4 THIS CAMERA BUNDLE IS A GREAT VALUE IT LOOKS LIKE AND HAS THE FEATURES OF MORE EXPENSIVE CAMERAS. PLUS THE BONUS OF AN EXTRA BATTERY AND ANOTHER CHARGER AND CORDS. VERY GOOD BUY!!!!!! 
25265 2 Not that good. Barely holds the camera in place. 
25266 4 best duster ever 
25267 4 excellent product , work good , easy install , good sound 
25268 0 didn t work with any of my speedlites 
25269 4 Fits all my go pro items in one little pouch 
25270 4 works very good for my cannon 10d 
25271 4 a great Little security camera loaded with exceptional features 
25272 4 Use it to carry .223 shells on my sling. 
25273 3 Having a really hard time understanding how to work it, the manual is way to small to read. 
25274 4 Great on time! 
25275 0 After the first week night vision stopped working. Now it connects when it wants to. Zero customers service!!! 
25276 3 Works good - but switches from color to black and white for some reason. 
25277 2 Batteries are good but they dont last as long as the one I got with my camera 
25278 4 The best quality fish eye equivalent for the price. Highly recommended. 
25279 3 Nice camera. I m still learning how to use it. 
25280 4 fast shipping. i love the design and very fit. if you are looking for a protector for your camera, this one is recommended. 
25281 3 This item works well so far but it is NOT the US version. Based on other feedback I m afraid to do the firmware update. No problems so far but beware. 
25282 2 freezes up sometimes and i have to unplug it 
25283 4 Keeps the camera dry and is great to keep sticky fingerprints away. 
25284 2 Money s worth. 
25285 3 Good images but a little on the weighty side for off hand viewing. Defiantly need a tripod. Good buy. 
25286 3 Not the sharpest lens I have, but it works very well for what it is. 
25287 4 They fit perfectly and work great. Definitely worth the money to have a few extra or to replace any in need. Shipping did take a while but that s expected when coming from another country. 
25288 3 Great protection for your investment. 
25289 4 Really Good mini backpack for beginners! I love it! 
25290 4 NOW I CAN VIDEO AT PARTIES LONGER LOVE IT 
25291 4 The Vivitar batteries I ordered work perfectly in my Sony a58 camera, for a fraction of the price I would have paid for Sony brand batteries. The cleaning kit was a great bonus. I was especially impressed and delighted by the size and power of the dust blower. 
25292 4 Macro is crazy detailed get an exernal light source and you re good 
25293 4 Fun for grad nite prizes... 
25294 4 Great lens! 
25295 3 Great lens filter kit 
25296 3 Admirable piece of engineering. Almost everything perfect, but a proper quick release should be fantastic 
25297 1 Too wide for my neck. 
25298 4 Excellent hdtvi dvr system. No complaints what so ever. Easy to setup. Has the best free ddns service available (hiddns). Video quality is amazing. My customers love it. Shipping was a bit slow but worth it. 
25299 4 So far so good Used a couple of times. 
25300 4 Love it 
25301 4 No complaints 
25302 4 My mother wanted me to search for something for my brother-in-law s birthday. He s really into astronomy. She got him the same model binoculars for Christmas. My sister said that he loved both of the products. 
25303 3 Used these on a construction site to mount a time lapse camera. Solid. Stable. Works well. The screws are showing signs of rust, but it was outside for months. The mfgr could use stainless steel screws if they wanted to improve the design... 
25304 3 The package is too simple, for UV lens 
25305 4 Great product. This case fits our Nikon Coolpix S33 camera just right. There is a pocket inside for an extra battery and or memory card. Heavyweight construction. Comes with a long strap. Double zippers, and a Velcro belt loop. Not much else to be said. It s a great case. 
25306 4 Just what I was looking for. Excellent lens bag, sturdy, lightweight, looks amazing! Highly recommend! 
25307 4 Great product- works better than expected 
25308 0 Much smaller than pictured, it looks like the sticker wraps around, but it doesn t. 
25309 4 One of the sharpest prime lenses on the market. 
25310 4 Great battery, easy to install fixed my problem. Came super quick, easy to install, at a great price!! Will use this seller again!! thanks td 
25311 4 They were very nice and strong but they didn t work with my vision. I could see black on the sides interfering with my vision. I tried to adjust but I have a wide bridge and my eyes just wouldn t focus enough. For someone else, I highly recommend. 
25312 2 Too large for the camera styles listed in the description. I never use this carry case. 
25313 4 Purchased this camera for our honeymoon in Tahiti. We banged it around on the paddle boards, took it snorkeling, and on our 1st diving trip ( which was only 5 or 6 meters). It took great pictures and video! Definitely TOUGH as well. 
25314 4 A++++++ 
25315 3 Perfect grip when using this as a handheld mount but an excellent desk mount for your cameras. 
25316 2 I can buy real glass protectors for this price 
25317 4 Great batteries and great for back up batteries 
25318 4 Works well for connecting mic 
25319 4 I have several really good tripods but I found myself in a place without one. I ordered this just to get me through a simple photo shoot. I was really pleased at the quality and compactness of this tripod. 
25320 4 Love it. I use it for insurance inspections. It has an amazing zoom! 
25321 4 Great to be able to charge a second battery not in the camera. 
25322 4 Easy to load and shoot. The picture develops quickly and it is nice to have a &#34;physical&#34; picture to place into an album. 
25323 0 Terrible, came with a bolt that was too short, do completely unusable. More importantly, it wasted my time because I had to find an alternative + return this poorly kitted product. 
25324 4 Works well! 
25325 4 Happy with items!! 
25326 4 This fit my Tamron lens just as described. Great price and exactly what I needed after losing my lens cap. Very satisfied and the seller was very fast with shipping. 
25327 4 Perfect addition to the Canon Rebel package I received. 
25328 0 could not make it work, sent it back 
25329 2 Wish it would start recording when power was applied to the micro usb. Originally wanted it for dash cam but keep forgetting to start or stop it. Pic quality good kids had it in pool still works. 
25330 2 One of the screws for the attachment is already stripped out 
25331 3 Works pretty good. Few of the buttons are labled wrong 
25332 4 This bag is amazing. The color is a little uninspiring, but not at all bad. It s very well built. I have been using mine every single day for over a year and it is still showing no wear whatsoever, and I m not a great owner. 
25333 3 Worked 
25334 4 Nice basic mount. Does the job. 
25335 3 the item was exactly as pictured and described. it works perfectly on my camera. I am happy to have a charger so that I am able to use my camera once again. thank you for this listing 
25336 4 Just what was needed. 
25337 2 Great kit for the price, more than I will ever use. Some pieces are cheaply made though. 
25338 3 not bad it really works quite well.. even my 5 yr old grandson can operate this..!! The record button is really easy to use !! 
25339 4 Awesome camera great pictures and features 
25340 1 THE WIRELESS VIDEO SURVEILLANCE HAS STOPPED RECORDING 
25341 4 Works well, better than expected. 
25342 4 Very well made!! Great product!! 
25343 4 ok 
25344 4 Got the propellers within a few days. They are great 
25345 4 A low cost solution to start your photography hobby. Many position options and adjustments. Great for any beginner. 
25346 4 Great! 
25347 2 Let s see what this amounts to when the time comes. 
25348 4 great transaction. Product as described 
25349 4 We used the Sony HDR-CX3800 to make a product review video of this pet fountain. [[ASIN:B00YDFMQ8M Five Star Pet Fountain for Improved Pet Health. Cats & Dogs Drink More Water When It s Oxygenated & Filtered. Easy to Clean, Quiet Operation, One Gallon Waterer. Simple Solution for a Healthier Pet.]] 
25350 4 I recommend, fast delivery. very good 
25351 2 When the backdrop arrived it was as pictured but NOT as described It should have been green/black according to the description. Also, because of the design, it is difficult to create/maintain a flat background. 
25352 4 No problems with product and/or delivery. Works on camera as described. 
25353 3 Great first microscope. 
25354 3 Works well. 
25355 4 Great! Just what I needed for this lens 
25356 4 Just as good as the name brand batteries. No problems at all. 
25357 0 Worked for about 2 seconds and with new batteries !! 
25358 1 the platform is plastic and will not hold any camera inline enough to get a decent image. you have to make changes to have it work. 
25359 4 Works very well, good quality pictures 
25360 4 good 
25361 4 Works well indoor and outdoor. I have not tried the Shutter release but the GPS works well on my Nikon D7100 
25362 3 I really like it...very versatile to carry laptop and camera 
25363 4 great 
25364 4 Great product. 
25365 4 this is the best and most stable tripod I have ever bought. 
25366 0 Not my best buy. 
25367 0 wayyyy to small , i thought it would be wider - can barely put the lens cap on 
25368 4 Good Price, great value should give me enough pwr for some long recording 
25369 1 I experienced quite a but if distortion around the edges with this on. 
25370 4 This bag is exactly what I was looking for. It has room inside for my laptop, camera, and all associated gear without being overly big. Great travel carry-on bag for all your electronics. It comes in different sizes so get the right size for your laptop. 
25371 4 I like this case,well padded, room for extra stuff, etc. 
25372 4 Love, love, love it. 
25373 4 Goes on great and protects a plastic (ugh!) screen. Much better than others I have used. A must have. 
25374 4 Works great. A nice and better replacer fid the original battery. The position of the battery on the charger can be confusing though since not all three prongs connect. 
25375 4 Got this for my son s GeekPro and everything in it worked great! We had a lot of fun with all the attachments on our vacation. Great product! 
25376 4 So far so good. Great service 
25377 3 For the money it is a very good deal! 
25378 3 Great can b used for number of things.Thx very much. 
25379 3 Takes great pictures, but i wish it wouldn t run out of battery so quickly. 
25380 4 A nice size card that fits in my gadget bag nicely. 
25381 1 There shouldn t be any functionality problem since it is just air blower but I couldn t stand the strong odor from the rubber pump. I can t use or store it because of the smell. 
25382 4 The protector works great, after 8 months it is still on the camera! Great service would use seller again! 
25383 4 Good 
25384 4 Love it 
25385 2 The video quality is poor, otherwise it is a great system. I use it for home security and I am impressed with it thus far. Just wish that the video quality was better. 
25386 3 Great camera case used with high quality fabrics. 
25387 4 Quality product. I love it. 
25388 4 Good quality cables, great price. 
25389 3 Love the tripod and blue tooth clicker. It made family beach pictures so much easier until the screw got crossthreaded, or something, in the plastic hold to hold the camera at a tilt. I m not sure how that happened b/c I hadn t messed with it. 
25390 1 Flimsy and falls off too often. 
25391 4 Great buy works perfect very happy 
25392 4 Fantastic!!! 
25393 4 Works as described I recommend.Be sure to have it plugged into your router with an Ethernet cable when you first configure it. Once configured it works fine over Wi-Fi. It just can t be initially configured over Wi-Fi. 
25394 4 Received on time.. Product quality is good for the price.. Thanks.. 
25395 4 Did what it was supposed to; arrived in a timely manner. 
25396 4 Very Nice & well made & Really like the way it Works ! Great ! ! 
25397 4 Great package. Great product 
25398 3 good not great 
25399 4 Great bargain. Quality product. 
25400 4 i got the shots i wanted with this filter. no problems. 
25401 3 too much on this thing, but an idiot like me can take goods pics it must be ok 
25402 3 Might be a little to petite for a professional that relies on many mounts and casings, but for a single case and knowing what mount you were to use this is practical. Hard casing helps to protect but hard to pack into a backpack if limited space. 
25403 4 Easy, fast, safe and comfortable! 
25404 3 Interface could be better, but it works well enough 
25405 4 This bag has replaced all of my bags. I literally take this everywhere I go now. Trust me, it is worth it. 
25406 4 Very happy with items. 5 STARS AND great product. 
25407 4 Everything was as promised. Thanks! 
25408 4 I lost my spare battery somewhere between a session, an event and home. Thankfully I was able to find the exact battery and have it delivered quickly. 
25409 4 This kit was everything I expected. It fits my camera great. I ve used most of the body gear parts and selfie stick already. I m having a blast putting together my videos. The case makes it easy to keep things together. 
25410 4 My granddaughter loves it. 
25411 4 Nice price 
25412 4 Henry was a great help with the wifi connection! Not having access to the router definitely made things difficult, but not impossible. Happy to be able to watch the pups from home and not having to worry. Glad its connected finally. Thanks to Henry! case id# c6721161henry AR004273 
25413 1 Not compatable to a mac 
25414 4 The battery worked just as expected, and you CANNOT beat the price! I did not notice any degradation in quality compared to the one I have that came with my camera. 
25415 4 I recommend. 
25416 4 This camera works great and the picture is clear. This is a great product and hopefully i get my moneys worth out of it, if it has any problems. I highly recommend this camera 
25417 4 great price holds charge like dream 
25418 4 VERY HANDY LOVE IT AND THESSE ARE ALLOWED ON ANY DISNEY RIDE 
25419 3 Decent protector. I have used this brand before and have been happy 
25420 4 Nice and sturdy 
25421 4 Works great! 
25422 4 Case Number: C6725987 Tech ID: AR004273 Description about my service experience with the technician was extremely helpful in setting up both of my Dlink cameras. He was the best technician I have ever worked with over the phone. 
25423 2 Not the greatest design but adequate 
25424 4 Wow! Great printer and great color! I take lots of pictures on my phone and DSLR and having a portable printer is super convenient and fun! People are amazed at the quality of the prints and Ive had a lot of questions about where I bought them! 
25425 4 thank you for this order 
25426 4 Works great! 
25427 4 I replaced a Sony A350 with this camera. I am very happy with the Sony A58 camera. I am more about taking photos than using the video that it has... I guess one day I will try that out, but for now, it s all about good photos. 
25428 4 Everything is in excelent condition, it came with 32 gb sd card and sony bag. One of the best deals ever! 
25429 3 it is a great one specially for quick and easy shots. video is great except battery life is too short in that case. I used it during my vacation to London and i had a great like processional photos 
25430 4 Arrived promptly, in quality pkging. All worked, no issues. 
25431 4 so far great price and performance. 
25432 4 I highly recommend this item. 
25433 4 Product arrived quickly. Batteries work great in my Samsung camera. The charger & 2 spare batteries give me more options than just plugging in my camera and waiting for a recharge. Order from this company. You will be pleased and amused. :) 
25434 4 did exactly what it was supposed to do 
25435 4 Works very nicely with my my scope. 
25436 4 worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks. 
25437 4 Brief comment is really all that s necessary. I bought the product, and it works perfectly. Furthermore, it s way cheaper than buying the branded battery from Canon. Definitely recommended. 
25438 4 Exactly what I was looking for. Sturdy construction, fast setup/take-down and I get the results I expect with it. And love the ball head mount - much better than I expected for this price. Couldn t be happier. 
25439 4 Everything was there and in good shape. Very happy with order. 
25440 2 Not sure I understood utilizing this product with my 85 Carl Zeis lens would leave it in manual. Frustrating sometimes. I will prob just use my Sony body. 
25441 4 Works awsome 
25442 4 Just what I needed for a short notice event. All the basics for low drama preparation. 
25443 4 Good Buy 
25444 4 works very well just what i wanted 
25445 4 works well, delivered quickly. no complaints. 
25446 3 ok 
25447 4 Very versatile works as expected. 
25448 3 High quality video, audio is very good. Had a few times where the video/audio cut out, but that was most likely due to a dodgy internet connection. Just make sure you ve got a WiFi extender and you shouldn t have any streaming interruptions. 
25449 4 Product was as described. Transaction was smooth. 
25450 4 Love it!! 
25451 4 Love, Love, Love, Love, Love!!!! Really nothing else to say...I have NO regrets about purchasing this camera!!! It s a blast to use and footage is amazing in and out of water, on moving vehicles, on moving pets, for stills, and anything you can imagine. 
25452 4 Came as promised. A lot of great accessories! 
25453 4 Love taking pictures with it for the first time. For an amateur, I like the speed for taking pictures. I still have to explore the many features of this camera. 
25454 3 Coool 50mm prime... use it all the time to create unique perspectives 
25455 0 Broke after 4 uses 
25456 0 Bought for my friends trip to Africa & didn t even work, Says needed Battery or something:( 
25457 0 Horrible product. I haven t even had this bag for 3 months and the zippers already broke off. Also to inforce that I have not used it often. The worst bag I ve had. 
25458 4 Great camera....love the Jpegs right out of the camera. The film simulations are spectacular! Use this camera and a Pentax Kiis....combo give me full photo flexibility.. 
25459 4 I can focus it at trees leaves and random daylight 
25460 3 rec d as promised and as advertised 
25461 2 Work OK little low on life of battery 
25462 3 A little smaller than expection. 
25463 4 metal and good fit for filters 
25464 4 Great unit for the money, easy to operate 
25465 4 Soft and girlie, loved this neck strap for our honeymoon in Ireland. Much better than that Nikon strap! Held my Nikon 3200 perfectly in place for the entire trip. 
25466 4 use it for the fujifilm xp70 
25467 4 Great lens cap, great value. 
25468 4 Love the colors and the price. Fits around neck comfortably. I got a compliment on the color while taking pictures on the street. 
25469 4 Great 
25470 0 I bought this cap for a Fujifilm Finepix S9200. It s well made and very nice, and I received it quickly. However it does not fit the lens. I need to send it back. 
25471 3 very good quality. love the carrying case! 
25472 4 so fun and cute! 
25473 3 Did what it needed too. 
25474 4 Richard Excellent support setting up the camera for remote viewing. Thank you. Camera is great. Doing exactly what I wanted. 
25475 4 It s an excellent product that beyond I expect. 
25476 4 Good size bag. Pretty comfortable to carry around. Not too obvious that it is a camera bag. 
25477 3 works well 
25478 2 It prevents good sound recording but keeps the water from getting into the device 
25479 2 Great on planets but blurs more distant objects 
25480 4 These are so nice and easy to take off and put on. 
25481 3 admitible 
25482 4 love it all. No problems. 
25483 3 Arrived quickly. Good illumination control from the dial. Little heavy with the batteries. Good product. 
25484 1 Saw double not in adjustment 
25485 4 Easy to fly. Would like to see longer range. 
25486 4 works well. 
25487 4 Bought this GoPro Travel and Carrying Case for my son s new GoPro4 and he loves it. 
25488 4 Works as expected batteries seem to work good so far as well. This charger is nice because you get a charger and two batteries. If you tried to get canon original batteries and charger this same deal would be over 150 dollars, so this is a no brainer. 
25489 3 I was very pleased with my purchase. I bought it for my nephew for his 18th bday and he loved it. Very well made and has plenty of padding and straps for carrying. Would recommend. 
25490 4 You can t beat the price,not bad video. 
25491 4 It provides good IQ and it reduces the size of the whole set so it fits into my pocket now!! 
25492 4 So far so good. 
25493 4 Works great! Just the right size, too. 
25494 1 I tried to use these according to the instructions and I still can t seem to get the quality out of them that I was hoping to get. They are made well so I ll give it two stars, but I really don t like how they work. 
25495 4 Thanks 
25496 4 NOTE: NO LEGS It would be unfair to mark it 4 stars. It is exactly what it claims to be, but it really needs some fold out legs for indoor usage. 2 stands and clamps work for a quick setup. 
25497 3 Wide viewing angle. Night vision is good but can be better ( compared to the camera I have from ADT). Overall, it is a good camera and worth the price paid for. 
25498 4 A OK..... 
25499 4 works well 
25500 4 Great price fast survive 
25501 1 Takes a long time to &#34;charge&#34; for each flash. 
25502 1 It came deformed... Not very helpful when it shows up in the frame due to its deformation. I would not recommend this. 
25503 4 richard helped me with setting everything up. its soooo simple and easy and now i can watch my apartment from my latop or my phone for free! i love this camera. the quality is amazing 
25504 4 Excellent 
25505 4 This item was better than what I thought it would be and I am very please. This looks very elegant and made of a thick cloth not like the thin ones that I have seen. 
25506 4 fits perfectly 
25507 4 Very easy to set up , only thing is that it only records at 960 not hd , so no need to buy hd cameras 
25508 4 Amazing price. Good camera fit with a couple of extra pockets. Sharp looking with Nikon emblem. 
25509 4 Perfect! Exactly as described! Thank you! 
25510 4 Given as a gift, recipient was extremely happy 
25511 4 Awesome product! Everything is perfect! 
25512 4 Perfect fit for my new Panasonic FZ-70. Charged perfectly and have tried both batteries, everything is good. The lens cloth and brush are nice bonuses too! 
25513 0 Don t buy 
25514 4 Great camera will buy again 
25515 4 Remote release cord functions perfectly; replicates the shutter release button on my D7100 in every way. 
25516 1 I have to change my review....I just returned the frame....when I was sitting right by it, the pics were great....once I moved it across the room and at a different level....it was hard to see ....a lot of black spots. Our original nix was not like that..... 
25517 3 Works fine but still need a stand. 
25518 4 Great product, prompt delivery. Love the clear pouches for storing the cleaning cloths! 
25519 4 So much better than changing batteries. Motor runs faster than with battery power 
25520 3 Good little pack here, but the mono pod stick isn t all that great. I ve seen better ones, no control button on the handle end. But you get what you pay for 
25521 4 Good materials and exactly the right size I needed, for a nikon d3200 + battery grip + 55-200mm lens. 
25522 4 Very easy to use. Great video quality, in a very small package. Would definitely recommended to anyone looking for a camera that is easy to conceal. 
25523 2 This case adds protection and a nice look of refinement. The con is that it makes it a little harder to get the SD card out. 
25524 0 only they used, and they are broke or not working where I can send it to the fix, since it has a one year warranty I am looking forward to your response Thank you nelson 
25525 3 arrived as expected. Works well. Good product. 
25526 3 Pretty good. Works as described. I wish there was a way to reverse it 
25527 3 easy to use and great quality. 
25528 3 Does a great job when used with the zeiss lense care cleaner 
25529 4 This is an excellent &#34;bean bag&#34; for photograhy use. Is made to last and the Neoprene surface prevents slippage. Filled mine with one bag 32oz (907grams) of Fairfield Poly-Pellets Stuffing Beads which are sold by Amazon. The bag s maker LensCoat has a line of first-rate products. 
25530 4 Perfect Replacement on my Canon Rebel. 
25531 0 Poor product! When I play back my videos it glitches hard. Over heats too 
25532 4 Works great- all functions very compatible and highly recommend 
25533 0 I installed the update from their web site and the unit does not work now. I have tried to contact them about the problem and have not received a reply. Sent them another email today I hope to hear soon. 
25534 0 Very cheaply built. This tripod is very flimsy and barely supports the weight of my camera. The level feature doesn t even have any liquid in it. Please do not buy this tripod. You will only end up disappointed. 
25535 4 Nicely fitting case. 
25536 0 Doesn t charge 
25537 3 Impressed with Value, Quality and quickness of shipping. 
25538 4 This is a great rolling camera case. Holds everything I need for photographing weddings. 
25539 2 awesome, sure took a lot of pics under water 
25540 4 Perfect 
25541 0 I returned mine. The rain bag is HUGE. Not usable for a mirrorless ILC camera. The quality feels cheap and would ve been cumbersome to use even if it did fit. 
25542 4 Fits perfect, and works great. 
25543 4 Vincent Did a wonderful job on getting the camera working properly in a short time!! Wish I could get him again if/when I need help!! 
25544 4 Excellent product at a great price. Plugs into the wall, has a car charger, cheaper than the Nikon branded charger. I don t see why you would opt for anything else! 
25545 2 Very nice well padded camera bag but to large for my point and shoot camera. 
25546 4 Perfect 
25547 4 it floats - easy to see in water, pool, lake and ocean! must go with bright orange colors! 
25548 3 Yes it is what it is. 
25549 4 Great camera! 
25550 0 Terrible product. They do not fir American cassette players 
25551 4 As advertised 
25552 0 They do not fit the camera at all. 
25553 2 it is okay for the price. Accomplishes the purpose of keeping an eye on my dog outside. After four months I ve had some wifi connectivity issues where i have to reboot the camera. 
25554 3 works just fine, but the batteries seem to have a short life 
25555 4 Product Arrived on time and intact.Thank you........Mike 
25556 4 excelete 
25557 3 A really great buy! So reliable, reasonably priced. Really keeps everything organized and protected. Wonderful for having a lot of equipment and yet wonderfully simple. My only downside is that I wish it came in different colors or designs. 
25558 4 it was perfect 
25559 3 like the size but doesn t always stay in one place.. 
25560 4 Good quality and good price. Very satisfied. 
25561 0 El19 charger adapter does Not even come close to fitting el19 battery!! Who built this a three year old? Worthless device!! 
25562 0 Wasn t able to get it to work with my Canon 5D at all. Tried all the troubleshooting tips I could find online, YouTube videos, etc. Finally ended up returning it. 
25563 4 This prime makes you work for the shot. The bokeh is crazy and depth of field is very narrow. Perfect for dreamy, ethereal work made from afar. Minimum focal distance is about 6 .... 
25564 4 Works great!!! 
25565 4 Good as described 
25566 2 great it was well worth the purchase, the camera is now outdated needs to be replaced 
25567 4 Gift - recipient loved it! 
25568 4 Excellent 
25569 4 5 stars for the price 
25570 4 I have not used all the lenses yet so really can t give a fair review, however, I love the kit and carry it with me in my camera bag, I especially like the microfiber cloth for cleaning my camera and the lenses. It does a great job! 
25571 4 good clear picture. will use as a security camera when I go on vacation. 
25572 1 fukky The plastic ring that is attached to the hand string on the extension pole broke and my go pro fell 35 feet down. Thankfully one of the catamaran workers was a crazy free diver and went and got it. 
25573 1 Whenever you use this lens for Indore shooting with standards flash you get this lens shadow on pictures captured at below 35mm focal length. You have to use external flash light or capture without flash. Useful only for outdoor shooting without using standard flash. 
25574 4 A well made quality camera sling. At first, it can be a little tricky in using the optional armpit strap, but once you become familiar with it, you are good to go, without slippage that you get from other camera slings. 
25575 3 I got these in the mail and all of the Capacitors were bent over. after Testing I carefully moved the capacitors back into place and tested again and they all still worked. Rating would be higher if packaged a little differently but for the price I couldn t complain. 
25576 1 Always buy this products do is good , for some reason this time picture where no good, we waist half pack, picture never look good :( 
25577 4 Love it. Takes great pictures at a portable size. I love being out door, hiking, boating, jet skis, four wheeling, etc and this camera is great for travel. I can slip it in my pocket and go go go and get awesome pics too. :) 
25578 4 Perfect 
25579 4 perfecto 
25580 3 It is what it is. I m still learning how and where and when I will use it , but it serves my originally intended purpose very well and is fairly sturdy. 
25581 4 great item and fast shipping 
25582 3 GOOD BIRD 
25583 4 This is the best slider I ever had. It s short to carry, extends on a tripod, super smooth ride for awesome shots. Wide rails can hold heavier load. Inexpensive, well built, and it s pleasure to work with it. I rate it A+++. 
25584 4 This will make it so much easier to take pics. works great 
25585 3 Thank You 
25586 4 Fits great` 
25587 4 Excellent value. I have a GoPro but this excellent value allows me to place a camera in more dangerous locations with less concern. Mask works great also. 
25588 4 It worked so well that I bought two more. 
25589 4 excelent 
25590 4 Wow! I am really impressed with the quality! It is very sturdy and solid. The tripod is heavy, so I don t see myself lugging this thing around on a nature walk, but I knew that from the other reviews. 
25591 4 Exceptional quality, performance, and guarantees. The filters from this great company are now the best ones I m using. 
25592 4 Great purchase! Just remember you need to manual focus...no big deal for me. 
25593 4 worked grate 
25594 4 Awesome camera & bundle! 
25595 3 A unique solution that was very much needed. Been using it for months now and it hasn t broke. Very surprising given what this thing is 
25596 4 Works great 
25597 4 Excellent bulbs. Very bright, doesn t get very hot & no buzzing. 
25598 4 Solid case. Tight seal. Fits Gopro, battery charger, plug and two batteries easily. Carabiner is cheap, but I swapped it out for an s-biner. Clear lid is nice if you have multiple boxes that are the same color. 
25599 3 Good product and fit at an affordable price. Only negative is it took over a month to ship from China. 
25600 2 Doesn t hold a charge as well as the battery that came with the drone. 
25601 1 Didn t fit the Canon Mark II as advertised (requires an adapter). Misleading BS and it s overpriced. 
25602 2 Does its job 
25603 4 Wow great item for great price 
25604 0 I received a tripod that has been used and has scratches all over. I didn t return it yet because I feel lazy of going through the return process. 
25605 1 There is a big problem to installing it without a detailed English instruction manual; for example: the function and connecting the J1,J2 and J3 terminals. 
25606 4 Hooked it up prior to installing and everything looks good 
25607 4 10 points. everything was as expected 
25608 4 Good camera, especially you don t need remember about battery charging. Just keep extra 4 AA with you. Quality is great for this price, well you are not buying a $1000 camera, so don’t expect more for this money. 
25609 4 Exactly what I need for pictures 
25610 4 cheap and good 
25611 4 In case your camera lenses are vampires like mine. 
25612 4 Nice addition to the camera bag. This along with the STK aftermarket batteries have been extremely reliable (just as good as the factory units). 
25613 4 This is such a cute camera!! 
25614 4 A good product. 
25615 1 It s so small so it s kind of hard to focus in on an object. Not very pleased with it. 
25616 4 I ordered this because I ve always wanted a polaroid. Best purchase I ve ever made! It came very quickly, and is so cute! Definitely worth the money I payed for it! 
25617 4 as advertised 
25618 2 Does the job, but very hard to find the right focus. 
25619 4 It s perfect 
25620 3 Bought this for my Pentax k-50 with 18-55mm lens. Fits snugly and works just fine. Note: This is for the weather resistant form of the lens, from what I understand this will not fit the non-WR lens. 
25621 4 As advertised. Works great for sunsets. 
25622 4 I absolutely love these little lenses... I have had fun playing around. My favorite is the macro lens and here is an image where it was used. My phone is iPhone 6 plus... 
25623 0 it does not fucus well, bought it for fy son s 8th grade promotion... and ended it taking pictures with my phone, they came out better with my phone :( 
25624 4 I love it.!!! 
25625 4 My Daughter love this, I gave it to her for her 11th birthday 
25626 0 fake leather.screw not work on tripod 
25627 4 I received my camera today and was very pleased with it. It arrived earlier than anticipated, it was the best priced camera and had the most accessories included. I can t wait to try it out this weekend with the family! 
25628 3 Lights up the area I wanted it to 
25629 4 Plenty of room for my scope and camera with several lenses 
25630 1 Shows black and white and no wireless. 
25631 4 Really happy with this case. It holds my Samsung point-and-shoot. Has a small pocket for cords or cards. Just perfect. 
25632 3 I ve had this for a few years now and it has never given me a bit of trouble. The only complaint I have is that I wish it had a feature to reorient an individual picture. 
25633 4 the best choice for pro photo shoot 
25634 3 Works good in my Canon VIXIA HFR20. Gives battery time remaining on the screen. So camera thinks it s a Canon battery. 
25635 4 Good price-good product-fast delivery. 
25636 2 My videos and images are of poor contrast and lots of noises even in good light, don t know if this the case with others or not. 
25637 4 Great selfie stick, I love it 
25638 0 well after using this the first time I needed to order a new Panasonic ZS40 to replace my ZS20 Youz can guess the rest anyway hate to upgrade that way 
25639 4 If you re gonna drop the money for the T5, get this bundle. The extras are good quality, and the extra lens makes this an awesome deal. 
25640 3 a gift 
25641 3 Pictures were nice and functioned under water. However some of the pictures look blurry. 
25642 4 Works perfectly. Helps get the best shot and is super sturdy! 
25643 4 Works great! 
25644 3 I did plenty of research and this was a great deal. I was also happy the bag was Canon brand. Although the 16 gig memory card was corrupted after just 4 uses??!! 
25645 4 The real deal! 
25646 4 very happy good product 
25647 4 Everything Ok! Thanks 
25648 4 Great little package, easy to mount and install...Thanks 
25649 4 Workout great 
25650 4 Exactly what I needed for my Tamron 70-200 mm 2.8. Fits with lens hood and collar. Nice quality and protects lens well. 
25651 3 not bad for the price, not the best quality. 
25652 1 did not fit 
25653 4 Amazing! My husband love stargazing but doesn t like to pull out our big telescope all the time this has been perfect for him. I would definitely reccomend a good tripod with this to get the clearist view. 
25654 2 This tripod is great for a point and shoot. I used it in a pinch to set my dslr on, but don t trust it. 
25655 4 Good 
25656 1 Leg support came apart after a few weeks and the little handle broke. 
25657 3 Good veiw 
25658 4 5 stars because you can t beat the value for price. I filmed a time lapse first chance I got and loved the results. Using the wifi mode a huge plus. 
25659 3 Very nice product.....! 
25660 0 First of all, don t advertise a specific color when it isn t available. If I wanted a pink one, I would have ordered a pink one. I didn t even bother checking quality because I m so disappointed with the color. 
25661 3 I got this so I can be able to load up my photos on my computer. 
25662 4 Works great on my t3i. Love how the photos turn out with this lens. It s a lot heavier than I expected to be. Not really a problem though. 
25663 4 Our family loves hiking and this makes even the younger one to go on one Very comfortable on delicate skin of younger kids too 
25664 3 The memory card that it comes with is not a micro card. 
25665 4 great Quality and great Service it fit my Camera perfect give it a try. 
25666 2 This is the gift for my mom and she loves it. But the automatically turn on/off function is not working. 
25667 4 This was everything I needed it to be. It is a great small Tripod good for webcam or still digital camera. It holds the camera steady and is easy to adjust. 
25668 4 Does the job. Takes quick photos and prints them out. So glad I have this camera. :) 
25669 4 Great value!!!! 
25670 4 love it It makes my camera larger and easy to hold... 
25671 1 waste of money 
25672 4 Got exactly what was advertised. Fit like a glove. Now I have a replacement!! Great deal! 
25673 4 Great item! The set is definitely worth the cost. 
25674 2 I give this product 3 stars because the tripod broke after 2 days I had the tripod, I read the reviews about it and they were true. The other reason why is that the quality of the camera isn t too good but I still like it. 
25675 4 Works as intended. Fast delivery. If you need a portable light, you can not go wrong with this one. 
25676 3 Very nice case. Only reason it didn t get a &#34;5&#34; was it needed to be a little bigger for me. Fine quality case though. 
25677 4 Perfect gift, daughter loved it 
25678 4 Perfect fit. 
25679 4 It s very very good, buy it !!!! 
25680 1 I am going to send the product back. It will not do what I bought it for. I wanted to use it for surveillance looking through a window to the outside and the picture quality just is not there. 
25681 4 Product is as advertised. 
25682 4 Fine! It s just a charger! 
25683 0 BE CAREFUL! It is good, if you have little camera and you need it just sometimes at family meetings and don´t want to spend money for expensife stuff, but for middle-sized cameras it´s absolutely terrible. For active photographing it´s too weak! 
25684 4 The product arrived right on time. I used the charger to charge the old battrey, and it worked great. The &#34;charging light&#34; and &#34;fully changed light&#34; worked as they should. Good product so far. 
25685 0 Product broke as soon as I opened it. The part the camera sits on comes off now and I can t seem to fix it.. 
25686 4 I ordered several lenses from Digital Goja. Everything was great. I wouldn t hesitate to order more from them in the future. 
25687 4 Awesome product 
25688 4 What can be said about a mobius that hasn t been said already? Great picture, light, and easy to mount in a variety of locations. Wish I hadn t waited so long to buy one. 
25689 4 it works o.k. thank you dan 
25690 4 This is a must buy for observing the moon. The moon is incredibly bright. Good quality filter fits right on any 1.25&#34; EP. 
25691 4 Awesome camera for the price! I snorkel with it twice a week. Underwater shots are amazing! 
25692 4 I love this camera, exactly what im looking for. I used so much for street photography, my travels and partys, everything in one camera. I just I love t. 
25693 4 It is perfect for my camera! Great and fast service! 
25694 4 Good for the price - works well 
25695 4 Seem very durable. Wish you could pick the color. I got the white ones. 
25696 4 Excellent. Works great for my camera! 
25697 0 the light doesnt work 
25698 4 Arrived quickly and fits my Sony @6000 perfectly. 
25699 3 This is great for a day trip and if you don t want to carry a lot of lenses. very comfortable to wear. 
25700 4 Everithing was as I expected 
25701 4 Fits tight, but that s how I like it. Case comes with a shoulder strap, main pocket for the camera, and outer pocket for memory cards and batteries. Works great at a great price 
25702 4 Very happy with my product and fast shipping 
25703 4 I really love this filter. It is so much better then stacking filters. All you have to do is dial in the darkness you want and shoot 
25704 4 GOOD! 
25705 1 Dont have batteries 
25706 2 Kit was ok, but bag was smaller than I expected. 
25707 4 Works great! Easily charges my GoPro battery. 
25708 1 Received shattered screen twice. Amazon/seller was quick to refund my purchases, but it suffices to say, I will not be ordering another one. I wouldn t classify this item as &#34;ultra durable.&#34; 
25709 4 This is a great camera. I take it everywhere with me. It takes great pictures and has an easy to understand layout for us novices. 
25710 3 Does what it s supposed to. 
25711 0 If you re 3 inches away from the &#34;camera&#34;, the motion detector works great. You get what you pay for. I bought 2 and only one works. 
25712 3 nice 
25713 4 Saw comment from someone else that charger was cheap plastic....so big deal. It works great and the batteries charge fine. I am absolutely satisfied for this battery pack and charger. 
25714 4 Fits my Pentax K50 perfectly. No issues. 
25715 4 The product arrived quickly and works very well. I have a three-story town home, and it keeps me from having to climb up and down the stairs to talk. 
25716 4 I think this might be the best lens money can buy, if you only have $50 to spend on a lens. 
25717 4 This gopole is lightweight and durable. Has held up from many high impact falls. Collapses small enough to pack in a backpack. 
25718 3 Nice LITTLE LED light for cell phone, good value and good price. It was made for iPhone 4s, included a 4s case. You will probably use the lights only and throw away the case. 
25719 4 Perfect 
25720 4 great value 
25721 2 It s ok. 
25722 4 Excellent quality, feels very solid excellent picture. Easy to set up. A word of caution: make sure you restart your router and camera after making changes to your router and camera settings. It will make your life easier. 
25723 4 Absolutely love this lens. Got it for a Canon Rebel T3i and it is amazing! LOVE it. Would definitely recommend. 
25724 4 Works with Piper system... took a while to get connected but it finally got up and running and works great! 
25725 3 This is a great buy but if you haven t got your Phantom yet buy the Phantom kit with 2 batteries and save some money. 
25726 4 Compact size, perfect. 
25727 4 So far so good. it really need a powerful memory card tho. 
25728 4 Works well! 
25729 4 Excelent 
25730 4 Great for weddings 
25731 3 Works fine. Like most products it could use a better manual. 
25732 3 Seems to successfully charge the Ricoh GR also, for those that may be wondering. Your mileage may vary but it seems compatible with the otherwise difficult to find proprietary in-camera charging cable. 
25733 4 Coolpix indeed. Great 20mp pix with Nikon simple (if you read instructions) focusing. 
25734 4 Does what I expect a tiny tripod to do. Holds my T3i well, but usually it sits under my GoPro or Contour+2. Feels like pretty solid construction. 
25735 4 Great 
25736 3 its good for what it is but I should have bought a longer zoom 
25737 4 My husband and I are professional photographers and we both love these. They leave camera lenses (and eyeglasses!) lint free and the price is awesome. Great product. Excellent service. 
25738 4 Drone is fantastic! The seller did a great job in shipping it quickly. This being a 4K camera you ll have to put it in JPEG or some other format for others to view your video. 
25739 4 Extremely impressed by the quality of the drone and the images we have been able to capture. HIGHLY recommended! 
25740 4 Works good so far. 
25741 4 good 
25742 3 Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found that it fits fine. One star off because it s not quite Canon quality, but then again it s not Canon Price either. Good looking and works, for a reasonable price. 
25743 4 Amazing for the money! 
25744 4 Love it! 
25745 4 Nice camera and its construction looks and feels solid. I like its features and although I am an amateur photographer it helps me to take nice pictures. 
25746 4 good coverage. user friendly. good quality video. 
25747 4 Great piece of equipment, got it for my wife. 
25748 4 Great camera. Comes with lens cap and neck strap. Great photos. This really takes great pictures and really looks and works like a brand new camera. Would definitely recommend. 
25749 4 great modifier, good quality 
25750 0 Worst kit ever!! Because of those accessories I lost my gopro! 
25751 4 If you don t want to spend the big bucks for name brand batteries, these are definitely for you. Great price, great packaging, and no problems at all with either of the batteries. 
25752 2 Cut to the chase, you pretty much get what you pay for here, the quick release plate lever is very weak and flimsy... 
25753 3 Good one 
25754 4 I had previously purchased a T5 from The Imaging World and was very pleased with the service and fast shipping. I am still breaking in my new 70D and the purchase experience was once again excellent. 
25755 3 Great for a low cost alternative. Most useful in the sun. 
25756 4 Bought to keep as a spare. Arrived just before I broke a bulb. 
25757 3 I am really enjoying my camera but the best part is the service in setting it up. 
25758 3 very happy with this, nice upgrade from my Spyder 2 
25759 4 Greatt 
25760 4 Does what it s supposed to do and does it at a cheap price. Can t go wrong. I use this on my Nikon D3300 
25761 4 Exactly what we needed and works great! 
25762 0 Images are faded not sharp and clear. I should have bought a spotting scope with a camera attachment. 
25763 4 everything was great!! 
25764 4 These are worth every penny, I also shoot with alien bees and Einstein. These will perform perfect for anyone starting out that does not want to spend a lot of money right away. 
25765 4 Works great, no fuss. Standard 2-flat-prone connector for the US as well as car charger and EU adaptor as stated. 
25766 0 The grip does not match the photo. It does not have the &#34;thumb joystick toggle&#34; or the other button. It feels poorly made and is clearly not a quality clone of the Canon vertical grip for the 7d mkII 
25767 3 I would have given it 5 stars if I wasn t missing the thread adapter I have to now go get one from Home Depot myself :/ other than that the build quality is superb for this price 
25768 3 Takes good pictures 
25769 1 Flimsy, tons of bubbles (and i applied correctly), not very strong adhesive 
25770 3 Not bad. Does the job. The pin hole for the video is more obvious than I would like but no one has noticed it yet. 
25771 4 They are the best comparing to any price point. The 15X50 are ideal all the way to as close as 15 feet. Not heavy as some have said. You can read reviews all day long as I did, you will not find a better pair anywhere! 
25772 4 Complete package deal! 
25773 4 Works and fits very well. Wayyyyy cheaper than really right stuff brand that is similar. Fits all really right stuff ball heads and mefoto heads 
25774 4 Works great! Thank you! 
25775 1 Everything was good but it did not contain the yellow float, so we had to go buy one for another twenty dollars. 
25776 2 Works good, but is flimsy and bends easily, if your camera is over a pound or so the tripod becomes unstable. 
25777 4 The cameras are great. They do exactly what I needed. 
25778 4 This is a great bag,just what I was looking for! 
25779 3 Good 
25780 4 A great purchase. If I bought it again, though, I would purchase the larger one. It is difficult to fold up, though. Look for a tutorial on youtube and plan to take a few times before you figure it out. 
25781 4 I ve used this lens with a d3200 and it makes the pictures look stunning. This lens produces sharp and detailed images. This is a bang for your buck because you can t beat the price. 
25782 4 Highly Recommended !! 
25783 4 Very good camera 
25784 3 Works great. Only drawback is that it is a large heavy piece of equipment. 
25785 4 Great camera, great pictures, easy to use. 
25786 4 Excellent 
25787 4 Awesome unit. The technology this has is amazing! Should cost thousands more! Does everything it says it doeas and more. Pics are beyond belief! Don t be scared, my 5 year old grandson can fly it! 
25788 4 Better pictures with this. Should have had one long ago 
25789 4 thicker walls than original. fits great. 
25790 4 The waterproof housing is foolproof. The picture quality is excellent. And, it s easy to use. 
25791 4 Excelent product 
25792 4 The glasses are awesome. The video and audio are exactly what I was hoping for, and the simplicity of using the glasses a huge bonus. 
25793 4 I was recording a video of me plowing my driveway and this microphone recorded even when I was inside the truck and more than 60 feet away! 
25794 4 Excellent lens! 
25795 4 These are just as good as the original GoPro batteries and seem to last just as long if not a little longer. I ve been using these for about 2 months now with no problems to date. 
25796 0 Panhead broke in just one use. VERY weak. I can t purchase the panhead alone. But what do you expect for $16. 
25797 4 Worked great. Needed for a speech class in college and worked without a hiccup. 
25798 4 I love this pack. Its very well built, fits my Phantom 3, Canon 7D, 24-700, 70-200, 50 1.2, and all needed accessories. So nice to have everything in one bag. Great product! 
25799 4 Batteries arrived on time and fit into my D90 perfectly and are just what I needed 
25800 2 ITS JUST A a bigger version of a micro usb 
25801 4 Love this little album. It will be perfect for a guest book at my daughter s Jamaica wedding.!!! 
25802 4 Great bundle! Especially awesome considering I was headed to Europe with it and it already had a converter! 
25803 1 Somewhat usable, constantly have to make adjustments and re tighten parts of the rig that easily become loose. Rig is very front heavy when assembled with any serious camera set up. I need at least 10 pounds on my shoulder to balance it. 
25804 4 Very Powerful, but heavy 
25805 3 Great lines. The low light performance isn t the best but that s not really what it is for. The zoom range is excellent. 
25806 2 For the price its a decent value. Only wish O could afford better glass 
25807 3 Used these for a DIY Photobooth we put together for our wedding. Everyone loved them! Really easy to put together, but I recommend using a glue gun versus the glue tabs that it comes with. 
25808 4 Works great. For all the reviewers that complain about it only facing one direction: try turning the pole..... 
25809 4 Very smooth and solid !!! The slider is very smooth, didn’t need any adjustment. You can use the screw(package included) to connect your dslr camera, but i recommend you to connect with a ball head. Cause it will be more flexiable to operate. 
25810 4 Replaced the pick and pluck after a month. Went with the padded dividers for on set use. I can put the pick and pluck back in when I fly. 
25811 4 Great cable 
25812 3 Gave this one as a gift and it was well received. 
25813 1 These are not bad but the fit with the clips is very very tight. I have had to grind off a few high points to get them to work. My next order I ll spend the extra money for the gopro clips. 
25814 0 Did not work!!!!!! 
25815 3 Works, awesome for it s price, if you zoom out completely u will have dark edges,and I don t bother made a lead many great picd 
25816 2 cheap for what it is 
25817 4 I have shot some of the most amazing videos with this camera. Excellent quality, and very, very durable. 
25818 4 Got it on time. Has everything I need. Looks and works great on my bike. Great value for the price. Very happy! 
25819 4 Best 50mm lense ive used so far. Its really quite. Takes very sharp pictures, great addition to my Canon 70D! 
25820 4 This is a present to the world. 
25821 4 thanks!) 
25822 3 my nephew live it! thanx 
25823 3 Quality product, just as described. 
25824 4 Works great for small things to photograph. 
25825 4 I wanted something very minimal for a very small camera (Fujifilm X100 series), and this fits the bill perfectly. The swivels work as advertised - no more tangles! 
25826 4 love it! 
25827 4 Everything went ok with it ! 
25828 4 Works find for my 72 lens. for the price can t beat it. T 
25829 1 The 3 prongs are too tight, so it s really hard to get the camera in there. Also the plastic around the ball is really cheap and looks like it can break at any time. Overall not good. 
25830 4 A+ 
25831 4 Excellent backup to the provided fastener that came with my black rapid camera strap. Now I have a fastener for both if my camera bodies 
25832 4 Works great in my old 35mm cameras! 
25833 4 Love the colors 
25834 4 Good buy. Very happy with this. 
25835 3 Very sturdy and light weight. Easy to carry around 
25836 0 The glue was not sticking 
25837 1 A lot shorter and narrower than I expected 
25838 4 Great value for the money. Wonderful views of the skies. 
25839 4 i CANNOT BELIEVE HOW GOOD THE PICTURES ARE COMING OUT FOR A VERY MODERATE PRICE. 
25840 3 Great case for the price. Camera is a little loose in the case but the case will serve my purpose 
25841 3 Useful, really water resistant, not so good underwater color photos 
25842 2 It s good for the money. Wouldn t say it s 720. Also only 30fps, not 60. 
25843 4 Quickest shopping ever! Best camera ever! 
25844 1 These clips worked well when attacking the camera to them, but when clipping them to actual mounts (like gopros adhesive mounts, or a chesty) the clips were to tight and impossible to remove without breaking them. 
25845 4 Great tripod with smart phone mount! Good construction, easy to use, nice storage bag and lens cleaning cloth included. The low price and convenience of front door delivery makes this the deal of the year! I love it! 
25846 2 Great camera good clarity, never seen software with so many issues. Different results in different browser. Worked only on windows 7 
25847 4 This is my third case and I m more than happy with them. There is no better way to keep my photo gear protected, perfect for storage and travel, can t go wrong with this case, highly recommended! 
25848 4 LOVE LOVE LOVE! If you re still doubting, STOP and JUST PURCHASE! You won t regret it! 
25849 2 It s not exactly what I ve expected but it s ok for other uses. A little to much of a toy instead of a pro kit. 
25850 4 Works great. 
25851 4 Love-Love-Love this camera. It makes me feel like a real pro! This package deal was definitely unbeatable. 
25852 4 Great 
25853 4 Always buy factory batteries. The other brands are pretty poor. Great quality battery. 
25854 4 Nice product, quick delivery. This backpack does a great job of storing and protecting my Phantom 3. 
25855 4 This fit my hero 3+ underwater housing very well. 
25856 3 I don t really find the gorilla pod useful for my DSLR, it s not able to handle the weight. Note.. make sure your camera supports infrared snapshots unlike me. 
25857 4 Could be a hair larger, but does job for me...I stuff it with filters, and two to three old med format folders... 
25858 1 Rarely works. Sometimes I need to click continuously for two minutes until it works 
25859 4 For an older camera this one fits the bill nicely. great pictures and still has tons of attachments available. 
25860 4 I was displeased with the photo quality of GoPro cameras, and decided to try out a waterproof camera for snorkeling and shallow dives instead. I couldn t be happier - it takes phenomenal photos above and below water, and I have had no problems with leaking or humidity. 
25861 4 Son loves his case. 
25862 4 Great Lens! Beautiful pictures! Not a bad price for an L glass. 
25863 2 The camera runs down batteries really fast when doing any video. Tried using 2300 mah rechargeables worked a little better but still ran them down quickly 
25864 4 I am so in love with my new lense. It fits my camera and I can t wait to start shooting! Very excited ! Thank you! 
25865 4 Love this! Beautiful. Can t wait to get some awesome photos! 
25866 2 Pretty cheap and flimsy. Will do the job in a pinch, but I would not recommend buying it for a full camera. Maybe if you only wanted to use it for a small digital camera. 
25867 0 Broke on day 1 when used with a ful bag. Perhaps it s the bags fault (2nd strap to break off of this bag) but its now attached with carabiners. 
25868 4 tried it out, was as expected. a bit on the heavy, you ll need a good tripod. mine was a bit light. the tripod was great for heavy camera, but tripped over when I attached the Celestron. so now Im buying a tripod, enjoyed the Celestron view 
25869 2 It served as a replacement unit. 
25870 2 Works good. had to download 2cu app, but instructions suck. can it be viewed from a computer web browser using windows? No port information in manual. 
25871 4 Perfect fit for my Gopro hero 4, it is amazing that you don t need to carry your camera to capture the picture or video while your hand busy with other stuffs. I m definitely looking to buy other accessories for my Gopro. 
25872 4 this is a great kit at a great price...exactly what I was looking for. 
25873 4 Product was as advertised. 
25874 3 Depth 
25875 3 Downside is the screen is very small picture qulity prfect i like it. 
25876 4 I love that I can check in with my pups anytime. Also love that I get alerts to when there is motion and noise in certian areas. 
25877 4 Worked well. Held up to the salt water snorkeling and jumping into the water. 
25878 3 very good batteries. 
25879 4 Not one of these thing I ever cared to buy but I got tired of loading my ad cards or forgetting them in my pockets and sending them in the laundry. Case works great and is pretty solid. 
25880 3 Very nice, you can use it as a table cloth, curtain or camo cloth...I just don t use it much i have wall paper that looks similar and i dont need a stand or have to iron it but its good to have 
25881 4 Stronger material and stitching than I expected. 
25882 4 Just what I needed for my new camera........ 
25883 4 Great product. Exactly as described. Thanks. 
25884 3 The quality is adequate for the price. 
25885 4 This lenses everything I wanted. Clean and Chrix 
25886 4 So so so happy with the entire kit especially the camera. Was exactly what I needed and I m having to much fun with it! 
25887 4 Works well. Very happy with purchase. 
25888 3 Love the quality of light but wish it was more powerful. The charge is pretty poor too. I paid too much for this item but having said that I do use it regularly..... Just wish I had waited for the new one. 
25889 4 Good product good quality Very good seller 
25890 4 Easy to use, fit directly into d7100. The cons I see is that it can easily pop out of place. Good product 
25891 4 works fine 
25892 0 eh 
25893 4 My 17 year old daughter loves the features & smaller size of this camera. Great gift! 
25894 4 WORKS I THINK BETTER THAN THE GOPRO ONE 
25895 4 THIS IS MY SECOND ONE-----THE OLD ONE ( 4 YEARS OLD ), STILL WORKS GREAT, BUT I WANTED ANOTHER BEFORE IT BECOMES UNAVAILABLE. I HOOKED BOTH THE RECIEVER AND THE SENDER TO REMOTE X-FORMER SO I DON T NEED TO DEAL WITH REPLACEMENT BATTERIES. 
25896 3 Works great 
25897 4 Very easy to hook up brought 2 both took a total of 10 minutes to get working, finding place to plug in Cameras took the longest. Not a bad video image 
25898 4 Perfect ! 
25899 4 Grate 
25900 2 excellent item, very useful for whatever you want, 
25901 4 Very Good Product 
25902 0 The moment I plugged the charger + battery in, the circuits were tripped. I don t trust this product. I asked for a refund. 
25903 4 this POE NVR system is good constructed,nice package,NVR is real 1080P,cameras with nice image and POE function, real plug&play,no need more setting, when my monitor is on with this NVR, all the 4 channels are on also.very nice and price is also very good. 
25904 2 could be brighter 
25905 1 It drains the batteries to fast. 
25906 4 perfect 
25907 4 Perfect battery for my camera! 
25908 4 Works great! 
25909 0 In the ad they said it fit Leoca Q models however it is not 
25910 4 Great product 
25911 4 Everything was as I expected and works great. 
25912 4 Very nice case 
25913 4 Amazing product!! Very precisely cut glass for that perfect fit!! I was about to buy the screen protector that is much more expensive but I m glad I found this one. It s great value and fully protects my NEX-6 no problem. You won t regret it!! 
25914 3 Relatively easy to install the software which allows use, and the image generated is of reasonable quality (I am using to confirm authenticity of signatures and vintage documents). I would recommend this product. 
25915 4 Canon is great 
25916 4 This is a fabulous budget buy for umbrella s. Setup is minimal, and since they are used mostly indoor, I have no issues with wind, pets, children, etc. If you are just starting out with flash photography, you cannot go wrong with this setup. Highly recommend it. 
25917 4 good i like it but in night view it is not clear 
25918 2 Hard to install 
25919 4 This is a nice entry level tripod. The carrying case is a great touch. Perfect for the price! 
25920 0 It is too small for a regular camera -- probably works best with a smart phone. 
25921 4 works like a charm. I was having trouble hearing anyone at the door, and often found notes that someone had assumed no one was home. I get a lot of merchandise deliveries, and now know when someone just leaves a package without knocking. 
25922 3 Needed charger that works car. Works.as.advertised. 
25923 0 The product is crap. Don t buy it. Waste the $25 some place else.The tripod plate came apart the first time I touched it and is always loose. 
25924 3 It does the job, but honestly, I got better results as a point-and-shoot from my iPhone 4s. This camera is better for video, so there s that. 
25925 4 The spare battery and charger will likely never get much use, but it is reassuring to know that I have a spare battery, and the ability to recharge anytime independently of the camera. 
25926 4 cloths work very well 
25927 4 I absolutely love it! However, the instructions are entirely in Japanese. Wish me luck! 
25928 4 Awesome little camera! 
25929 4 Great product 
25930 4 excelente producto 
25931 3 A great variety of accessories for the money, including a solid carrying case. Great purchase for anyone with a GoPro. 
25932 3 I like it but I must return because I already was given a new system that I can use. 
25933 4 LOVE it... strong and strudy, durable, fits my 18-135 (with cam), and 50 mm and still have LOT of room with my canon D70 
25934 4 Very handy lights. I bought several, and I love the feature where you can attach them to one another to make a bigger,brighter light source! 
25935 4 While my Nikon CLS system will operate a remote flash with the pop up on camera flash in bright sunlight the cable is reliable. Works well and a very good price. 
25936 3 great product, but missing the camera strap in the packaging 
25937 4 Great battery arrived on time. 
25938 0 nothing special just basic low end lens 
25939 4 Insanely good image quality and bokeh. I was on the fence if I needed an 85mm for portrait work on my DX-format Nikon, but I m so glad I bought this. 
25940 4 We are happy with the system. 
25941 4 Fits the camera as expected. Reasonably priced and comfortable. All in all a good replacement for the 7D. I am considering ordering a spare as I live abroad and cannot get these delivered fast. 
25942 4 Wife loves it. She uses it at work for her evidence. Thanks. 
25943 4 Great camera! Clear photos and easy to use! 
25944 4 As advertised. Good quality and shipped quickly. 
25945 4 great 
25946 4 I received thisis a very timely manner. It works great! 
25947 0 After owning this for 3 months I can say the hours of tech support are not worth it. It is unreliable and finicky. If you are an advance tech person then buy it and enjoy your time troubleshooting. 
25948 4 Good camera for the quality and price. This IP camera is full of features and can become a real toy if you are a good player and try to get into all the functionality. 
25949 2 Case Logic 
25950 4 nice 
25951 4 Wife loves her new gift. Brings those far away shots right up where you want them in a nice clear display. Very nice. 
25952 4 Thank you 
25953 4 just have to manually positon this unit to the desire position. the plastic housing feels that it will break if not handle with care 
25954 3 Fits Mobius with no issues, just like one that came with camera. Bubble level good idea but nice if a bit thinner. 
25955 4 Great fit!! Perfect length. Not flimsy. Great buy. 
25956 4 For the price you can t go wrong. Takes a little bit of time to set up as it s universal but for the price it works pretty good. All the reflectors you ll need for any kind of ambient lighting on your outdoor portrait shoot. 
25957 4 👍👌 
25958 4 thanks 
25959 4 Perfect fit. Good feel. Can t even tell it s there. 
25960 2 Good investment, although be warned, the filters don t really do anything. Save your money for an Orion telescope. 
25961 0 Terrible product - cheap - couldn t get it off my lens after I installed it! 
25962 3 I was expecting a little more quality food on the camera (comes out grainy with no flash indoors even when well lit). But for the price this is a good camera. 
25963 4 This was a purchase for myself and I have found it as advertised and a good purchase. The seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with. 
25964 4 First carry-on case that s big enough to handle all I want to pack. I especially like the removable insert section that fits even in commuter jet overhead storage. That allows me to carry on the most fragile components, even when the outer shell has to be gate checked. 
25965 1 Nice at first but fell apart at the plastic joints after a year. pay a little more and get a better quality tripod. 
25966 4 Arrived quickly and complete. The converter for Europe will come in handy! 
25967 4 Very good value. A lot of bang for your buck. Very well made. Images are very clear. 
25968 4 I love the way it look and small enough to carry around 
25969 4 Great product. Fits just right, protects the screen and you don t even know it s there. 
25970 2 was ok just smaller than we imagined. It was true to advertisement. 
25971 2 it was ok 
25972 2 It had light leaks though 
25973 4 I have a lot of wrist issues and this really helps with support. I don t worry about dropping my camera now! Shoot with a Nikon D600 
25974 4 as expected 
25975 4 Inexpensive, fits well and secure, gives you some room for grip. It clears the battery trap but because of the extra 1/2 inch, you ll need to pinch the battery out. 
25976 4 Very happy with these lights. Powerful, they display the color temp in Kelvin, they don t get hot, and they can run off batteries. Excellent. 
25977 4 I use it at the shooting range and it holds pretty steady. The focal length adjuster is a little too tight for my liking but this monocle does it s job pretty well. I can easily see my shots at 25 yards. 
25978 0 Sorry not good, returned item 
25979 4 This works beautifully for supplementing natural light with more natural light. It is large and very efficient. 
25980 4 I bought the kit to use with my new GoPro on a trip to Florida and was very happy with performance and the quality of the items in the kit. It was a great alternative to the higher price accessories I am completely happy with kit and with the seller. 
25981 4 It fits g7x screen perfectly. 
25982 4 great buy 
25983 4 Good 
25984 4 Its great camera float to the top, Very pleased with it 
25985 4 Cute throw at least that is the purpose I used it for and this does the job. I put it on the back of my daughter s mod chair and she loves it. 
25986 4 The camera is wonderful and the company is amazing! 
25987 4 Exactly what I was looking for. 
25988 2 adequate 
25989 4 It works OK. 
25990 4 Lasts longer than generic 
25991 4 Bought for a friend and he likes it. 
25992 4 Great value, better than my expectations. These last as long as the originals. 
25993 4 Great quality and Great Price. 
25994 4 excelente 
25995 4 Show 
25996 4 Very lightweight and easy to grip. Just what I needed. 
25997 4 Great camera 
25998 4 The product met expectations. 
25999 4 Love the driveway alert doorbell, we actually use it for our apartment to know when someone is coming down our steps because we live in the rear of the building. 
26000 1 Can t tell yet. Camera arrived defective and had to be returned. 
26001 0 not easy to operate 
26002 4 This helps when I m playing paintball so I don t have a shiny camera on my helmet 
26003 2 Very heavy, clumsy. A sturdy base/light stand is needed--not a folding stand. 
26004 4 A great inexpensive filter. 
26005 4 Typical DJI quality. 
26006 3 Great product. Fits like a glove - almost too tight. Definitely protects the camera. Just a little work to get the camera in and out. 
26007 4 Fast shipping, great price! 
26008 3 It fits in very nicely with my new Hero 4 Silver. 
26009 3 Daughter loves it and takes her selfie stick everywhere. Everybody comments on how pretty the crystals are. Came fast and was a pleasure to buy from this seller. 
26010 1 If you want HD quality, don t get this. Sound wasn t great. Bought for a wedding and then a rock show, and was not impressed. Returning ASAP. 
26011 1 Pole grip moves and ended up ripping after about 6 months of use. GoPro s are suppose to withstand a any type of activity and weather and this did not. 
26012 3 It was what I expected. 
26013 1 Received in good time however the screen contrast is poor and quality not great. Price was good though so at least I can see the controls again! 
26014 3 Nice - works well - foam insert just a hair too small so it comes out easily. 
26015 4 Good stuff!! Quality aftermarket product. Pretty happy with my purchase. 
26016 3 good product. The format is AVI and doesn t work with I-Mac s unless you download a third party program that reads the AVI format 
26017 4 Good 
26018 4 great camera. read the instriuctions 
26019 0 heavy 
26020 0 Extremely bad picture quality. Not sure if it is just this particular camera but its pretty bad. I ll send it back 
26021 3 Only used this once. No start up instructions, finally figured it out. 
26022 4 Really like the clarity and features of the image and frame. Would recommend this brand to anyone! 
26023 4 Good as the OEM. No complaints. 
26024 4 Took this camera with me on recent trip. Great videos and photos. Easy to use. 
26025 0 batteries discharge VERY rapidly!! Nowhere as good as my orginal Sony batteries. 
26026 4 As described. Fast shipping. 
26027 4 Love it - use it everyday to monitor activities of my pets. 
26028 4 Excellent fit! No messing around with loose fitting connectors. 
26029 4 I fell in love with the quality and all of the tiny pockets. Such an awesome bag!!!!!! 
26030 4 I bought it to offer some protection for the lens on a Sony HDR-CX430V video camera. It s wide angle so the hood never shows in my video, which was a concern. 
26031 4 Thank you! 
26032 4 It is so cute and so well made. I love it! 
26033 0 This does not fit the a6000 properly. It is missing a lip at the front end to slide in, which causes it to protrude from the back. 
26034 4 love the product it fitted my xa20... 
26035 4 Ordered this for a friend after they saw the one I bought earlier for my home. Easy to setup and use. 
26036 1 Looks good but could not find 8gb sd card at all 
26037 4 Didn t sink that s forsure! thanks! haha 
26038 4 Camera is quite realistic. 
26039 4 Works great. Plug & play like an original cable release 
26040 3 The Canon brand batteries seem to last longer than the cheap copies. The only reason I didn t give it five stars is because of the price. 
26041 4 Nice case at a great price. Genuine Samsung product. 
26042 4 Cane right on tiem for my trip with my new waterproof camera ! I was concerned the thin string would pop and it didnt n it went through alot lol. Thanks again. 
26043 0 Used the mount on my mountain bike. After a few uses the tightening screw cracked. 
26044 4 Great product and super shipping. Thanks so much. 
26045 1 didn t work with my Alpha 77 / Alpha 65 camera i dont know what s wrong , maybe it s defective or maybe it s a battery issue , i have no idea 
26046 0 that wasn t working 
26047 4 Works great and the price was less than what we found locally 
26048 1 Does not have the extended end tabs that help you align it perfectly before touching it down. I missed badly when trying to position it. Wound up throwing it away. 
26049 4 Well made nice padding 
26050 4 A great upgrade to the f/1.8 version 
26051 2 Very Manual - It s fun to play around with, but I feel like you have to use a tripod because any movement you make will cause blur. It s very manual, but fun if you are just killing time and taking photos of birds. 
26052 4 Fine product, great service. 
26053 2 This came with zero information or instructions on how to use. I m trying to decide if I want to send it back. 
26054 4 Great kit! Fast shipping! And you can t beat the price! Nothing has broken yet! :) 
26055 4 Fast delivery and product is exactly as advertised. 
26056 1 I expected much better quality photos with 20.1 MP resolution. It could be that I relied too much on the &#34;Intelligent Auto Mode&#34;. Unfortunately my pictures turned out grainy and out of focus even when I used a prop to hold the camera still when shooting. 
26057 4 Works as advertised. Nice to get everything together, especially one charging block that can be plugged into the car charger or into a 110V outlet. 
26058 4 This was a purchase for myself and I have found it as advertised and a good purchase. The seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with. 
26059 3 Excellent 
26060 4 Great we love it! 
26061 2 Good,but not reliable,it works but not what I was expected 
26062 4 Great value. Good for someone without smartphone or tablet. 
26063 4 It s cool camera and amazing performance! I could take beautiful pictures and movies 25m depth under water. 
26064 4 Overall the product is very good for the price. I would definitely recommend this alarm. 
26065 3 Works fine. But the black len will be in the picture. 
26066 3 As advertised 
26067 3 Great camera for the price. Im using it more than my 18-55mm. 
26068 4 As advertised! Not a lot of experienced yet as how will it behave, but looks great and charged well so far. 
26069 4 No issues. 
26070 4 I was very happy with my X1 UV MRC4 77mm that I bought 67mm for another lens. 
26071 4 Great product. Extremely satisfied with it for the price. 
26072 4 Just what we needed when our other battery kept dying on vacay. Now we ll have a spare fully charged. 
26073 4 Too Much Stuff and not enough time to use it. 
26074 4 I got 2 of these for my girl and myself. They both worked great we had no issues. Thanks for the product! 
26075 2 Worked great until..... The ring that holds the lens in one of the pieces (macro) fell out, thus allowing the lens to come out of the mount :( 
26076 4 Exactly what I was looking for to replace my original Olympus C7AU that I lost in a move. Works perfectly. Great for when the camera is on a tripod because the battery compartment gets covered by the tripod attachment, which makes it annoying when batteries need changing. 
26077 4 We are using this as a baby monitor and it has been great. Only problem is that it used to send me notifications of movement, but it doesn t anymore, and I can t figure out why...but I still love it! 
26078 4 Sick case 
26079 4 Great product, thank you. 
26080 4 An inexpensive way to soften off-camera strobe. Does what it s supposed to do. Appears to be made well, especially for the price. 
26081 4 The mouth mount from Ho Stevie is an extremely comfortable mount!!! It is great for surfing. I would recommend this product to anyone that enjoys hands free videoing!!! 
26082 4 Works perfectly with my Canon EOS Rebel T3i, was easy to set up, and it s very easy to use. No complaints at all for this product, it s a pretty straightforward wireless remote control. I use it to start and stop recording for video wireless and it works great! 
26083 4 Items came in a good package. All items fit my Gopro very well. I will be buying another one with for the touch bacpac in the future 
26084 4 Just as described. I use this for shooting over babies as to not lose my grip. 
26085 4 I will keep this as a spare. 
26086 4 I love this case. It keeps anything smelly (cigars and the like) from stinking up my purse. I spray painted the lid white before using it so the contents wouldn t be easily visible. 
26087 4 I use them for the lake and football games. They are a excellent value a little long but they are manageable without the use of a tripod. Wish I had bought these sooner 
26088 4 Quick shipment and good value! 
26089 4 Cool price. It s republished but good work. I can access easily by internet & my smart phone. 
26090 4 Fits on the Nikon 7100d camera 
26091 0 Stopped working after 3 months. 
26092 4 fits perfect, very easy to use. I plan to purchase one for every lens I have. 
26093 4 Speedy delivery, chest strap holds camera in place when shooting video on motorcycle. Happy with product. 
26094 4 received the pen in only 2 days. looks very simple to use. charging now and going to use it right away. does not look cheaply made. and the pen even writes. 
26095 4 This was a present for my wife to replace the Cannon she has had for many years. She loves it and the great pictures she takes. 
26096 4 As its suppose to, it fits my lens. John 
26097 0 Only work once 
26098 4 Perfect love it 
26099 1 It scraped by lens body, leaving a permanent mark of scratch. 
26100 4 Just what i needed an extra charging cord. 
26101 4 Great surveillance system. Cheap but does the job perfectly. 
26102 4 It s well made and my service dog enjoys it 
26103 2 It is 1600mAh vs 1060 in the original battery, but the original battery is heavier and lasts longer. 
26104 4 Thanks, it was on time delivery and the pro woks well 
26105 1 the top part of the tripod where the go pro screws on broke off the first time i used it. the plastic just stright up broke. if it hadn t borken so easily the concept of the wraparound legs is great. 
26106 4 Fits camera great. No room for nothing else. 
26107 4 good color with light, good night vision with IR enabled. Never thought my families are so closer with me and it 
26108 2 hard to get on the computer 
26109 4 Hoya makes good filters for reasonable prices. This one is great for making longer exposures of outdoor subjects such as waterfalls. 
26110 4 Was an outstanding birthday gift at a fraction of the price you would find at a big box retailer store such as best buy 
26111 2 A little small 
26112 4 Just what I needed great 
26113 4 Awesome little bag especially for use around the house and short trips with cannon camera 
26114 3 good product 
26115 2 everything works great except WI-FI, luckily at my business it was easy to connect to modem by cable, which works better with no pause for movement,need better instructions and problem solving, still worth it. 
26116 0 Very crappy material. Won t last long. Poor Poor quality! It s also very light and the slightest bit of wind will have it down the street. 
26117 4 Perfect for football season. I m going to pick up some extras. 
26118 4 Works grest 
26119 4 Great price on this great lens for getting that long shot of birds. Plus the super fast next day delivery was amazing. Thanks big mikes great service and products. I m sure I will buy more products from you. 
26120 4 Excellent product!!! 
26121 4 This camera is great. Telephoto shots are amazing. Love everything about this camera and cannot beat the great price! It is everything I need for London. You need the extra battery. 
26122 4 Used this with my Action Cam 200 and was very impressed with it. Very versatile as well. 
26123 4 This Camera was a used replacement for an identical camera I already had and it is great. My favorite when it comes to picture taking, so much so that I will be ordering another before this one wears out like my old one did. 
26124 3 They work, but it took a buncha effort to make the lighting and everything work, and even after that I needed to Photoshop it. 
26125 4 Works just fine. No frills, just does exactly what it says on the tin. 
26126 2 as a battery grip its great. but after 1 month the connection port for the grips shutter button broke. 
26127 4 I love this selfie stick good quality pretty sturdy 
26128 4 My favorite camera bag thus far. IT has plenty of space for my sony alpha 600 and go pro 4 gear. It is stylish and rugged. I am extremely happy with this purchase :) 
26129 3 decent but not great 
26130 3 I love this camera, works great for business and personal use 
26131 2 Does the trick for the price. Bottom plastic pieces are weak. 
26132 4 Arrived ahead of schedule. Great price. Works well. 
26133 0 Piece of crap 
26134 4 Excellent cameras and buyer was also available for a question. 
26135 4 Fit exact to AW130 givin aditional scratch protection and a waterproof toy look 
26136 0 Cameras need a small magnet and if u lose it and the camera loses power u have no way to reset the camera leaving it worthless wouldn t recommend this product 
26137 4 Just one word...Excellent!!! 
26138 4 Excelent 
26139 0 I though can be pair with any smart phones,android including Nokia Lumia that s why I bought it. But won t be able to used it the Bluetooth doesn t work with my phone otherwise have to used the timer. Little bit Disappointed! 
26140 4 The item was better than i expected. The fact that it had 50mm objective lens, the &#34;resolution&#34; is awesome! Easier to work with than binoculars i.e focusing on the object, looking through the eye piece, etc. definitely recommend! 
26141 3 It seems OK, I have not as yet used it myself, but my son said it seems OK 
26142 4 Amazing 
26143 1 i was expecting at least the cd driver for it 
26144 4 Functions exactly as intended 
26145 4 excellent service and product 
26146 3 Over all so so product. You get what you pay for. For this price it is a good bag for normal rough usage. Plenty of pockets and space. I dont like the strap but you can always attach a better one. It arrived on time actually same day. 
26147 4 I love the flexibility. It s better than the tripods that don t bend. 
26148 4 great transaction. Product as described 
26149 4 It is incredible, also amazon has packed me very well the lens, in an excellent State lleog and besides having excellent optics lens. 
26150 1 Honestly, I wasn t expecting much. But the picture quality is not good. I am very disappointed. Battery life is horrible. Slow to respond. Flash has to charge and it takes a few seconds. Just all around not much bang for your buck. 
26151 4 Lov 
26152 4 Great value. Individually wrapped for convenience. 
26153 4 Meets all my expectations for my digital images!!! 
26154 3 Very good 
26155 4 Came as advertised. Sharp focus and easy to handle. 
26156 3 good for bikes but wont fit on bigger pipes, railings 
26157 4 Love Moose Peterson s polarizer - works & warms as it s supposed to- hoya has been around forever 
26158 4 Yet to use this bag but my Canon SX-520 and accessories fit in well. 
26159 4 It s great to have backup batteries for the camera. 
26160 4 They work great and they are a fantastic price. 
26161 4 Worked like a charm! 
26162 4 Finally got a deal on it. I had a 102 before and loved it. Gave it to my in law and get this one. It is big for sure. But same high quality as 102. 
26163 4 5 star, bigger than advertised- it is 9.5 x 6.5 x 3 inches- well padded, and easily holds my canon SX110 Is camera and a charger. 
26164 4 Just as described, on time delivery= happy customer! 
26165 4 I absolutely love this camera! It takes beautiful pictures. 
26166 3 Bought this for my husbands birthday. He loves it. Light. Easy to carry. Stable. 
26167 4 works great 
26168 4 I love this lens! Thanks so very much! 
26169 2 plastic feels okay not the best 
26170 1 Be nice if this actually fit. P3 s need a lot of cutting. Still does not fit correctly. Phantom sits way to high which is now prone to damage and controller does not fit. Not impresses. 
26171 0 False advertising as it said 1000tvl on the description. Never buy anything under 1000tvl! Huge picture difference from my experience. 
26172 4 Very nice lens for my Nikon Dd3100 
26173 4 Works great 
26174 4 The product is way more then I expected. 
26175 4 Fit very nicely and did what it was suppose to do. For the price, I def recommend this product! 
26176 0 SUCKS Sucks sucks sucks Don t waste your money. Can t even get it to work!!! Waste of time! 
26177 4 Shipping great. Perfect gift 
26178 4 Left our charger at home on our trip. Was able to order this and get it shipped to where we were staying. Werks perfets and was just what we needed with great shipping. 
26179 0 Did not meet expectation and returned for a refund 
26180 3 Very Good product , not bad at all , the hand grip is very short , that s the only down side for me thus far , it s not suited for huge Cameras , of course , other than that , works very Good for me :) 
26181 1 slow in charging. My Nikon chargers are twice as fast. With the power supply I still have two pieces except with this charger only one plug is needed 
26182 3 Bought this on a whim. There are many products. Would advise getting something which gives more control over white balance. The filters are not ideal The color tones on face is variable. Price is okay. 
26183 0 Item failed to work properly! 
26184 3 It mounts the nvd on the head. No need to give it the hose again. 
26185 0 I did devolution of this product... 
26186 4 Very nice. 
26187 3 I researched many types of home security solutions and Canary ended up being my choice. I m happy with what I ve received for my investment. 
26188 4 I love this camera!! Underwater and not even in water it gives really good HD quality. I really enjoy using it on all the adventures I have with my family! 
26189 4 I added an electronic dead bolt to my alarm system. This key fob turns off the alarm and unlocks my front door. Very handy when coming home with an arm load of grocery etc. 
26190 4 Worked as hoped for. Prompt delivery. Good price. Thanks a million. 
26191 4 I m very pleased with my product. I traveled for 15 days and not failed. I m very happy with my Selfie Bluetooth Shutter Wireless Remote Control. Thanks Noot. 
26192 4 Easy to install and the iPhone app is Fantastic. Been very happy for the last two months. 
26193 4 Little on the heavy side But good camera 
26194 4 So I ve been walking with this every morning and it makes me feel a bit safer. It s small enough I can hold it in my hand and love the chain I can wear on my neck when needed. Hopefully I will never have to use it! 
26195 3 works great. 
26196 3 No complaints with the product. FYI - it does not come with a memory card, you have to purchase one separately. I wish I had know ahead of time since this was a gift, and I could have purchased one at the same time of my original order. 
26197 4 I take it to water parks and rivers. It s taken a beating yet looks great and functions as expected. 
26198 4 Love this bag. It fit my camera perfectly, I love how it has so many different compartments and pockets to store all the accessories or gadgets I want to bring along with me. 
26199 4 Great way to go OTA and still be able to record favorite programs etc. 
26200 3 So far works for my needs. The apps need improvement. Four stars is due to long wait time for customer support 20min to an hour on average. Danny was very helpful in assisting me with the product set up. 
26201 3 good and cute camera. Very good quality photos, and pretty easy to use 
26202 4 This battery works like a charm. My first impressions were that it had a nice fit, very good power capacity, and works exactly like the OEM. I can t really tell the difference between this and my Canon battery. Good buy for a budget professional! 
26203 4 Works well and we used it underwater with no problem. 
26204 0 Poor quality. Not worth the money. 
26205 3 Camera works well.. in and out of the water. Was very pleased with this item 
26206 4 works very well with our GoPro Hero2 
26207 4 Fantastic, works great 
26208 3 it s alright 
26209 3 Very good 
26210 3 I ve been looking for this waterprrof action cam. This is very great! 
26211 4 Excellent product delivered on time. 
26212 0 It doesn t fit what it says it fits very clearly, did not fit my lenses and according to the info, it should have fit them. 
26213 4 Does the job 
26214 2 Ok little setup grief. Quality decent. Worth the $$$$ 
26215 0 The attachment strap unraveled after two uses. Don t count on it as a sole means of attaching anything to your wrist. 
26216 3 Smaller than I anticipated but I like that it can fold up easily for my camera bag. I was a little surprised it said that it expires in two years seeing as it costs a lot for a small item. I look forward to using it. 
26217 4 Quaity product as expected. 
26218 3 It does the job well. 
26219 4 My wife needed the hoods and lens cover, this kit provided all and more! Timely shipping, too. Thanks! 
26220 4 Love the props! 
26221 3 Cut and dry it s a great case, and is well made..does the job nicely... 
26222 4 Good so far for the price! 
26223 4 Great product, great value 
26224 2 Just ok but nothing great. Fisheye can be better. 
26225 4 These batteries seem to last slightly longer than the stock battery that came with my gopro hero 4. 
26226 4 I do a lot of kayak fishing and this works perfectly to keep my gopro safe and in view if I ever lose it. Definitely helps ease the mind in case I m clumsy or if it takes a dive. 
26227 3 This won t completely get rid of wind noise, but it will cut down on it considerably. 
26228 4 Works great. Love having the extra power. 
26229 0 DOA 
26230 3 Functional but wish there is a LCD screen to see what is being recorded. 
26231 4 It fits the camera and is basically like putting sunglasses on your lens. 
26232 3 Paired easily with SmartThings and works great. My only problem is you can t control the timeout reset. It s default is 4 minutes to reset as other reviewers have stated. You can change the jumpers to test mode and this allows it to reset as soon as motion stops. 
26233 3 It is not Hero but ;-))) 
26234 4 Great 
26235 4 Amazing manual focus wide angle. Super sharp and great color rendition. I use it on my D810 for long exposures. Would definitely recommend it if you don t need the autofocus. 
26236 0 User manual was the size of a stamp. Too much complicated for the user. 
26237 1 The bar looks great and sturdy with rollers inside to glide and slide. Unfortunately, it came today with a broken screw necessary for adjusting the tension for sliding. Pretty much an important piece... 
26238 4 Great price, very fast shipping. 
26239 4 What s not to like? A solid performer at a great price, you can t go wrong. 
26240 0 Received a Chinese PAL version of this camera, yeah, like THAT should even be sold to a US customer... Contacted Dahua support for assistance, they told me to go to the supplier for firmware.. First and last Dahua product I ll buy... 
26241 4 Works just as described, great option to buying OEM 
26242 2 This pair of binoculars performed adequately but the family much preferred the Pentax Marine Boat 8 x 25. The strap never functioned properly. 
26243 1 no as good as they said the wood be 
26244 4 This is my second DLink. And EVEN BETTER than the last one. I love the tilt and pan features. I highly recommend. But remember- if you are on a VPN from your company- turn it off to set this up. Speeds up the process! 
26245 4 they work 
26246 3 Works as described. The pinhole gives a very narrow view for playback. While recording one of the lights continues to flash, no car remote does that and its something that will bring attention to your undercover work. Putting your finger over it works 
26247 4 excellent quality and size, perfect for mirrorless camera! Looks so cute too. 
26248 4 My son asked for this along with a gorilla pod for Christmas for his Fuji camera and he loved it. 
26249 3 legs are no as stable.. ok for the cost range 
26250 4 Nice camera! 
26251 4 Awesome Flash at such a budget price. Features and controls are easy to access and ETTL worked just fine. 
26252 1 Film took too long to expose and pictures were not as clear as compared to old pack of real Polaroid Film. Would not buy again 
26253 4 If you need the size, you can t beat this case. Expensive, but well worth it when needing to protect something. 
26254 4 Great batteries, hopefully I wont need them anytime soon. These will be backups for one of my rifle optics. 
26255 4 Excellent quality and price point compared to other similar multi-mounts bars. The two end threads are 3/8&#34; only and not interchangeable, so just be aware. The two TOP threads are 1/4&#34; and 3/8&#34; interchangeable. 
26256 4 Fulfills all of my FPV needs. Highly recommend a Shade also... 
26257 4 Purchased for my wife as an extra safety when she has to walk to her car in the dark after she gets off work. A quick test showed it is good and loud - and will be one more thing to make here feel safer. 
26258 2 it doesn t show battery amount in a flip 
26259 3 Pack is amazing, Camera it self a good gadget 
26260 3 It s very roomy and versatile. 
26261 4 Ridiculously easy to set up. Everything works. I love it. 
26262 4 Good in all sense. 
26263 4 Very satisfied with the quality of the camera and zoom 
26264 4 Works well as expected! 
26265 3 Only sharp with ideal lighting. Other wise not so sharp. Save your money and buy a carl zeiss or l lens or 50mm f1.4 by canon. 
26266 2 Disappointed with the video quality but for the money what would you expect? It has now become my dash cam. 
26267 4 There is a lot of confusion regarding which props should be used on a P3. This listing, the information and shipping speed made all the problems go away. Just what I needed with a minimum of hassles. 
26268 4 Lot of softbox for the money...why complain about anything with value like this...I use a manfrotto umbrella adaptor to attach it with led panel...led sits up high but it works...the diffusion is fairly strong, but it s soft--clean light 
26269 4 This camera is perfect for capturing memories in picture and video form. We love it! 
26270 4 Very satisfied! Product as described! Charged my Nikon P330 camera battery completely. No complaints. 
26271 4 Great buy and it works very well. Recommend this product. 
26272 4 Worked great with my Foscam indoor to angle it out a window. 
26273 4 I mean... I THINK I ll love it as much as my mindshift 180 back-pack.... I m just waiting for some rain to test it out!? 
26274 4 This is my second pair.. bought them for my wife..excellent binoculars! 
26275 4 Perfect with the Celestron Skymaster 25X70 
26276 4 Great product Will be purchasing this again 
26277 4 works ok, it s a battery 
26278 4 Great bag. Have had it for years and it hardly shows any wear. Very versatile. 
26279 4 Outstanding image quality, excellent low light capabilities producing minimum noise, compact but powerful. Incorporates many features normally found in mid to high level DSLRs, three video formats producing high quality 1080 HD video. However, due in large part to the camera s extensive functionality, it is somewhat complex and complicated. 
26280 4 Great product and less cost than Nikon. 
26281 4 This works well. 
26282 2 Great 
26283 2 worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks. 
26284 2 Not sturdy. Just OK for a very light camera! 
26285 2 Worked great for about a month until it randomly broke. Very upset about this product. It would have been a great product had it actually been reliable and not easily breakable. 
26286 4 Perfect 
26287 4 Great Kit, lots of extra items that I don t have to purchase separately. 
26288 4 I love the camera Lafavre camera in the world 
26289 2 SD Memory card slot not working had to send it back. Got a new one that worked 
26290 4 Eccellent 
26291 3 Great Product 
26292 4 Excellent use on motorcycle. Good quality already dropped them and it didn t even phase them and the recording ability...tough and durable 
26293 0 Extremely poor quality, Lens covered with scratches, would not recommend. 
26294 3 Works good 
26295 4 Works 
26296 4 This is a neat little gadget - surprisingly effective and dirt simple to use. A lot of bang for the buck. Should be fun for you kids or grandkids, but also useful for an adult as well. Provides detail well beyond that visible with a magnifying glass. 
26297 2 I find that is diffuses the flash more than it softens it. for the price it is great, but does not produce soft box quality 
26298 4 VERY Nice Product and Shipped even Faster that Promised! Thank you! Its a Plus that this cable has fittings attached..Great Quality Product! 
26299 4 Creates a great curve for close objects but back up a few steps and you just get the world around your subject.. 
26300 3 nice priced small camera 
26301 3 Clear pictures and great value. Night vision mode reflects the IR light off the window pane and washes out the picture. I m sure there is a solution to remedy this issue, but haven t had the time to look. 
26302 4 Super fun! Take it every where! 
26303 3 great light 
26304 4 I get compliments on this case all the time. I m glad I purchased it. It looks so classy. 
26305 4 Fantastic case. Fits the camera perfectly and very nicely made. I highly recommend it!! 
26306 4 Less expensive allowed me to buy two for the price of one gopro battery. 
26307 4 Not sure if it s a knock off, came in a package labeled gopro, took about 5 min to change and it s like the damage never happened 
26308 4 as described, no issues 
26309 4 The camera not only has the good quality,but also offer the best services,besides the price of the product is reasonable. 
26310 4 This little camera is so much fun and my daughter has absolutely loved using it. It takes decent pictures, is quick, and easy to operate. Lots of fun to have with this! 
26311 4 Great product. Easy to insert and takes great photo s! 
26312 4 Perfect for use 
26313 0 This does not work with my T3i, they said that T3i and 600D are the same... this is not correct. this does not turn on my camera with the batteries or even the Li-po batteries 
26314 4 Very pleased. Great price, quick shipping. 
26315 4 Is exactly what I need. It fits perfectly on my fuji x-t1. Highly recommend it to fuji x-t1 owner. Great product! 
26316 4 Works great, now my youngest son thinks it s his camera and gets greatly offended when we try to take it back. Bobber does exactly as intended, let the big kids go down slides holding it and taking fun videos and don t have to worry about the camera disappearing. 
26317 0 It didn t work so i returned it. refund was back on card before it even made it back to rma site. Thank you 
26318 4 Golf product 
26319 4 Very good,I likes it..... 
26320 1 A total Waste of $money$ for anyone who cares to not get ripped off. They are playing with your imagination by marketing this product as worth the savings. Flat out lies. Cant say you weren t warned here first. Good Luck 
26321 4 All of the accessories are great. I tried all of them on the day the camera was received. Great! 
26322 4 Great mirrorless digital canera 
26323 4 works good 
26324 4 we use these in our beach condo. perfect for dolphin watching 
26325 4 This tripod is exactly what I wanted. The legs can be moved but securely hold their position. Besides that, it is very stylish looking:) 
26326 4 Works great 
26327 4 nice, even have a you-tube video to tell you how to use it 
26328 0 Does not fit pictinnay rail as it should but nothing a few zip ties couldn t fix. 
26329 1 THESE ARE REAL CHEEP , BATTERY SWITCH DOES NOT WORK , THEY DO LOOK REAL 
26330 3 I carry it with me as a spare in case the one I usually use meets with misfortune. It has a lot of useful features. 
26331 3 Quality is good and quick delivery. 
26332 4 It s a nice little protector of the elements. 
26333 4 Just as described. Received very timely. 
26334 4 Great strap. Very happy with this purchase. Now I can wear my camera across my body, so my neck does not get sore. 
26335 4 I received this device free-of-charge for the purpose of testing and publishing this review (Netgear s Friends and Family program). It s a beautiful product and very easy to setup and config. I like it! 
26336 1 Bought the camera and it seems like its well made. Called customer service; they are a joke. 44 minutes on hold. overseas &quot;specialist&quot; had the nerve to tell me that it was past their closing time and told me to call back tomorrow. Unbelievable. Their customer service is a joke....... 
26337 4 Excellent both in value and quick delivery. The six pack is perfect for purse and traveling. I use for my readers, IPad, IPhone and flat screen TV s. Washable as well with just water. 
26338 3 Quality is Meh, but it works well. This particular one is extremely difficult to attach to the pelican lid, as your screwdriver must reach the screw THROUGH the mesh pockets. If that sounds dumb, it is. I wouldn t have a pelican without this, but the design is lacking. 
26339 4 Ready to use straight from the box 
26340 0 Photos and description of the product led me to believe this timer had connectors for multiple camera types. It does not. The pictures show an interchangeable connector. The model I received does not. It will only work with one of my cameras. Very disappointed! 
26341 3 The tripod holds my Nikon camera pretty well. It s not as sturdy as I imagined it would be but if you re on a budget it ll do the job! 
26342 4 Seems to be of very high quality and screwed into my 18-135mm Canon lens without fuss. Clarity is perfect, and, protects the front lens as well as reducing UV light. 
26343 0 I couldn t get them to work. 
26344 4 Great price!!! 
26345 4 Excellent product 
26346 0 Cheap in price and in quality. The cameras did not last even a year. It is better to pay a bit more and get a quality product. SHould have known when the warranty is only for 3 months. 
26347 4 is so nice... good quality 
26348 4 Really nice camera for the price. I did not need the WiFi feature of the GoPro so this was a great alternative. 
26349 4 Good fit and made especially for my lens 
26350 4 Very good! 
26351 4 Good Deal! 
26352 0 These brackets are poorly made! The swivel mechanism does not hold the camera securely in place. Therefore the camera will just hang loosely! Save your money and buy better quality brackets from Netgear! 
26353 4 Use it to mount 80X spotting scope at the shooting range. Very stable with sturdy legs. Would recommend for spotting scopes and cameras. Well built tripod. 
26354 4 All I can say that this is the best filter case I have ever came across....It s padded well, and made well....I highly recommend this case to everyone... 
26355 4 Great! I use this often, it comes in handy when I need to bring only some of my equipment. 
26356 4 Henry assisted me in installing my app for foscam,the cameras are easy to set up and customer service was great. 
26357 4 Excellent higher quality selfie-stick - it s worth paying a few extra dollars. It clamps your cell phone firmly in place and is fully adjustable for length, camera angle, etc. I have only used it with my phone but it also has an attachment to secure a digital camera. 
26358 4 Great for Mid Size Camera and Enough storage Great Protection Just What I needed 
26359 4 Bien 
26360 2 I m still a novice, so I don t really know what this is used for. The product is ok, but, I ordered the wrong size. 
26361 4 I have used this so far in my pool. and it works fine Has a nive grip on on it , that doesn t hold water .. Feels like this will hold up for a long time 
26362 4 I love them! 
26363 4 So far they are working good. Holds a charge well 
26364 0 Glass was warped so it wouldn t seal about 3/4&#34; edge on one side. 
26365 4 This little camera fits in a shirt pocket so it is easy to take on a hike in the woods or anywhere else. 
26366 4 This case works great. It has pockets and compartments useful for all my gear. it even came with a cleaning cloth. 
26367 4 Customer service is great, and the product really sucks (to the thing you want it to.) Comes with a tether too for piece of mind for all those times you mount it to a moving vehicle (the entire reason I bought it) 
26368 0 The only Camara I have ever bought, over 20, that didn t come with a lense cap?!? Camera does NOT shoot RAW even though the listing says it does. 
26369 2 The tripod is flimsy, and the bag has an ugly logo affixed to it. But for the price I got what I paid for; the little SD card transfer thingie is definitely nice to have. 
26370 4 Fujifilm manufactured battery that is identical in appearance to the one supplied with the camera. Expensive (as are all OEM batteries) but expect it to last the course unlike a lot of the third party cheaper substitutes. 
26371 4 Very good 
26372 4 Came quickly and appear to be good quality. Will see as I use them 
26373 2 Good optics but heavy to hold long and hard to hold steady enough to prevent visual blurring. Should stick with the seven power. 
26374 4 These are just handy to have 
26375 4 Easy to use. Can attach to stands or hand hold. 
26376 2 resolution has alittle to be desired but functioned as descibed 
26377 4 A great bag to protect our Canon, with extra pockets for misc. 
26378 4 Perfect product! Nice price! Fast delivery! 
26379 3 Sturdy and works as advertised. Definitely not something to get though if you re looking for portability. 
26380 4 prefect size for a work desk! 
26381 2 The idea for this product is great, but the rotating peg comes off its base pretty easily. 
26382 4 I love the case. It came on time and it is perfect for my Fuji mini 8 camera! 
26383 4 working well as expected for 960h 
26384 1 Bought this item TWICE. First time one of the light fixtures would not work. Second time, was shorted the 2nd LED light bulb. Purchased to take pictures of product to sell online. Workspace is a little small, but takes up a LOT of room to set up. 
26385 4 Great product, great price and delivered on time. What is not to like. Highly recommended. This got here before the camera so I had the batteries all charged up ready for my camera which arrived the next day. 
26386 4 as described 
26387 4 Quality is good. It is tough to steam the wrinkles out of the fabric, but when used with good lighting and wrinkle free chromakey works perfectly. 
26388 4 Great product for the pric Ipurchased this camera for my 10 yr old daughter and she absolutely loves it. It takes good quality pictures and is easy to use. 
26389 4 Love this lens! 
26390 4 Outstanding!! 
26391 4 I love that little camera. It is amazing, and would ve been so at twice the price! 
26392 1 The boom is great, the clamp is great, the height of the stand sucks if I plan to use it to hold my hair light. It just doesn t go high enough. Until I find a taller stand, I m relegating this setup to who knows what. 
26393 4 Excelente. 
26394 0 Doesn t record when plugged in. It only recorded in 20-minute segments and the battery doesn t past long even after it has been fully charged. Don t waste your time and money on this. 
26395 4 Great!! 
26396 3 awesome slider, would ve gotten the full 5 stars if it was able to mount up to a tripod. but for this price you cant beat it! awesome for the type of shooting that i m doing which is car meets! 
26397 1 Not bad but not that good.... =) 
26398 0 very difficult to be used. I bought it for my father and he dosn t use it at all, because is very tricky. I will I can return. Not a good product. 
26399 4 I love this camera, I had it for a few months now and I keep discovering new things. The pictures this takes are beautiful! This is my first DSLR and I couldn t be more pleased. 
26400 4 It s a Canon. 
26401 4 Very good baby cam/security cam! Setup is a breeze, and picture quality is awesome 
26402 4 Super tough strength holding my cabinet in place. Easy to install but remember the two white wires coming from the front of the unit are not needed unless you are using an alarm system and want to be notified when the door is open. 
26403 4 works great 
26404 4 This is for Canon new FD mount. Old Canon mount with breech lock can mount, but it cannot lock properly. As a result, the aperture control does not work for breech lock lenses. 
26405 4 Does the job. Package arrived quickly. 
26406 2 works as expected. The chromium finish fades/scratches after some use though. 
26407 3 Bought this to use as decor for a friend s apartment (she s a film student) For anyone using it for actual productions, you ll probably have to superglue the magnets on the inside of the clapper, mine came falling out. 
26408 0 This product does not work with nikon d3300. After I plugged it into the camera, the camera will not power up. I checked the nikon battery EN-EL14a states 7.2 V, 1230mAh. This charger states 9V, 5A. You have been warned. 
26409 4 Excellent product. A must for anyone who owns a BMPCC! 
26410 4 Works great!!!! 
26411 2 Great feeling grip, batteries do their thing...but after a few days of shooting, the shutter button on the grip stopped working. It will work half-shutter, but not full. Will have to return for a fix... UPDATE: I just slapped it, and it started working again 
26412 4 great system 
26413 4 Fits perfect no problems at all. 
26414 4 Great product and arrived on time 
26415 4 Loved it and would recommend it. 
26416 0 Cheap and not at all like the photo. Looks like a sheet that someone tried to clean a paintbrush on with blue paint on it. Sucks, 
26417 4 This item arrived exactly as it was suppose to ! The lenses are great! Takes creativity to a new level ! 
26418 4 Thanks for the items, very fast delivery. 
26419 4 So hard to find 35MM film now, however, I still appreciate the quality of film. Digital is great, but I believe there is still a place for film - particularly with fine art. 
26420 0 I did not like we can use to many problem with installation 
26421 4 I think it is excellent for the price. Not super duty but will get the job done. For balance it is best to align the lights with one of the legs. I plan to lengthen the legs 5 or 6 inches with 1/2 inch aluminum rod for better stability. 
26422 1 The two batteries simply doesn t work! My Lumix 5 doesn t recognise it. Charger is fine. 
26423 4 Very Good. 
26424 0 never worked! 
26425 4 Makes everyone look beautiful 
26426 4 what do you say about batteries and a charger other than they work? 
26427 2 it s ok 
26428 4 Film was great! 
26429 0 USELESS! 
26430 2 So far its decent. No leaks. The remote function (connect to phone app) doesnt work. Color is lacking. But not bad for the price. 
26431 3 Nice case and set up for camera. Its a bit pricey is why I only have it 4 stars 
26432 4 Been in use for years with 0 issues whatsoever. Even beating the hell out of it on ATVs, swimming at the beach with it, etc. 
26433 3 Tons of parts all work great! Broke a bolt trying to fit it through some pieces are tight and case is floppy. Not as sturdy as i expected 
26434 3 Not excelent quality but very useful. 
26435 4 😀 
26436 0 Crooked, won t seat straight. I have another soft release that will. So, yeah. Not great. 
26437 4 Excellent 
26438 0 too small and broke immediately 
26439 4 The resolution is good; sometimes I connected it with my pc. It can be mounted on a wall, or dash or wherever too, and it has a screw to tighten it at that angle for good viewing. 
26440 4 Very useful. Thx. 
26441 4 Works great thank goodness it s all metal unlike some other items I ve ordered 
26442 4 Perfect 
26443 4 Nice Product 
26444 0 No memory card , no reader, used battery, mismatched case, No instructions, no tripod, Camera seems used also 
26445 4 Works as advertised, I love it 
26446 3 Perfect size and quality product!! 
26447 1 Tried this as a replacement for my broken latch, this one broke within a week. 
26448 0 Can t get it smooth. It s like cardboard 
26449 4 The charger supplied with my new Fuji X-T1 uses a full size power cord, taking up way too much space in my camera bag. This one is much smaller and can be plugged into A USB Charger. Works great at a very good price. Recommended. 
26450 4 Quality and Good Price! 
26451 3 Works great! I use this for my Canon 5D Mark II all the time for film production. Doesn t last as long as a Canon battery of course, but does the job perfectly! 
26452 3 Fun Item, but GPS is not working properly 
26453 4 I loved that I bought this combo in less than a week I already finished the pack but I had some amazing pics instantly 
26454 4 works great with my 67mm lens. 
26455 4 Price was very good. 
26456 3 book needs a lot of work. We are not all professionals. 
26457 1 Excellent picture on the two I purchased, but one of them stopped working after two days 
26458 4 A gift and she truly loves it. 
26459 4 Jest what I wanted 
26460 4 They are so awesome! I will order as soon as they are gone, Great value and great items! 
26461 4 Hands free, comfortable, well made. I fits me well- 5-11, 195 lbs. I just hiked half dome and wish I had this, I couldn t film the cable climb because I needed both hands and didn t trust my head mount. I highly recommend. 
26462 0 It seems hard plastic , but glue use to keep the pole falls apart out of the box, i needed to use epoxy to put it back together again in the first try 
26463 4 Good price 
26464 2 Fits well but scratches easily! Better products out there! 
26465 0 Battery does not last.never used but no power after 1 month.original gossen pro meter battery lasted many years. 
26466 2 the up/down swivel does not work on the product i received. The product also does not come with instructions. So you have to guess which knobs to tighten and which latches do what. 
26467 4 Lets me use 77mm filters on my A6000 s kit lens. Thanks for making this in this odd size! 
26468 4 For the price you pay for this it s an awesome product. Here s a link to my personal test. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xbO0BYp2qk&sns=em 
26469 4 Easy to use, Not big for travel, good quality picture 
26470 4 thank you 
26471 2 Its ok for the price 
26472 4 This works great. Glad I got it for my NexStar 4 
26473 4 I Love it.. cant wait to start taking pictures!! Thanks 
26474 4 Excellent, as described in the publication I received, the delivery was fast without mishap, satisfied 100% 
26475 4 Just as described and quick shipping. 
26476 4 Works like a charm. Lost the charger this fits and works 
26477 4 Quality is great! 
26478 4 Good Value for the price. i like the texture of the bag. 
26479 4 It was fast I received my pen before Sept 10th I love this thank you 
26480 4 like the cameras alot, did need the tech support it was very helpful.thank you terry morgan 
26481 4 Works well! 
26482 0 No good doesn t work 
26483 0 did not detect motion outside, even if it did the sound was to low 
26484 2 I don t like typing 
26485 4 This item was replacement for a damaged screen. 
26486 4 Attached to my selfie stick for my gopro. Floats work great, easy to attach, and when tested, didn t even get close to letting the stick sink. 
26487 4 i love it! perfect size and everything! and the film doesnt cost too much either. i chose the free standard shipping and it took like a week and a few days to come but other than that it is great! 
26488 4 very nice i like it ! 
26489 3 powers the equipment I bought it for 
26490 0 Had to return product - did not work. 
26491 4 Worked out. 
26492 1 It is kinda expensive for only 10 but it came really fast 
26493 4 Great camera takes great pictures. I have to say I was influenced by all those Ashton Kutcher commercials. A really great value ! 
26494 0 Didn t hold a charge 
26495 0 No where in the description does it say refurbished. Guess what I received? A refurb. No paperwork. No instructions. Nothing. Its going right back out today. 
26496 4 Works great. 
26497 4 Reliable mount at an affordable price! 
26498 3 Durable. The middle insert that raises will sway if not held, so u need a shutter release to use it that high. Other than that, I m happy with the tripod. 
26499 4 perfect. 
26500 4 Very happy with this item. Would recommend to friends. And to the people who gave it a negative review, if you re looking for thousand dollar results,,,,buy a thousand dollar system! I am extremely happy with all functions of this system! Arrived before scheduled delivery date, works great! 
26501 4 I connected this camera to my phone and Wifi very easily. Very clear picture. 
26502 4 yup 
26503 0 works ok, but you can not use it with a tripod unless you anchor the bottom with a rubberband. That is what I did and it works pretty good. 
26504 4 I bought this for my husband who had all his go-pro stuff strung out all over the house to try to get it in one place. I was very impressed with the quality and it really does hold a lot of go-pro accessories. 
26505 4 It purchased for a friend and he is really enjoying the quality of the pictures this lens takes. 
26506 4 Nice glass! I m happy with my purchase. 
26507 3 This little camera is lightweight, takes great pictures and is very reliable. 
26508 4 Hi- Haven t used mine yet, but bought on the strong recommendation of my Marine Science major / scuba diver son and West Marine in Santa Barbara Harbor, who sells them but did not have the color I wanted. 
26509 0 What a scam plz read the fine print before buying 
26510 4 Excellent lens. Works well with my Nikon d3200. 
26511 4 perfect 
26512 4 The cost is great. 
26513 4 The seller sent out the camera really fast. My two kids took no time to put it together and learned how to take the videos and photos. The camera looks nice, compact, and well made. Look forward to using it in our upcoming trip. Thanks. 
26514 4 exactly what i purchased 
26515 4 Perfect 
26516 4 I love this lense. I am not a pro but I think this is a great lense. 
26517 4 What i expected 
26518 4 The product arrived quickly and within the time frame that was given. Everything was in clean working order and worked great for the shoot I needed them for. Thank you! 
26519 3 Fantastic,easy to install 
26520 4 Item is as described. Works great. 
26521 3 This is a great entry level camera. I received it sooner than I was told (a big plus) and with everything listed. As a newbie to DSLR cameras, I m really glad it came with the book. I d recommend getting an extra battery. 
26522 4 Thin and light but appear very strong - easy setup with just about any standard camera strap from thin to wide. 
26523 3 Very nice camera for my daughter 
26524 4 Perfect! Highly Recommended ☺ 5 ★ STARS ★ Thanks! A+ 
26525 4 Does the job. 
26526 4 Great security item for my yard 
26527 4 Just got back from a vacation that included Yosemitie National Park and Sanfrancisco. Great Photos, and still learning how to take advantage of this great lens. Make sure your tripod can handle this glass lens. 
26528 2 It s ok. I m looking into getting another battery with a larger mAh capacity. The trick is to make sure all batteries are fully powered before leaving for an event. 
26529 4 Loved this backpack and the color. I took it on my month long trip to Europe and now Puerto Rico. Great quality! 
26530 4 Great purchase! Perfect for anyone that does outdoor activities! Good to have the lcd screen to playback footage! 
26531 4 Excellent quality for this size camera! I use it in my classroom...the students enjoy capturing important moments. Bought one for my grandson with the camera case, and he loves using it as well. Great camera for the price. 
26532 4 Absolutely love this background. 
26533 4 Awesome product and gives much needed rigidity to the cameras frame. Would highly recommend this to anyone shooting with the sony A7 line. 
26534 4 Perfect fit 
26535 4 great locking holder 
26536 4 excellent product, arrived on time, works great. i would purchase from this merchant again.very happy with this product, would recommend it to friends. 
26537 4 Just as good as the factory original. 
26538 4 Great price on a multicoated filter to protect my lens. 
26539 2 I bought 2 batteries. 1 battery holds average charge for 1600 mAh for about 1.5 hours, another just half of that. 
26540 2 I use it as binoculars for which it is ok, not enough power for star gazing 
26541 4 I installed this system very quickly. The setup instructions could be a little clearer to understand but what s there is adequate. the system performs as advertised. I would have liked the master unit support wireless between it and modem. Other than that the system performs very nicely. 
26542 4 The products are awsome. The cases are very nice and protect a lot the filter and close-up lenses. 
26543 1 Couldn t get it to work with my system. Don t know if it was a problem with the product or just compatibility issues. 
26544 4 Was very impressed with this case. It will definitely protect the camera. The slinged holder also will absorb any bumps if it should happen. The light weight also is a great plus. Would definitely recommend to a friend. 
26545 4 Flawless. 
26546 3 good fit for camera. 
26547 4 Awesome POV! Camera is easy to access and out of the way! 
26548 4 Henry, he is Professional tech, he help me to set up the camera. 
26549 4 Product was exactly as described. Product delivered on time. 
26550 4 So much good and fun footage... check it out on youtube as 5280sky Enjoy!! 
26551 4 Love this camdera and love the price. Still learning all the features. Happy so far. 
26552 4 I got my case quickly and it was exactly what I wanted. 
26553 4 great quality. works well with screen cleaners/sprays. 
26554 0 Looks pretty, but it comes folded in a small envelope. It is basically the material of a thick shower curtain and I was not able to get rid of the fold creases. 
26555 4 Extra duration and less dollars is an excellent combination. This battery is more fragile than sony so I recommend you be careful when carrying it and keeping stored. Also works fine with neewer and yongnuo led lights 
26556 0 Applicator would not release from the film making it impossible to apply without creating air bubbles. Product arrived much sooner than predicted and was properly packaged. 
26557 4 One easy to use camera, great size, the zoom is more than great. Try it you won t be disappointed 
26558 4 Battery arrived promptly and works as expected. 
26559 2 Bad apps. Two way sound is poor quality. 
26560 4 Better than the ones with rubber band 
26561 4 Great product 
26562 4 Love Wasabi Power. They just know how to get it done. Works perfectly for my GoPro Hero 4 Black just like the OEM from GoPro but half the price. Get this, it s a no brainer. 
26563 4 Arrived on time, great film 
26564 4 Excellent quality as expected. Used to view archery competition and needed to be able to see fine detail. Bright and clear with little to no eye fatigue with long periods of continuous viewing. Used bi-pod support which I highly recommend with this power level. 
26565 4 Great! 
26566 3 This product is very good for those who are amateurs in Gopro film 
26567 4 great bundle! great compact camera! can t put it down. 
26568 4 Great grip for vertical photos without adding a lot of weight. 
26569 4 it works 
26570 4 I like it 
26571 0 instructions are microscopic and in very poor english. its being used as a real clothes hook because i dont want to throw it out 
26572 1 the charger worked great but the batteries do not work at all 
26573 3 So far so good! The burned smell really kills it though... 
26574 4 the best 
26575 4 Best deal online, was well packaged. Fast delivery, so far all of the pictures came out great, have not had any blanks or problems with the film. 
26576 4 Great product and prompt shipment! Thanks!! 
26577 4 Quality camera at a nice price. I bought the wide-angle for my quadcopter. Will get another Mobius soon with the original lens for everyday use. Very easy to use and quality video! 
26578 2 As others have noted, slides keep getting stuck inside and have to be removed with tweezers. Since that is the only moving part, I had hoped that they would have solved the problem. They have not. 
26579 0 Piece of junk. Shifts on it own. Lenses loose. Rattles. 
26580 2 Picture is OK. I would spend the little more and get the 1000tvl. That s what I did and I m very happy with the higher quality picture. 
26581 4 works just as stated 
26582 0 still trying to install instructions are useless. not very happy. may return 
26583 4 The kit has really everything I need to capture a video in any situation, very useful and complete. Excellent product. 
26584 4 Used this for a macro lens conversion and it worked perfectly. 
26585 4 Love it! awesome camera with awesome quality of video and also can make awesome stills! 
26586 1 It came with an old leaking battery, I had to buy a battery in order to start using it. 
26587 3 Very good to see camera screen clearly on daylight. 
26588 4 Very satisfied with the delivery and quality of the product. 
26589 4 Works great with the kit lens for my Nikon D7000. Highly recommended! 
26590 4 Works great. A real time saver. But as others have mentioned, it s loose so a little masking tape to shim it out is necessary 
26591 4 Great product for a great price. Thanks again. 
26592 3 Works well, not really great for dark objects though. 
26593 4 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AX12XTC/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_11 
26594 2 The case itself is very nice. But the interior foam does not last long. it falls apart, fragments. If you re going to be using it frequently, consider getting hard foam for this case. 
26595 4 Awesome awesome awesome charger for my digital camera, absolutely love it and the replacement batteries work just as good as the originals!!! 
26596 4 c6722085 tech ar004273 Henry Thank you, my tech was great in helping me set up my new camera! 
26597 4 All good. 
26598 2 It works but not very easy to use. 
26599 4 Fits perfectly. 
26600 0 bad bad bad product , do not buy , is of very poor quality , lost my money , see the photo. 
26601 3 good 
26602 0 Don t buy this battery, it s a waste of money, loses battery life very quickly, It is a fake battery, so don t bother buying from this user. 
26603 4 ok 
26604 4 Took a minute to get used to......love the old school! 
26605 4 Prompt delivery. Work great. 
26606 4 These work very well. You can get a tone when door or window is opened, set them to alarm when away and even get the temperature graphed out for a day, week, month or year. Cool. These are only $15.00 at Lowes though. 
26607 3 Lens itself works like a charm and pictures are sharp and nice, but mount does not lock to my 400D. 
26608 4 Very good 
26609 4 works good 
26610 4 It was a good buy for my GoPro Hero4 
26611 4 These Wasabi batteries hold power just like the original Olympus battery and the charger has an integrated plug unlike the one Olympus provides (i.e. no need to carry a power cord). After 6 months of use I have nothing to complain about. 
26612 4 great camera with a really good zoom 
26613 3 Great product water tight, but WIFI button can t turn off or turn on while camera is in case 
26614 4 Bought this as a starter camera for a teenage film student. He s able to use all the functions easily. Takes great footage indoors and out. Also got him the Ultimate Accessory Kit to go with it and he s loving it all. 
26615 0 main connector to the camera broke in 10 seconds. do not buy this poorly built device 
26616 4 Sometimes a generic battery works, but I prefer to buy the Nikon battery for more assurance of durability and lasting power. I always carry an extra for extended photo shoots. 
26617 1 They are not as clear as my other D-Link set and the sound is terrible. 
26618 4 great product- smart design! 
26619 4 Excellent glasses for birding. Light weight, easy to hold on image without shake.... Can t imagine spending any more for good field glasses. 
26620 4 Great case and great service! 
26621 4 Got here in a day and and a half, great shipping, and... it s a battery..? Lol. Going on a trip in September so I ll test it s limitations then. 
26622 4 These batteries are, so far, performing every bit as good as the &#34;brand&#34; batteries that I have bought in the past at 4 times the cost. They are definitely a good deal. 
26623 4 We live in a zone where there are gangs that love to graffiti in our alley and on our house and inside the carport. Since I have installed these and sings, there has not been any graffiti. Very happy. 
26624 4 Wonderful product!!! they give you a lot of product for a cheap price. It worked instantly for all of my lens s. I recommend these! 
26625 4 Nice and good for gopro. Is very easy to fit all the accessories and the camera 
26626 4 It works as it should! 
26627 0 The camera image is blurry and is very slow in capturing motion, a sometimes I am not able to look at image because camera image was all black 
26628 3 Works as advertised. Great for vacations where the camera battery might run out & need two to get thru day 
26629 3 Slides on with a friction fit. Fits nicely. Very light weight. Glossy finish so will reflect light into lens, so I will use some steel wool to roughen up the surface. 
26630 4 My son has a lot of Camera s .I didn t think I could fine a bag big enough buy WOW this is the Bag.He thought it was great and so did all his friends 
26631 4 somehow, my husband managed to misplace his battery charger for the camera I bought him. I got the idea to order a replacement from my best friend, and I m so glad I followed through. Now camera works after a year of a missing charger! 
26632 4 Very nice and powerfull lens 
26633 4 Works great! 
26634 3 Good. Sturdy. Great Quality C Stand 
26635 4 Definitely helpful as you start to stack up the photos. More pages than I would ve imagined, as it can hold quite the amount of film! Arrived in good condition, good quality, a great buy if you re to use the Instax camera. 
26636 3 more than what i expected for the price 
26637 4 It is perfect, inexpensive and does exactly what it says it will do. Arrived on time 
26638 4 Great product. Great service A++++ 
26639 1 Product was returned. Camera itself seemed to work well but app is not friendly with older foscam cameras and old / most recent foscam app does not work with this camera when you have other old cameras as well.. Foscam needs a single app to control all cameras 
26640 4 The lens caps arrive quickly and fit my camera perfectly. The strap will keep me from losing the lens cap. The bundle is great because I have two lenses and two caps for backup. 
26641 3 The clip fits my phone, but the only that that stinks is taking the cover off the phone so it can fit in the clip. Other then that it is a good buy. 
26642 0 Too expensive! Same quality as generic but you pay 4x more for this one. Lose yours? Buy a 4 pack genetic for a dollar less than this single cap. 
26643 4 I purchased this for our upcoming trip. This is a great device for night time pictures when you want to minimize camera movement. Works well with my Nikon D3100. 
26644 0 I ordered 2 sets and only one unit out of the 4 would make connection with any of my flashes. The other 3 units would not react the pins on my flashes to trigger them. I tried all my SB-900 s, SB-700 s and 1 SB-26. 
26645 4 Great product my boyfriend loves it ! 
26646 1 First of all the lens advertised was a Samyang lens but what actually ships was a Rokinon lens.They both had a F6.3 rating though.Go figure. I couldn t get the T-mount to attach and fully lock unto my Sony a-37 camera. A partial attachment just won t cut it. 
26647 4 Fast & sharp, less color and image aberration on borders. It is definitely an upgrade of its predecesor. I recommend it ! 
26648 2 nice but you realy need an optical viewfinder 
26649 3 There are several cut outs in the foam, but none of them are very clear of their intention. However, the case is great otherwise. 
26650 4 I use this to protect my laptop screen for the oils on the keys 
26651 4 Fast shipping, good product. My old Canon A50 is purring once again in all its digital glory! 
26652 4 this case came earlier than i expected! it s adorable and exactly what i wanted! thank you so much!! 
26653 4 Excellent. 
26654 4 Great product delivered as advertised. 
26655 4 I m very proud of these items. 
26656 4 The best deal ever! Outstanding start up camera and accessories for a new DSLR person! 
26657 2 Pretty good, it sticks well. But the Aperture wheel and Shutter Speed wheel are not even as close as the original ones on the camera. So leaves a three star. 
26658 0 Would not work with remote. 
26659 0 It would not hold my Samsung Zoom. So I m not using it at all....gave it away. 
26660 0 makes the picture not sharp 
26661 4 Excellent lens for the money 
26662 4 Need it to keep my Dremel Tool charged. 
26663 4 Good style and very easy to use. with my EOS 5D and 24-105 Len. 
26664 4 I love it ! It is a great and useful product. 
26665 1 Great to use but stopped working after a year with light use 
26666 0 does not fit on the Go Pro 4 
26667 4 Works as it should. STRONG clip spring. Can t go wrong if you have a need for this kind of rig. 
26668 0 They display screen was broke 
26669 0 This product does not work properly, the software is out of date, and something I didn t know is that COBY went out of business in 2013, so there isn t a website or a customer service # to help troubleshoot the issues. DO not buy this product! 
26670 4 Built well and no slippage when locked! 
26671 4 This works great. The remote doesn t have to be pointed right at the plug in to turn the light on and off. It makes turning the light on and off super easy. 
26672 2 I wanted to like this so bad, but the fact that you have to watch a light blink to figure out what is going on is a major con for me. Too confusing. 
26673 4 Inexpensive, works great! Highly recommend if you need to replace your oem charger or if you just need an extra charger! 
26674 4 Was a gift to my mom. She really likes the camera and all the accessories that came with it. 
26675 4 Good quality. Comes with a case that holds all the parts--some others don t. 
26676 0 Hi!! I received my selfie stick with a problem. Thank u for pay attention to my coment. Sincerely Julio Mejia. 
26677 4 Great product

26679 0 These are not original DJI. They caused my Phantom 2 Vision to fly anyway it wanted. It wouldn t respond to the controller at all. Put the original blades on and it flew normally. These blades cause me to crash my Phantom several times. 
26680 4 Nice little set for a great price. We mainly bought it for the float, which worked nicely while snorkeling, but we also put the selfie stick on it during a dive to get video of some harder to get places. 
26681 3 The ítem did come on handheld for me. It replaced my ítem guay no longer worked. 
26682 4 Great product. Good price. Fast delivery! 
26683 4 As advertised. Adjustable so it can accommodate larger hands. Very good quality. 
26684 4 So happy with my purchase!! The camera came earlier than expected, which is always awesome!! we ve had a blast using it this far, can t wait to take it in the cruise!! 
26685 3 Excellent 
26686 4 This tripod is great. I needed something to support a small portable projector and other mini tripods would not do it. They just collapsed. This holds it up without any flimsiness and the positionable legs are great. Highly recommend this tripod. 
26687 3 Arrived timely, precision cut and fit. It is a great product for new Go Pro users. Was unable to road test it, due to cancellation of trip due to weather, but it will be road tested. If it fails the test, you will be hearing from me. 
26688 4 Excellent camera, with all the features I wanted and more. 
26689 0 BAD QUALITY. Very flimsy plastic. I expected better. No instructions and I can t tell what goes with what! 
26690 0 System instructions are very poor. You are unable to setup the wireless cameras if you do not have a windows PC so MAC users do not buy this system. Returned to Amazon for a refund 
26691 1 I could not get it to link up to my smart phone. I tried everything I could. 
26692 3 Simple camera great forntakin pic of any and everything I wouldn t use it for photo shoots but serves its purpose takes great pics of my kids when they are silly and crazy lol 
26693 4 Great product. Easy installation and durable. Have had for my property for over 2 years and no problems. 
26694 0 I sent it back. It would not maintain a network connection well enough to be usable. Tried it with apple, Windows phone and android. Definitely a bust. 
26695 0 battery has very poor performance. it only functions a very short time before the battery is dead. I would like to return these two items. 
26696 4 Got it really quick. works perfect 
26697 4 Really nice and simple to use 
26698 4 Works great 
26699 4 NOT ONLY WAS THIS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT, IT WAS ALSO THE LEAST EXPENSIVE OF ALL RETAILERS THAT I CHECKED. 
26700 4 Fits my JCV record 
26701 2 Had to send camera back to manufacturer within a few months. It came apart. They did send me a new one. It was just a hassle to have something brand new that fell apart. 
26702 4 helps keep stands from tipping over and easy to see 
26703 2 It s good for the price but the things look a bit cheap the selfie sometimes twists with my iphone 6 plus to heavy for it. One of the lenses is two pieces in one and it came apart. But over all for the price its ok. 
26704 4 Does the job. 
26705 4 works as promised. 
26706 4 This is my third Canon digital SLR. Amazing cameras for the price! Very forgiving. Be sure to check out all the special features and program the camera to your liking. 
26707 4 Fits great 
26708 3 not bad 
26709 4 works great, now we know when someone enters our yard 
26710 4 Works great for such an oldie I love the way the picture turn out and the assisted focus is really cool, and it s hipster, how many other people have an al-1 everybody has the aw-1 
26711 2 Much slower than I thought it would be. I miss the rapid shoot feature on my previous camera. Not a good camera for taking quick succession shots. 
26712 4 Im loved no more strees. Protects the flash falla and better movility 
26713 1 outside very hot is dropcam feel hot is broke i call nest support shipper new dropcam only inside 
26714 3 Works great, just as advertised. 
26715 4 Great price for all you get. 
26716 4 Fantastic sling and fantastic value for its quality. 
26717 1 No marker to know where to attach to lens and won t sit in the case like before. Plastic is very thin and cheap. 
26718 1 Under powered. Returned unit, then struggled with vendor to get refund. It did appear to be well built. 
26719 4 luckily I could get, I saved my machine lens 
26720 4 These are awesome cameras for the price. Very clear picture day and night. WAY better than my older Sony cameras. Very Pleased! 
26721 0 Doesn t work. Charged, but it wouldn t turn on, and then not charge after. Cheap junk. 
26722 4 Vincent was great, I love my camera, great product 
26723 0 doesnt fix, 
26724 4 It s great 
26725 4 Excellent quality. secure and comfortable around the neck line. 
26726 4 Great little camera 
26727 3 Very fast delivery. Satisfied with the quality, its just that the size is 1cm wider for a Samsung NX2000 screen. 
26728 4 awesome better stable shots 
26729 4 Nice clean low light primary lens. Auto Focus works properly with motor in camera. It is another great lens from Nikkor 
26730 4 Good Batteries - provide 2h 21m for Sony Handicam HDR CX220 
26731 4 Great package! 
26732 4 GREAT replacement for the original GoPro batteries which cost a crap ton more. These even hold a longer charge it seems. 
26733 4 Great for nature, light, water resistant. Comes with case and lense covers. 
26734 2 It s okay, quality is good but it is kind of hard to use with my camera. It makes it hard to reach the shutter. 
26735 4 I feel like it s priced a bit high but it does work very well and is probably exactly what you re looking for if you ended up here. It s solid and works much better than trying to hold your hand or something over the screen. 
26736 4 Good battery 
26737 0 Came without monitor I have to spend 200 more to get all stay away! 
26738 2 Nice pattern and fabric but can be difficult to fold down. 
26739 4 Best home wi-fi camera on the market. Simple to set up. 
26740 4 Love it!!!- 
26741 4 they are awesome 
26742 4 This is the real DJI parts, not fake like some others advertised! 
26743 3 Simple enough to put together. Don t like the little ring that can be seen on camera at night. Without that it would be 5 stars. 
26744 4 Very good quality 
26745 4 I can t say enough about this little drone. Flies so well!! So simple to fly I bought them for my 8 and 10 year old kids. They love them!! Almost indestructible. If your thinking about getting one... GET IT! You wont regret it! 
26746 4 As a newbie to Go Pro, there is more than enough in this kit to keep me occupied. I went through everything and tried out several. Fit and finish is great. The only thing that I would like to see is a compartmentalized case large enough to hold everything. 
26747 4 Exactly as described. Shipped immediately. 
26748 4 Lots of tech for not that much money. Loads of fun especially if you are looking for a different perspective on photography. 
26749 4 Product was fine. five star 
26750 2 Mount was hard to slip onto the mount. 
26751 4 Arrived early! And the paper works as advertised! 
26752 4 So far this is awesome. 10 minute setup Very good broadcast for a wireless camera. Going to get some more and see how they tie together. 
26753 4 Works great and floats decent enough 
26754 4 well made. The pop-out foam is not a perfect fit but not a big issue.mu 
26755 4 Great chest strap. you forget you are wearing the chest strap. This is the much better than wearing it on your head. 
26756 4 Great variety of mounts for temporary FILMING situations. Set it and forget it. 
26757 3 Another cheap alternative to GO PRO big dollar mounts works well I use it in vehicle don t know if i would mount it on the outside of car 
26758 2 satisfied 
26759 4 Good fit, finish and function. 
26760 4 The cameras are high quality with great resolution. I added this system to my garage to supplement the system I already installed on my home. The software is easy to use and I am pleased with the initial quality and use. 
26761 4 The products are working fine. Good quality. 
26762 4 Works like a charm !!! The Little dot in the center of the receiver turns on a BRIGHT BLUE when the unit is on which makes this even nicer than we thought. 
26763 3 Very nice Camera, I have had mine for 3 years and it still shoots very well. Animal shots can be very hard to get and its very lightweight and I can carry it in my pocket wherever I go. 
26764 4 pretty straight forward, they do what they re supposed to. these are nice. would buy again 
26765 4 Great binoculars. I didn t realize how much better they could be until I spent the money on some quality optics. I wished I had bought them sooner. Really awesome in low light. 
26766 4 Very nice small digital microscope. To maintain a clear image, the microscope must be held steady...even the slightest movement will affect the image and deliver erroneous measurements. If you intent to use this for measuring, definitely get the precision stand 
26767 1 They re buoyant and colorful but way too big for a woman s wrist- It can be worn on the upper arm 
26768 4 I have been using it for about a week now. The quality of the product is great. Very versatile as it can be adjusted in size (fits in my backpack). 
26769 4 Grate 
26770 4 This camera is amazing, I have a d610 that I really like, but the d750 has made it the backup camera 
26771 4 Excellent 
26772 4 Using it for my Fuji X1S. Cost one third of original battery but performs equally well. 
26773 4 Fits well, cheap 
26774 4 300 photos and still on a single charge. 
26775 4 Good lens 
26776 4 Great film. I develop it in TMax developer. I like Fuji Acros, too. The two seem pretty similar to my eye but I usually use Fuji. Gotta help keep Kodak going, too, though. 
26777 2 Batteries dont last very long like the name brand ones but overall worth the money for a back up 
26778 2 Okay, but not worth the money though. 
26779 4 Awesome 
26780 4 Arrived on time and as described. 
26781 2 This does the job, but occasionally hard to pan back to different angles and lags. 
26782 4 Excellent grip 
26783 4 Great product. 
26784 4 just as advertized 
26785 2 The camera is nice, setup was easy. The deal breaker for me was all the videos I tried downloading to my phone were so fragmented and choppy that they were unusable. Otherwise the live viewing was fine and the settings were easy to navigate. 
26786 2 wouldn t need so many if collar had an ON/OFF Switch thankfully I bought them 
26787 4 product does what it is suppose to, links my phone to my computer via usb. the choice of delivery personal ment it went to my next door neihbor though since obviously the delivery man(woman) cant read those big huge numbers that shows my address up on my house. 
26788 4 Excellent 
26789 4 I highly recommend this case. The EOS came ina red color such as the inside of the case... but is very helpfull if you want to carry your camera with an extra battery and maybe some extra memory. 
26790 1 Not very happy with the product. The quality of the products are little cheap. The tripod is very light and usable though. 
26791 4 Works flawlessly.. AMAZING night time video (night driver).. 
26792 4 Excellent camera! 
26793 2 Inexpensive monopod is great for alternative to paying top-dollar for an authentic pro monopod. 
26794 4 Works well, came charged. Like that they have a Canadian store 
26795 4 Original GoPro died after a year. The Wasabi s, after a year and a half are still going strong. 
26796 4 Good value for price 
26797 3 Picture quality as expected. Great price compared to retail store pricing. 
26798 4 Works awesome. Batteries last similar time to the gopro ones. Nice to have extra batteries and a dual charger. Haven t used the car charger yet, but I m assuming it works fine. 
26799 4 Extremely nice unit, stable, flexible, nicely packaged, folds well into small, light size with handy carrying case. 
26800 4 The product is great my son loves it. I would also like to thank Winston for his wonderful customer service. 
26801 4 I love this camera I have it behine the window its clear also not ir at nite indoor be awsome 
26802 4 I love this camera. And the setup help that I received from D-Link was excellent! The tech, Jasmine (AR00426) was so nice, patient and helpful. I would definitely recommend this camera and D-Links support service. This is case #C6719277 
26803 4 Nice product. 
26804 4 I ve used it a couple of times and its worked perfectly. Thanks! 
26805 4 Item arrived in about 3 days and it was as advertised and worked perfectly. Would buy from dealer again. 
26806 4 Handy solution if ou always lose lens caps 
26807 3 This pack is well made and nicely cushioned. It fits a T3i Rebel just right. The velcro &#34;shelf&#34; at the bottom is adjustable so you can use the pack when you have the kit lens on the camera or a longer one. 
26808 4 Just got the batteries and charger in the mail last week. It s working great so far 
26809 3 Takes awhile to set up on the software end of things, but the functionality is great once you re able to get everything up and running. 
26810 4 was the exact as the store bought. it fit everything I needed, and I still had room 
26811 4 Excellent kit, great seller, great customer service, great warranty offered!!! A mandatory kit for anyone with a Nikon DSLR!!! 
26812 4 It worked. 
26813 4 Works as well as OEM and much cheaper. 
26814 4 Batteries work great and is way easier than charging one battery at a time 
26815 2 Works reasonably well. It is lightweight and a bit flimsy. Not particularly compact or easy to travel with but it s a pretty solid choice for a tripod. Anyways, it s cheaper than other brands so I recommend this. 
26816 4 Received as new 
26817 4 Such a precious gift for our 6-year-old! She loves is and has had tons of fun making Instax photos in a flash! 
26818 4 Arrived on time, and as expected Placed in camera immediately! 
26819 4 Excelent product. 
26820 4 Great tough little bag! 
26821 4 The product came as advertised and functions just as advertised! It s a great product for the price! 
26822 4 Great seller ,product as picture 
26823 3 Great camera bag, sturdy, padded, lots of pockets, just wish it was a little bigger. 
26824 4 Probably the best purchase I have ever made. Love everything about it. Easy to use. Easy to transfer onto a computer. Great quality. 
26825 4 I prefer a wrist strap because it is less bulky and I dislike having a camera swinging around my neck. 
26826 4 Fast shipping, batteries charge extremely quick!! 
26827 4 Great Quality Product. Does everything that I want from a Circular Polarizer. Breakthough Photography is emerging as a big player in the photography filter market. I am Pleased! 
26828 0 Too bad 
26829 3 Battery meets with all my expectations and does the job. 
26830 4 Love it I have been able to use this to take professional pictures for products I sell on Amazon and on my website. It had to ison it out to remove the lines. 
26831 2 Takes a little bit time to set it up with SmartThings. Also the refreshing interval is too long and you cannot adjust it. 
26832 4 Great batteries long long battery life 
26833 4 I recommend this to everyone. This camera has night vision and motion detection. I use in my childs room and my business. You should order this. 
26834 3 Great binoculars for the price 
26835 4 Great underwater camera with good images with existing light. However, flash photos are not as good as standard point and shoot. 
26836 0 Camera is gray camera not warranted by Nikon. Products within kit are all low quality. Vendor poorly packaged product and it arrived damaged. 
26837 4 Great 
26838 1 there was no button on the bottom to click to take a picture and it is not 21&#34;, it is much shorter. 
26839 4 you will not get a better lense for 99 US-dollars. 
26840 0 If you have less knowledge about setting up such a cam then choose another product. The whole interface and simplicity of setting up this camera is far beyond dlink standard. Don t buy it. 
26841 4 Worked perfectly with my Nikon Coolpix. 
26842 4 Great 
26843 4 Ideal 
26844 3 This little camera bag has come in so handy!! I am able to fit some light snacks and some loose bills for our theme park adventures. Also, the inside is padded and I know our little camcorder is supported and safe. 
26845 4 Love it! Works great. 
26846 4 Great camera, very durable 
26847 4 Seems like just what I was looking for. Faster shutter speed and high quality pictures. 
26848 4 Extremely comfortable and versatile strap. I use it everyday and experience no pain in my shoulders whatsoever. I recommend this to anybody who carries their DSLR with them all day 
26849 4 Worth every penny and more. Operates at the same level and higher cspacity than $50 OEM battery units. No issues with my Canon EOS Rebel XT. 
26850 4 6 months passed but it still works well 
26851 3 I love these little things as hotshoe covers. 
26852 4 Is cool 
26853 0 Motion detection not accurate. It sends u a snapshot after the person is out of frame and still sends u notifications when that camera is not supposed to. The night vision is not good unless you are really close. 
26854 4 An excellent binocular at moderate price. 
26855 4 Phantom and accessories fit perfectly, and it s right size for carryon baggage. Went on a hike in the pouring rain with this on my back, didn t get to fly with the weather, but all kept dry. 
26856 0 Beware!!!! Do Not Purchase!!!! The Controller Does Not Pair With The Drone!!!! Total Waist Of money!! 
26857 4 Works well for an after market charger and the car charger was an added bonus. 
26858 4 great camera 
26859 4 Now, I never have to worry about having a dead battery. 
26860 4 More than i expected 
26861 2 It meets my needs. 
26862 4 I attached it to my camera. I went into the water. My camera floated. End of story. 
26863 1 Bad quality, for the price its bad. 
26864 4 Love it 
26865 3 For the price, it s a good quality filter, cheapest among the brand names purporting multi-coated surface. Build quality is good and screws on the lens smoothly. Does not degrade image on a consumer DLSR and lens and effectively protects the front element. 
26866 4 excelent 
26867 4 I got this for my son and it was perfect. It as exactly what he wanted 
26868 4 Works great. Perfect for traveling. 
26869 1 the handles came off the moment I put it on the camera. 
26870 1 Charges but came broken so I have to tie the battery in to make it stay. 
26871 4 SD cards fit great, Very good buy 
26872 3 Works as good as a new one. 
26873 4 Low price. Works great. 
26874 4 received item very quickly.....its works great!!!! 
26875 4 I think that it is such a great product for such a great price!! it s working great without any problems. 
26876 2 It s easy to use and transport. I d just prefer that it was a bit more powerful as I continue to have shadows in certain places while filming. 
26877 4 put this in a derby car over the weekend and it took a lot of hard hits and for it being plastic, I am amazed at how well it held. 
26878 3 This camera took a few attempts to get it hooked up to our wifi and phones correctly, but once we did it has been great! It seamlessly switches from regular to IR and the speaker and microphone work great. 
26879 4 Great experience with this order. Camera is as advertised and shipped quickly. I m already looking into accessories. Would use merchant with confidence. 
26880 4 Great quality...strong wifi signal! 
26881 4 This is the best 4k camera for the buck. Loving my new machine 
26882 3 The lens cap bundle arrived in a timely manner. The caps do the job required by our staff. 
26883 0 I received a wrong item 
26884 2 It s works as expected only issue is it discharges very fast when I use rechargeable batteries. Works best with disposable. Bought new rechargeable thinking the old ones couldn t cut it but same issue with the new. 
26885 0 Good only for about a year. When you warranty is up that s it. NO fixing or replacement. Really bad deal 3 out of 4 gone bad and the 4th doesn t work well 
26886 4 Very good ... 
26887 4 Just as good as the $100 version. Autofocus in most cases is not needed because the focal range is so small....although this product provides for autofocus in both types of Canon lens I have yet to use auto focus. 
26888 4 This is a great little air blaster. It gets all the bits of dust off my lens and camera, and it s small enough to squeeze into my camera bag. I specifically didn t want the larger models because they looked huge, so this one fits the bill just right. 
26889 4 Great space for camera and side pockets for batteries and USB cable. 
26890 4 DJI can do no wrong with me they make good product all around. 
26891 4 it was good 
26892 4 Works really well. Only thing is - You have to remember to turn on the microphone. I forget sometimes. That s on me, not on them. 
26893 4 Great quality and lots of extras but the case is a little flimsy 
26894 4 Very good product for the price!! Do the job!!!! 
26895 4 Gotta have it because the original battery power doesn t last as long as this. 
26896 4 Perfect for me who has 2 gopro hero 4s and a lot of accessories.. not everything fits but this helps a lot 
26897 4 cute! 
26898 4 I bought this for my Nikon D5200. It fits the 18-55mm lens perfectly, but will not fit anything larger. The little zipper in the lid is great for an extra memory card or my wireless remote. 
26899 4 Love it work real good and clear 
26900 4 I got this as a birthday present on August 27th, 2015 and I love it so much. I had the wide instax and wasn t sure if this would be too small a size photo but it s perfect. 
26901 4 Excellent binoculars which I used for my African Safari. 
26902 3 I live in the mountains and have a large front porch which is where I installed this. It s located high enough to where nobody can touch it without using a ladder. 
26903 4 grate i wish i can fine more seniors though lol. 
26904 3 Works well👍🏼 
26905 4 excelent 
26906 3 Not quite as solid feeling as my Canon 600 ex-rt. but it gets the job done. Would have gotten five stars except for the feel. Also less than half the cost of the Canon flash. 
26907 2 a toy 
26908 2 while shooting an event, some of my shoots came out warm colors and others very cold. Hope I can figure out this issue by next event, other than that, great item, easy to use, lots of functions, great price, fast delivery. 
26909 3 Excellent for the money. Use it for video work. 
26910 3 Works well, just as advertised. 
26911 4 Love this lens. It s great to have the wide angle option for my Canon digital SLR. And the price is right! 
26912 4 Absolutely great 
26913 4 Fits the LX100 great, opens up when the camera is powered on, highly recommended if you don t want to fiddle with the lens cap. 
26914 4 Great product, works great, thank you! 
26915 4 Holds all of my camera goods with space for more, I fit my camera and three lenses all in it, also cleaning supplies and straps fit well! 
26916 4 Fits my Go Pro Silver 
26917 4 Good 
26918 4 Excellent! 
26919 1 plastic and cheap feel, digital viewfinder was fuzzy and slow to catch up when moved. 
26920 4 Excellent 
26921 0 So tiny! 
26922 4 Excellent case keeps the gopro in place. Highly recommended, Purchase with confidence. 
26923 3 Very nice product 
26924 4 These power packs worked just fine. No problems. 
26925 4 go to the tube and see how to works.... first install the usb to ur pc.charged it? then follow how it works. just got it..meeennnn im going to bust this bastard dr s that take advantage of my spinal cord injury..the video is perfect.even the picture works great.tku 
26926 4 Awesome 
26927 3 Extremely well made. Comfortable to carry. The quick release straps rather stiff to start. Expensive but you can see and feel the quality. The chocolate color straps look more orange than brown in reality. 
26928 4 Easy to use, sturdy, comes with a storage bag. Well made tripod. 
26929 2 This will give you plenty of light for portraiture or any setting where you are not firing it over and over again. For serious event work. No. It will leave you hanging. The hvlf43m runs circles around this flash for event work. 
26930 4 nice 
26931 2 Picture Quality is horrible, Mic only works for the person holding the camera, the ones you are recording literally have to shout to hear you and there is no light other than that its ok... 
26932 4 good product, very fast service. 
26933 0 Stopped working after one use, and the sound was terrible 
26934 4 Very nice case. Much more utility than I expected. It also appears to be well made. I know I ll get years of service from this case. 
26935 4 This bundle is great. Everything works perfectly. And you sure Can t beat the price. Definitely recommend 
26936 4 Works the way they said it would Came when they said it would. 
26937 2 Very *very* slight fuchsia hue, but the real problem comes on cold mornings. On two occasions these frosted completely and were totally unusable since it was like shooting through opaque glass instead of clear. Put it away on humid and cold occasions, figure something else out instead. 
26938 4 Works perfect for my application. And it is relatively light which is a requirement. 
26939 4 Great product. Works perfectly on my Sony A6000. I highly recommend it. 
26940 2 Too many unusable pixels , too much noise beyond 400. 
26941 3 They work well was expecting some bigger cameras tho. And the night vision is good! 
26942 4 Worked perfectly 
26943 4 Fabulous pics..... 
26944 0 not match with D40.cheap made bad quality.not recommend 
26945 3 The glasses were wonderful but the strap was not good at all. The weight of the binoculars made the strap cut into your neck. 
26946 0 I ordered two of these photo frames and upon receipt one wouldn t even power on and the other frame s color on the screen was very distorted. 
26947 0 Very poor quality photo and video. Set it to he 1080p setting and tried everything to get the best picture; never happened. Not sure why in the world there are anything over a one star review on this. Returning asap to Amazon. Don t waste your money on this. 
26948 2 Noisey play in the follow knob, pics up on mics. It s a good cheap follow focus to get practice on in spare time 
26949 4 These are quality lights that I wish I had purchased a long time ago. Although a carrying case isn t included, the small boxes can easily fit into a duffel bag for easy travel. 
26950 4 excellent quality and helps when moving stands 
26951 4 Perfect lens for birth photography! 
26952 4 Wish I could find more. They seem not to exist! 
26953 3 This works. It does not work with Polar Pro filters attached though. 
26954 4 great 
26955 4 Love that it has the double cameras for a broader view. We want purchase two more for all our vehicles. 
26956 4 Great 
26957 3 Much appreciated, if sold at more reasonable price. 
26958 4 Excellent lens. It is a bit heavy, but to me that s what a quality lens should feel like. 
26959 4 This is exactly what it says it is, a lens cap for Canon EOS EF 18-55. I had accidentally lost mine, and this was the perfect replacement. 
26960 1 Meh, the video on your phone is better unless you live in 1980. Move on. 
26961 4 Got this on a ridiculous deal to use on our Honeymoon in Belize. No water ever got into the camera. All you had to make sure was that it was sealed and that the gasket was covering it well. 
26962 4 Great for the type of camera that I own. 
26963 0 This viewer does not work, and unfortunately, I will return it. Rounded cornered slides work fine, but squared cornered slides get stuck and do not eject from the viewer. 
26964 3 I don t use it for anything but landscapes as the focus softens anything with sharp detail is not up to standards. 
26965 4 Saving much money since I no longer need to constantly purchase lithium batteries for my dog s invisible fence collar. One of the best decisions I have made lately, and I will be looking into buying similar chargers for other battery sizes! 
26966 4 Great little camera 
26967 4 Great camera for the money for sure! I say you should buy it! 
26968 4 These lens cases are great! Good quality with a soft lining for extra protection. Definitely recommend!! 
26969 2 The quality is not the best 
26970 4 Just what I needed 
26971 4 Descent case , good price. No complain 
26972 4 Worked well and easy to control. Setup just takes a little bit of effort. 
26973 4 My daughter loved it, exactly what she needed for photo class. TY 
26974 4 Super bright and amazing. Great price. Very happy. 
26975 3 excellent quality, but the backdrops are wrinkled, so I brought them to get pressed, which costed me an extra $30.00 for all 3. 
26976 4 Excellent Product 
26977 2 Couldn t get it to work with my internet, never got it to show up in my computer or phone 
26978 3 love it 
26979 3 Decent quality case at a modest price. Bought for Canon G16, loose fit for the camera. 
26980 4 This worked perfectly for my camera. 
26981 4 Perfect quality!! 
26982 4 Great buy. Would defenely recommend it. 
26983 4 Good replacement 
26984 3 Very happy with this lens. Used it on a full moon shoot and was pleased with the results. For the price, can t go wrong. 
26985 4 I love this filter. Used it for sunset and beach shots this summer and the effects were stunning. Highly recommended. 
26986 4 Everything came as ordered and works fine. 
26987 4 DSTE is the best non OEM grip out there period! I ve tried 3 others and this grip is by far better. The build is spot on with the OEM and all buttons/knobs work just like the OEM. The seller shipped fast from China and it arrived 8 days early. 
26988 3 Good Product Works as expected 
26989 4 Does what it s supposed to do. Solid build. 
26990 3 Worked exactly as written. 
26991 4 good for the price 
26992 3 Decent for the size. Has some trouble with light correction but worked fine with my fatshark goggles and a hawkeye transmitter for 5.8 ghz fpv. 
26993 4 Great value! 
26994 4 Great product 
26995 4 This is tripod is cool, a good deal, and does exactly what it is supposed to do. I am specifically using it for my compact Nikon, CoolPix camera, and it holds perfectly. 
26996 3 for peace of mind a low cost worth every penny.. 
26997 4 Great Tripod 
26998 4 They do jut what you expect batteries to do, charge and discharge. 
26999 4 Work good I am so happy I could used my camcorder again I fix it my self. 
27000 4 Great products, would recommend for everyone 
27001 4 Great color and very sharp photos! Last of the great 35 mm film for my great film cameras. 
27002 1 @ 6 months - Defective Monitor ! shuts down! occasionally needs to be Reset? 
27003 4 Works as well if not better than originals for a fraction of the price! 
27004 3 Useful product! Liked it. 
27005 0 This is not compatible with a p900. I called Nikon to confirm. DO NOT PURCHASE 
27006 4 great clear pictures and easy to use beats my I-Phone for pictures 
27007 4 wow what a package and all of them are useful. but yes i havent used all of them yet. But i really liked everything and all are of good standard. Exceeded my expectation really. 
27008 4 Fantastic. Incredible picture. Incredible price. Great bundle - all good stuff. These people are fantastic. Excellent customer service, fast shipping. Great in all respects. 
27009 0 It s defective....but I did not know that at that time so I could not return and I wasted money... 
27010 4 AAAAAA+++++ 
27011 4 Great camera. 
27012 4 Love this camera, easy to use, love the look of the camera and the case! I would recommend to all! The mini photos were a hit at the party in the photo booth! Just wish I would have purchased the mini photo album book to put the pictures in! 
27013 4 Real solid one 
27014 0 The wifi is not working i tested this cam with ios and android 
27015 2 Didn t work with my camera so I cannot review it. Make sure your camera can do wireless 
27016 4 I got this for my daughter fro her 10th birthday and she LOVED it! Great gift! 
27017 2 I had to send it back because it was way too big and bulky for my needs. The leather was a really poor quality and the front straps that snap were cumbersome. 
27018 1 More pink than red not to happy 
27019 3 I m fairly happy with this purchase. The only complaint I have is the length of the quick connect straps is too long and looks ridiculous hanging off the camera so I never remove the strap. 
27020 4 The product is great. Lightweight, portable and easy to use. There was a delay in the shipping for some unknown reason but Amazon gave me a $20 refund for the inconvenience. 
27021 4 works 
27022 4 It s great for getting tubes on video 
27023 4 No problems with product and/or delivery. Works as described. 
27024 4 great 
27025 0 This camera isn t really that good. The Mydlink site has a time limit on continuous viewing. There are several more things, but why pile it on? 
27026 2 This arrived safely and as scheduled. It fits okay but acceptable with some adjusting; but not a perfect fit. 
27027 4 it works just fine, no problems at all :) 
27028 3 It is awesome! It is way bigger than it appears, I highly recommend this product, it s perfect for a camera and some small stuff. 
27029 4 Great Value, works great 
27030 4 Solid stand, no issues. 
27031 4 Good product 
27032 3 Love nest cam, except for 15% of the time when it says &#34;offline&#34;. I also have a thermostat which rarely goes offline, so I know its not my internet connection. Also, why is the subscription cost so high? I would get it, if it wasnt a ripoff. 
27033 3 Plug in didn t work well. had to adjust in all the time in the socket, still. good batteries, good price. 
27034 4 Haven t used every item as of late, but what I have used works as intended. 
27035 4 Perfect fit. No issues , great service and delivery right on time. 
27036 0 Cheap plastic 
27037 4 works great, good value, fast shipper. 
27038 3 I bought this little guy for my gopro. Its definitely not &#34;heavy duty&#34; as the product description states but gets the job done. Great little tripod for the price. 
27039 4 I recommend, fast delivery. very good 
27040 3 Great Price and easy to use.. 
27041 4 My daughter loves the product. Customer Service and product expectations where met. Love it. 
27042 4 I have dozens of rechargeable batteries that I use for photography. This is great because it holds them reasonably snug and with the two partitions, I can keep the charged and depleted batteries separate. There aren t many cases like this, so this was great. 
27043 4 Came two days early. Great surprise!! Excellent condition. Looks and feels brand new. Great buy!! 
27044 3 Not the exact copy of the Nikon part however the form fit and function is right-on. Excellent Service from the vendor. Ordered two additional sets of caps just in case one is lost or comes off again. 
27045 3 Great price for the cleaning set. The Purosol solution really cleaned up my lens after snapping pics at a teppanyaki restaurant. It would be nice to have an extra pack of Altura lens paper. 
27046 2 I like the camera but when using the fisheye lens underwater, water gets between the fisheye and normal camera lens. 
27047 4 Fits - timely delivery 
27048 4 Works great, the wifi remote with this adds to the value. 
27049 4 I was pleased with fast shipping and Lens is perfectly and I love it.:) Thank you 
27050 4 Fits well, easy to put on and take off. 
27051 4 I like that i can charge 2 batteries at the same time. Great buy 
27052 1 I ordered the black backdrop but received the white. It did come in one day though. 
27053 1 It is not quite comparable to Vera Hub 
27054 4 excelent extra life for your camera 
27055 1 For the amount of money this cost me the quality should have been a lot better. And now I can t get rid of the thing for even half that amount. 
27056 4 Great product 
27057 3 It s nice and big, but almost too heavy to hold itself up. The rod on the umbrella bends a bit. I m worried it may break eventually or bend too much. But for now, it works and gives me a nice big reflective surface at a good price. 
27058 4 Order came in fast and was well packaged. Easy to assemble and get operational. Home security even on the road. Which we tested while away on a long weekend. 
27059 3 Good 
27060 4 Cowboy studio has the best equipment for the price 
27061 4 Fit perfect! Serves its UV purposes but also peace of mind in protecting my lens face. 
27062 1 Fills up with water and then does not float 
27063 4 Sprays just enough air to make it work for small spaces. Perfect and no need to use nasty chemicals. 
27064 4 great! 
27065 4 I have more pieces of equipment than I know what to do with. But, I will figure it out. I look forward to more professional photos for my website. 
27066 4 The Oly Pro lens are great. 
27067 4 They arrived on time and they were great 
27068 4 Manual focus, manual aperture, and no image stabilization. I m using it on a APS-C SLR in AE mode. Creamy texture for landscapes and a wonderful lens for group pictures. I will be using this on my (all manual) film camera also - the advantage of older lenses being non-gelded. 
27069 4 Good replacement battery for my camera. 
27070 3 It was everything I hoped for 
27071 3 Great one! Should buy 
27072 4 Awesome for the price. 
27073 4 good 
27074 4 Quick, fast, simple, easy 
27075 1 lots of vignette 
27076 3 Nice album for instant prints. 
27077 1 Expensive for how long it lasted. picture quality/ auto-zoom mechanism deteriorated quite quickly (my family can be a little hard on electronics, but no so hard that it s unreasonable). Vast majority of pictures don t zoom quite right. Better with an iphone at this point. 
27078 0 It s too lightweight so it tips over with a heavy smartphone. 
27079 4 working as intended 
27080 0 This product doesn t let you face your camera forward which makes it useless to me if the only thing it s capturing is a side view. 
27081 3 Works as advertised. Compact and good workmanship. 
27082 4 It is light and protect the Phantom 3 and all parts. Really nice product. 
27083 4 Very quick shipment. Quality item. 
27084 4 Great experience. Very fast shipping. Thanks. 
27085 1 I bought 3 of this, 2 had to returned, its either the plug in adapter not working, or not working properly! and only the first one works within 4-6 feet! 
27086 4 got this camera when it first came out; love it. I have taken thousands of pictures with it; never had a problem with it. will keep this camera till it dies. 
27087 4 Great suction mount! A great buy with a low price. GoPro s version is like 4 times as much and just as good 
27088 4 The product is excellent and easy to use, it charges all my batteries without problem and since I read that some of the customers had problems with putting in or taking off the battery but I ve haven t experience that. Mine runs smooth for the Canon T3 bats 
27089 4 Great batteries and charger. I use them for my Nikon d90, and have never had a problem! 
27090 4 Great price. 
27091 4 Delivered as expected...works great!! 
27092 2 Works as advertised 
27093 4 The flash work beautiful with my camera. Have it professional output. 
27094 4 Great Cam! Easy to set up & use. 
27095 4 Perfect 
27096 1 Um.. Great case, but it s a square rectangular shape that looks a little boxy... also the purple comes out 5 times darker.. ok though 
27097 4 Can t beat the price. 
27098 4 Still got to test it more. It charged fully and seem to be running well. 
27099 3 The Teleconverter worked fine in my Canon. I did not realized that it would not automatically focus if the lens being used has a 5.6 apert.; but otherwise, focusing manualy is fine. 
27100 4 Calvin the tech was great. VERY KNOWLEDGABLE AND COURTEOUS He knew where to go and did things the other techs did not do! 
27101 4 all good thanks .. 
27102 4 These binoculars are very lightweight and easy to carry around. The visual clarity is much better than the older cheaper and much heavier ones we have. I am impressed with the view and focus. These are well worth the price 
27103 4 Bought this for my grand daughter to go along with her pink camera. Looked ALL over on line and in stores for a camera case with some design on it in pink. Very hard to find...well, this is perfect. She LOVED it. The colors pop and looks great. 
27104 4 works flawlessly 
27105 3 Super awesome and sturdy. 
27106 4 Perfect replacement for original charger. Additional batteries an extra plus. Packaging was excellent. 
27107 3 Simple, but works great for what i needed. 
27108 4 Good value, all parts seemed well made and fit well on my Go-Pro. More than I will ever use. 
27109 4 Works on the FZ-1000. Bright light that allows you to dim/brighten as needed. Excellent product so far. 
27110 3 Great item 
27111 4 Very good ball head IMO, especially the price. 
27112 4 Plug and Play with enough information to fly your Multicopter with TV Display or Goggles. 
27113 4 Great lens shoot very well! 
27114 0 Died after being used for 5 photos. 
27115 4 I love this unit it works great 
27116 4 Brand new and arrived quickly. 
27117 4 Great for taking vibration free photographs and time exposures. Although the release can t take timed photos, it is able to be locked open for long exposures with manual timing. 
27118 4 Great! 
27119 0 Moves way too fast for practically any video usage. If someone can show us how to slow it down I would probably give it a better rating, but as it is, it is pretty useless. 
27120 3 Good for the price. They lag a little bit connecting and they blow threw non rechargeable batteries. But easy to set up and use. 
27121 0 The display worked well but the remote controller did not work. 
27122 4 Very well made protection for my Manfrotto tripod.I use it all the time. 
27123 4 It was a perfect fit for my camera. 
27124 4 good so far. 
27125 3 Great upgrade for my old Q-see system! 
27126 4 Works as advertised and alot easier to install than the reglar cloth straps that comes standard with the cameras 
27127 4 One of the best out there. 
27128 4 Good job 
27129 4 nice pics cheap 
27130 4 Glad we purchased. A great addition to our gear. 
27131 4 Thank you thank you thank you thank you. Canon lenses + Sony body = happiness 
27132 4 fits perfect on the screen of my camera! 
27133 3 it is fun! 
27134 4 Great price. Works well. 
27135 4 Fast Shipping. Bought for our Daughter and she LOVES it. 
27136 4 Performed brilliantly. Got some nice pictures in the pool. Will be taking it snorkel I got next. 
27137 3 Good 
27138 4 Very fast shipping and very happy with it. 
27139 2 There okay, use them here and there.... 
27140 4 Effortless set-up and pack-up of all of these type screens. Saves a Lot of time for chromakey, etc. Recommended. They used to come in a really nice zippered heavy-duty blue case with handles, which itself could be put to use as a small Blue screen. 
27141 4 Great! 
27142 1 Poor quality, selfie connections did not work,returned you get what you pay for !! 
27143 2 2 out of 3 of mine don t lock to the lens properly. When you get the good one it stays that way. 
27144 4 As good as the real thing! 
27145 4 Great filters! They work really well, I love the look they give. The case to hold the filters is great quality as well. Would definitely buy these again in different lens sizes. 
27146 0 It did not fit my lens 
27147 4 Great 
27148 4 So far so good within a few days of attaching it to my Sony RX100 IV. Fits well, and changes the handle of the camera - in a better way. It adds a secure feel in handling the camera. Definitely a must have. 
27149 4 Cool 
27150 4 Bought this for my trip to Oahu, Hawaii. Real life saver. Not a drop got it. Floats in the water. Super convenient to store phones and wallets. Will probably buy one or two more as gifts! Great purchase, happy customer. 
27151 3 Exactly what we needed. 
27152 4 Still going strong since 2007 after hundreds of cycles. 
27153 1 The legs are extremely thin and unstable. 
27154 4 I cannot love this thing enough. For the price this thing is amazing. Can pull up live feed anywhere you have internet or a cell data signal. My friends always ask where I got it and how much it was. They can never believe how cheap they are. 
27155 4 The quality of the camera is outstanding. Never worry about it anymore. 
27156 1 I pulled it brand new from the amazon box, and the zipper sticks horribly! I kept it because I needed it for a trip, but very unhappy about it. 
27157 4 Great price 
27158 4 I love it!! thank you so so much! it works just perfectly 
27159 4 As advertised 
27160 3 Very easy to install and operate. I like it!! I also liked the price. It s a much better system than the one I ve had for years and couldn t operate. 
27161 4 Great protection! 
27162 4 Great item 
27163 4 Gift for my wife. Great product, prompt delivery. 
27164 4 Works good 
27165 4 Good one 
27166 2 FITS MY GIRL S COMPACT CAMERA PERFECTLY 
27167 0 It is great, but, am waiting for the camera to use this kit 
27168 3 Work as expected 
27169 4 Good picture, just as good as the expensive name brand cables. Well worth the price 
27170 0 Stopped working after couple months 
27171 4 Exactly what I needed 
27172 4 I have been a D.P. for 21 years....this far exceeded my expectations...if you don t need a large head to carry a big camera....this is amazing...not only just for the money...but I have heads worth 5X as much...this one really works well....paired with their carbon fiber legs....great 
27173 4 Great camera bag. 
27174 2 Charged as expected. Took a couple of hours. But the battery didn t last that long in Camera and battery life didn t show up on screen. 
27175 4 Excelente! 
27176 4 good camera 
27177 4 I liked the product, and had no trouble with the purchase. thank YoU! 
27178 4 Great quality for what I paid. I use it more than I thought I would. 
27179 4 works great photos in green shallow waters and glass lens is both a great protector for lens and scratch resistant. 
27180 3 Works and functions as expected. The downside is that the software is compatible with old operating systems like Windows 7. 
27181 4 Great product, good price! 
27182 4 This is just perfect!!! Nicely package and looks great. I will post a picture soon of what my cakes look with it and without it to show the major differences. I use it for cakes but it will also work well with jewelry or pretty much anything 
27183 4 They work pretty well and compare to the original batteries, so far no problems. 
27184 4 Meets my expectations fully 
27185 4 nice filters 
27186 0 item does not fit requested refund. Have not received approval. 
27187 2 dropped a 8mm fisheye that did not catch the holster. Needs padding inside the belt where the metal housings are. Lots of bruising. In the future I think I will combine one side with the Spider and one side with the Black Rapid strap. 
27188 3 Good ring light, bright LED s, good xenon flash as well, but as others have noted, it s difficult to get the light to stay on any given lens. 
27189 4 Can t get enough of this thing! I love the 4k quality and recently used it in a neighborhood cleanup effort in Detroit. The time-lapse feature is probably my favorite. It is very impressive. 
27190 4 As described 
27191 4 Great battery, great value! 
27192 3 Nice bag and fits a good ammount of gear. Only problem is it s a bit tight to zip and can get stuck 
27193 4 Great lens at a great price. I bought it used, but whoever owned it took great care and it s basically like new for a fraction of the price. Thank you! 
27194 4 Works phenomenally. Haven t had any issues with it fitting inside my camera. Would recommend 
27195 4 A must have for portrait photography! Clean Sharp images with beautiful bokeh. 
27196 4 works even better than the original that came with the camera 
27197 4 Loved having all of these back up camera batteries. 
27198 2 They sent me the wrong color, instead of white it s red... didn t know that there would be no sound when zooming in or out. Other than that everything works okay. 
27199 4 I am very pleased with it. Best thing I ve bought in a long while. 
27200 3 No significant drop-off from Canon batteries. Great to have replacements at inexpensive prices. 
27201 4 [[VIDEOID:9c439f3b04874cf69db357b20ad3fe9d]] My videos are typically short and sweet, but this product demanded a more lengthy video. I hope you enjoy it. I received this unit gratis in exchange for an honest review. 
27202 4 Great backpack for Camera equipment 
27203 4 Works fantastic , very good for the money , I am very happy 
27204 4 Thanks! 
27205 4 Good price. 
27206 4 Comes with everything I need 
27207 4 One word,amazing! ! 
27208 4 Awesome 
27209 0 remote won t work on canon t5i as advertised. Tripod is okay, you pay for what you get. not the best but decent for the price. 
27210 4 Batteries currently last about 5 hours per charge, far beyond my old camera. Only time will tell how they will hold up, but so far they are great. 
27211 4 A great lens!! 
27212 4 Works as expected 
27213 0 Battery did not fit in my camera. Had to throw away the product. 
27214 4 Great item. I ve used it for a while and had great video taken from this thing! 
27215 4 Very easy setup. Very useful in lighting up dark areas. I installed it next to my back door in garage. No more trying to find the keyhole. Very bright!! Motion sensor perfect 
27216 4 love these batteries and charger...I ve got several... 
27217 4 Beautiful pictures with this lens 
27218 4 This rig is dope! Don t set it up like dude had it in his video. Camera should be behind the handles. Also buy one of these to offset the shoulder pad. Way better if you plan on using a view finder. Sick rig for sure! 
27219 4 well packed and everything needed to use with the sony camera 
27220 4 awesome product great price would buy again 
27221 4 [[VIDEOID:e4369a1019f77856e8979118bb9ab375]] 
27222 4 Great product, it fit on any bag, no matter if it is a messenger or backpack.... I fit a Sony A6000 with 3 lenses.... recommended. 
27223 3 It was delivered quickly, it fit exactly what I wanted and for a finale they included a great (gratis) microfiber cloth. They even followed up with an e-mail requesting feedback. 
27224 0 didn t work for me 
27225 0 Lens cap does not fit once the lens hood is installed on 16-50mm kit lens for Sony A6000. Hotshoe cover does not fit either for my Sony A6000 ILCE. 
27226 3 Works good with my new Panasonic DMC-ZS50K camera. Pocket is good enough for a couple of extra batteries, and design is good. Seems to be built well. Zips easy. 
27227 3 A nice case to keep additional items such as an extra battery and/or memory card with your camera. The interior is soft and won t scratch your camera. My only problem is the Velcro and nylon strap material can/will snag most 100% polyester shirts. 
27228 4 Great camera in all respects 
27229 0 Not 900 tvl as advertised or atleast I got shipped 2 800 tvl cameras ? 
27230 4 I have not yet used the car charger but the home wall charger does what it needs to do and I am totally satisfied. Price was right, it charges the Nikon CoolPix camera I picked up on the cheap. Now I just need a proper USB cable. 
27231 4 Amazing. Lots of fun with this little camera. 
27232 4 battery works great 
27233 4 ok 
27234 4 I needed a spare for traveling. It works perfectly for my needs. 
27235 3 Nice kit and nicer price! Everything fits perfctly with my gopro. Delivered on time. Use the gopro screw insted of the one provided, it get oxid after first use. 
27236 4 Honestly don t know why anybody would get another tripod. Best bang for you buck. Granted it isn t as smooth in motion as the top of the line. But for those that need a ball head tripod this is the best. Solid construction and will last a long time! 
27237 2 Nice, you can see edges of the lens hood. 
27238 1 pain in the ass to use 
27239 1 This has a European style plug and you ll have to spend at least $5 more for an adapter in order to use it. 
27240 4 Good 
27241 4 This scope comes with a tripod and an eye attachment. Very good accessories and scope for the price. I have used this scope to look at stars and the moon, very pleased! 
27242 4 It good 
27243 4 The rave reviews of these binoculars are all right on the money. These are fantastic optics for the price. 
27244 4 Great charger, never had a problem with it. The travel and D cell kit comes in handy. Will be buying the higher end model next time and use this for travel. 
27245 2 works as expected 
27246 4 Using them for my twitch stream, they do exactly what I need them too. Seem sturdy enough for my use. Would not recommend using them outside. 
27247 4 Thank you very much. The shipping was really fast. I love the camera. It is the perfect camera for pictures and vlogging. 
27248 4 Pre-cut compartments that fits the GoPro PERFECTLY! Handy case to store all the go pro products while protecting it! Boyfriend loves it! 
27249 4 😊 
27250 3 It has a very clear picture during the day and the night feature is very cool. Never knew so many animals are running around at night. 
27251 1 Was really expediant on shipping , but this is not a minolta lens its an olympus OM. Should have done his research before posting .... but hey for $15 the oem hard shell case Is worth it sux I cant use the lens though. 
27252 0 I purchased this item,it did not work properly. I sent for a refund, i ended up losing 126. in restocking fee all because their equipment did not function correctly, very unhappy. I will never buy from this again..... I give zero star rating 
27253 4 Look professional. 
27254 4 Great quality at a great price …works perfect …good suction on the suction cup!! 
27255 4 My daugher loves this case for her point and shoot camera, especially the extra memory card slot. 
27256 3 works well. charges well. 
27257 4 No issues, works as intended. 
27258 2 ok 
27259 4 Great camera! Great price! Good response for my questions! Very happy with delivery! 
27260 4 Very clean, used body. have been pleased with the camera and fast shipping. 
27261 4 Best camera gadget I have ever purchased! 
27262 0 I tried one of these with a 76 MZ-5 and Canon 1dx. It did not work in TTL or ETTL at all. Pretty much just fired full blast all of the time. Could not find a fix so I returned it. 
27263 3 Could fit the P3 a little better. However, plenty of storage, very nice in general. Good build quality. Suits my needs. 
27264 3 This case is small & perfect to put in my carry on. It s sturdy construction should protect the camera well. If I have anything to add I ll return after my vacation and update my comment. 
27265 4 Such a conversation starter even if I m just wearing it. 
27266 4 be Careful, this unit is super strong. I threw it in my console and forgot about a laptop hard drive I had in there..... let s just say it s clean. Cheap way to wipe your HD! Seriously though, this magnet is ridiculously strong, an it doesn t scratch paint. 
27267 1 Getting this device to take video is complicated and the instructions are poor. I got the clock set, but have tried twice to get it to take videos. Have not yet succeeded. 
27268 4 ohh yea have already done some cool time lapse with this baby, and just waiting to experiment with leaving the shutter open for certain periods of time. 
27269 4 Great product 
27270 3 Works well to take pictures of rooms! 
27271 3 For beginner I think I chose the right camera for me more than enough stuff to learn how to use over the next 6 months to a year 
27272 1 Didn t fit my camera even though I was led to believe it would. 
27273 4 Cheap, but only of the price. 
27274 0 i need np-fp50 please 
27275 3 its like canon 580 ex II...takes bit longer to charge...and it is not recognized by the canon CAMERA...so ettl works partially...example...increase power dont work from camera 
27276 3 Canon PowerShot SX700 HS Digital Camera 
27277 4 Wonderful! Amazing for the price. Shipping was slow by Amazon standards but I couldn t be happier with the product. 
27278 1 Does not stay on well, wish there was a camera store near me. 
27279 0 Another lemon I brought! It doesn t work with Canon 70D! 
27280 4 Better than the original charger. 
27281 4 GR8 Seller, loved my items and received them in record time, can t wait to take some pictures! A+++++ 
27282 4 Love my flash. I love how it automatically works great with burst shots. 
27283 4 This is the best deal ever for a non-professional photographer such as myself. 
27284 4 So much cheaper than buying the GoPro brand accessories! We basically saved hundreds of dollars and they are good quality products. 
27285 4 Works great! 
27286 4 You can t go wrong with this one PLUS it came with a car charger and a wall charger with are awesome! Thanks for the extras! Have yet to have to use both batteries on the same shoot with my GoPro. 
27287 4 delivered promptly, item was as described. charged the two batteries and am ready for a day with my camera. will shop with vendor again. 
27288 4 I should have gotten this sooner, if you want to get more versatility out of your camera this is completely worth it. Its great for capturing wide landscapes and taking pictures half above water half underwater. 
27289 0 I just got them and noticed that they drain really fast. (I have the go pro hero 4 silver.) My gut said get the go pro brand but i got cheap. You get what you pay for 
27290 4 Product as described. Would do business with again in the future. 
27291 0 Strap is well made but the small strap that go under my armpit is loosen all the time, can t lock it, the plastic buckle is the problem. 
27292 3 works just as described. only for indoors. not weatherproof but I covered mines with plastic for outside gate. remote works fine from 40ft. 
27293 0 RETURNED....this is NOT for a Nikon D3100 as it indicates 
27294 4 It is just a simple box...but GREAT in wet conditions !! 
27295 4 Great, love it 
27296 4 This battery has more capacity and lasts longer in my Sony Camera than the original. The price was great, and it arrived very quickly. This is a very good choice for replacement of this camera s battery! Thanks, jon 
27297 3 Good job 
27298 4 The padding is nice and thick and the case is light weight. Fits my camera perfectly. 
27299 4 I have two of these, but his is the one I use. I had a little trouble figuring out how much water to put in to make it neutrally bouyant but it works terrific otherwise! Would highly recommend this! 
27300 4 all ok 
27301 4 Very nice 
27302 4 It fits my Olympus Tough-1 camera perfectly. 
27303 2 It came fold so it has wrinkles and I roll it to see if it goes away I m waiting to see. Color it nice but I can t use it since it has wrinkles 
27304 4 Luv my new selfie stick this works much better than other s I ve used. The built in blue tooth switch and rechargeable battery make is very easy and fun to use The Rotating clamp and extended arm make for great angle shot s 
27305 3 Great product.. 
27306 4 Very pleased with this product. 
27307 4 Works great haven t got it wet yet I ll mount it on my racing jet ski this weekend so far really good deal 
27308 4 Great product! 
27309 4 It is the same as the original battery and charged and worked just like the original battery. 
27310 4 Just what I needed. 
27311 4 Works great. Really easy to setup! 
27312 4 fun copter to fly easy and stable but the FPV is really bad, see the RC forums for more about this. I recommend DO NOT buy this for FPV you will be disappointed. But for a fun quad to fly this is fun!!! 
27313 4 Great product! I will be purchasing again. 
27314 1 Loved what I received but the measurements were off from the description. Did not fit my Olympus. 
27315 4 This is a superb camera. Does so much for its size. Excellent for low light use! have always loved Canons but had to break away on this one... 
27316 4 great 
27317 2 there is no instruction or any package infomation in the package. 
27318 4 does what it says its gonna do --sometimes the tightening screw comes undone but it has never fallen out 
27319 4 I m very happy with the batteries!! They arrived quickly and they work great! 
27320 2 The case for my phone recesses the phone s lens and the lens clip doesn t compensate for it. This makes for a cumbersome removal of the case and I usually don t bother. 
27321 4 Super Fast Lens, buy it. 
27322 3 thank you for every thing. It is excellent. 
27323 4 Fast service, great price and happy customer. 
27324 4 Product was as advertised. 
27325 3 It s has only one fail , when not tight all the way it wobbles ... 
27326 3 decent enough digital camera. You just need to get a rechargeable battery 
27327 4 Arrived on time and works perfectly. 
27328 0 I ve received just 1 component. Add is not correct.... or the store trick us .... Do not buy it. 
27329 2 Fits all equipment but not very comfortable. 
27330 4 excellent product. 
27331 4 Good sale 
27332 1 I received this camera Monday. Extremely excited about taking pictures. I bought film for it as well, opened the camera put the film in and it didn t work. I watched several youtube video and read instructions and still isn t working? What s going on here ? 
27333 3 Quality was okay. But acceptable for the cost. 
27334 4 Excellent product and service 
27335 3 as described, got it fast 
27336 4 Works fine and cheap. 
27337 3 My daughter loves the camera. She took it to camp this summer. The picture quality is similar to the old polaroid pictures. The film is a little pricey, but fun. 
27338 4 Good 
27339 4 Love this and the convenience!!! Thanks! 
27340 2 not compatible with our Xfinity system. Returning 
27341 4 I am totally pleased with the 2 batteries. They arrived quickly and were a very good price. 
27342 4 Works great, we love it. 
27343 0 it was fine. just what I expected. 
27344 0 I ordered this case in the yellow with white dots. It came in the mail-it s the brown one!!! 
27345 4 Nice product arrived on time 
27346 4 Great service and product. Loved the ease of installation and helps greatly to see my camera screen in bright sunlight. Very inexpensive protection and photo taking assistance! 
27347 0 Very bad quality. In a two days one motor died. Bought new and replace. In a week another one died. 
27348 4 Great product. Exactly what I needed at half the price. 
27349 3 Good fit and decent build.. 
27350 0 No directions... Lists my camera, can t figure it out 
27351 4 The filters are amazing quality for such a low price! Bought them for my wife and she loves them! Fast shipping as well 
27352 0 Didn t fit the battery that suppsably it fit, didn t find out till the day I needed, 6 months later 
27353 4 Works really good with my Nikon D5500. I completely recommend this item. 
27354 4 Very hipster and ideal for a photo bug. 
27355 4 Was very helpful 
27356 0 Awful. Something appears to be wrong with the film. All pictures are either under or over exposed or don t turn out at all. Have tried two packs. Prior to this, the camera was working fine. 
27357 3 could be 2 inches bigger all the way a round than it would be perfect 
27358 4 My father asked for this as a birthday gift. He absolutely loves it and made a point to buy the extra battery and parts to keep it running. 
27359 0 Instructions are vague at best I have not gotten it to work at all as of yet 
27360 4 As described. No issues. Fits well onto the diving housing for a hero 4. 
27361 4 These batteries and charger was just what I was looking for. 
27362 4 Works with the Sony HX300 well! 
27363 4 Exactly what I expected. 
27364 4 Excellent product....fit every need of mine and came when scheduled. :) 
27365 3 The piece fits my D7100 perfectly but the magnification is virtually unnoticeable compared to the stock eyepiece. 
27366 4 Worth every penny! 
27367 4 Great as I expected! 
27368 4 It s a bright portable light. I would advise getting the li-ion battery & keep a spare set of AAs for backup. It looks weak around the shoe mount so be careful handling it. It s not Nikon or canon! 
27369 4 love it and easy to use 
27370 4 excelllent 
27371 4 Exactly what I expected. 
27372 2 I didn t believe the non-auto-focus would be an issue, but its a huge issue for me. I m keeping it for rare use but won t use it as much as I had hoped. 
27373 4 excellent tripod. I am using it with my pochade box. It is stable and works well. I love how small it folds to and fits in my backpack. 
27374 4 My 13 loves it takes it everywhere! Works great underwater! 
27375 4 Great product! Love it! 
27376 4 Just as expected, thank you 
27377 4 A great blogging/vlogging camera for beginners. 
27378 4 Very good, quality item.Love it. 
27379 0 not that great 
27380 4 Excellent!!! Full of room for all your gear!!! 
27381 3 cool... wish more came with the package 
27382 0 I bought this selfie crap it broke at the base where my hand hold the grip this is not a well made product don t buy it not worth it! 
27383 4 Shipped quickly, as described 
27384 4 My very first DSLR Camera...easy & fun to use & I can take better shots now. 
27385 4 Great price works better than expected 
27386 2 These cameras perform ok for what you pay. I know there are better options for color, clarity and resolution. This cameras does its job ok for such a low price tag. 
27387 4 They worked pretty good. 
27388 3 I would give this battery 3.5 if it was available. My Sony battery being very old still charges up to 235 min. This battery gets up to 190 min and discharges to 10 min of charge in about 80 min. But as a spare battery it could work. 
27389 3 Better than extensions not as short of a space to get your subject in focus. 
27390 4 Works! 
27391 2 Noticed some color fringing in the corner of some images. 
27392 4 I;ve been using this for about a year now. It was easy to set up, great picture and nice to see outside where there are no windows. Just added two more cameras. 
27393 4 Very nice present for my son. 
27394 4 holds all my camera and lens 
27395 4 Great case. This will easily protect our camera 
27396 4 very good for the price 
27397 4 Gift for my husband - he was very happy with this gift! 
27398 2 Telephoto did not work with my camera. Seller was prompt to make adjustment. Not happy with the product, but happy with the service. 
27399 4 Worked great, very happy we did not need to by a new tripod! 
27400 4 Can t use my camera without this... 
27401 0 I don t understand how this product has such good ratings. Almost every joint in the box did not fit with my gopro hero 4 housing (see the attached photo). There were a few exceptions, but I wanted a bundle, not a few working items. 
27402 4 Son in law was happy 
27403 0 Broke in 2 days. Not worth using 
27404 4 Perfect for camping flash light. 
27405 3 This came in a different color, but it s cute anyways. 
27406 4 Nice. 
27407 4 Great price and worked great for my nikon d40 plus lens, battery charger cables and more! 
27408 4 Very happy...very inexpensive replacement for the Nikon. 
27409 4 Very nicly made holds alot. Canvas looks good and it is a nicr quality bag 
27410 4 great! replaced the one I broke that I loved. 
27411 1 Added nothing special lighting wise 
27412 4 I have yet to get a bad Think Tank product despite many orders and many years. It does what it promises and does it well. 
27413 4 Love this little camera 
27414 4 Great stuff and on time 
27415 4 Great pole, easy to extend, gives me comfort we won t lose our GoPro while jetski-ing. Have purchased another, as a gift. 
27416 0 This product is identical to two others that I bought for about $4 each on Amazon. On all three the ball joints loosened up after 2 or 3 uses and it can t be used after that. Don t bother. 
27417 4 This strap worked exactly as advertised, and it works great because it allows freedom of movement rather than having the camera sit at chest level. The clasp is very secure and well done. Very happy with it 
27418 4 Good 
27419 3 Looks and feels like high quality leather.......probably because it IS high quality leather. Fits the Sony RX100M III perfectly. Leather, adjustable shoulder strap. Would like to see a small pouch on the back side for a small lens clothe. 
27420 4 Perfect! 
27421 4 Great Product!! 
27422 4 Great Product and Excellent Quality. 
27423 3 I like it,it does its job with ease. 
27424 0 misleading 
27425 4 It works and matche dmy len. Pinch caps are the best. 
27426 4 fits perfect with my camera 
27427 4 sturdy and comfortable:) Love the cute designs and the attractive color ^^ 
27428 4 This is a extremely useful dolly and I love using it when shooting shallow depth of field. 
27429 4 perfect 
27430 4 It is exactly as described. I would deal with this supplier again 
27431 4 As advertised and fast delivery. 
27432 4 Customer support is fabulous. Worked on my issue and continued until problem was fixed. 
27433 1 Not near as cushy or comfortable as I had hoped. Looks nice but just doesn t have enough padding. 
27434 4 Very beautiful bag 
27435 4 a gift 
27436 3 Delivery was fast and it works great. Some of the accessories were not worth having but the package is still a good value for the beginner. 
27437 4 Fits my nikon d5200 perfectly. Cute and sturdy. 
27438 4 Love it! 
27439 3 Good product so far, 
27440 4 Super replacement. Highly recommend!! 
27441 1 Pretty flimsy when extended. Can t support the weight of the go pro and will spin around. 
27442 4 nice set 
27443 4 I recommend anyone beginner or expert to own one. Can t go wrong for the price. Overall a great camera. 
27444 4 Works great! Still on my first protector 18 months later! 
27445 0 The CD with the software is full of viruses, detected in different PC running Symantec and McAffee, could not yet find the software to download from the realand.com website. So far useless. 
27446 4 Great Lens for travel and walking around. The focal range means you can shoot up close or wide without changing lenses. The pictures I get are tack sharp. Great lens at a great price. 
27447 4 use all the time-it works perfect so I always have backup when I m out on the road taking shots 
27448 4 great! 
27449 3 Great little lens for beginners to try macro photography. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of shots. Give it a try. 
27450 4 It s pretty sweet! I used it last week when I went diving and its great especially with the variety of lengths you can choose from! I like that it had a padded bag and parts to connect my camera too! 
27451 2 First one died after 10-15 pictures. Amazon was great and sent a new one and I returned the old. New refurb unit has worked very well for what it is, a point and shoot camera. I like the wifi capability and it works well with my IPhone 6plus. 
27452 3 It converts nicely, but I wish the screen was a little bit larger, so I could see what I needed to adjust. 
27453 2 Bulky 
27454 4 Good 
27455 4 Henry was very helpful to fix my modem issues. Camera works great Thank you 
27456 3 It works perfectly! Your only problem will be to change the battery as it is hard to pop open the port. Other than that an excellent product. 
27457 4 Works great. 
27458 4 great for my a6000 
27459 4 I purchased this camera as a gift for my son. His remark about the camera was &#34;awesome!&#34; The camera takes great photos and the zoom is amazing! May purchase one for myself! 
27460 4 Excellent Camera and an excellent package and price 
27461 4 Got the job done! 
27462 4 Very positvive this battery. In perfect status. 
27463 4 Great product for the price. the Lense cap was bit tight for my Nikon camera but it works fine. Will certainly buy from this seller again. 
27464 3 Looks good. Sent back bc i don t have internet 
27465 4 Henry Campbell is the best. So helpful! 
27466 0 Zipper jammed, and I destroyed the zipper trying to fixed that..... 
27467 0 It s listed to fit the Fujifilm X-T1 but doesn t. 
27468 4 great seller - delivered as promised! 
27469 4 I just wanted some easy to use quickly lens, and these are perfect.They are good if you are on holiday and want to take some nice shots or if you have some pictures planned. Especially good with the iPhone 5s as it has the very good camera quality! 
27470 4 Works perfectly. Safe, secure and attractive. The elastic function around the lens acts much better than the typical through-the-eyelet keepers 
27471 4 Thank you! 
27472 4 Perfect for what we need them for. 
27473 4 Arrived on time. Fits the charger and the camera as promised. Arrived with a greater charge than the battery provided with the camera. 
27474 2 Batteries are a bit larger. Tight fit 
27475 4 Excellent package 
27476 4 NONE 
27477 3 Love these things. I wish they were cheaper because I need 3 more. 
27478 4 GREAT PRICE,FAST SHIPPING, I BOUGHT THREE OF THEM. 
27479 4 Excelente 
27480 0 Pretty tinny cloths 
27481 0 I had to return these cameras due to the terrible connection to our wifi. The image quality was nowhere near 720p. I ended up purchasing a hardwired security camera set that works better. Save your money on this product 
27482 4 thx 
27483 4 was my husbands birthday present for his gopro. he loves it we carry it everywhere. 
27484 4 Excellent product. I use this for my spotting scope at the range. This allows for easy fine adjustment at extreme distances. Very intuitive. 
27485 2 Good for what I payed for it. 
27486 4 The battery was only $7 including shipping. Has quite a bit more milliamp capacity than the original. Made a great replacement battery. 
27487 4 GOOD DEAL 
27488 0 Complete garbage 
27489 4 great. 
27490 0 I purchased this shutter release for my Nikon D3300. the button on this release has a tendency of getting stuck and if you have your camera set to bulb mode this may lead to over exposure. I d recommend looking for something of better quality 
27491 4 Awesome camera for family! Super intelligent mode, a lot of scenarios and effect for more professional look. And also fully manual mode for more professional job. 
27492 0 most disappointing,worked for one day, total lack of support,phone calls were endless loop,emails returned.sending it back will be another irritation. 
27493 4 great product thank you 
27494 4 These are made pretty well, very happy. 
27495 4 works great easy to use 
27496 3 A LITTLE HEAVY, BUT IN THE TOOL BOX. 
27497 4 We bought these for a trip to Aruba...I was concerned about the quality of picture it would take but was pleasantly surprised that the underwater pictures turned out great!! Also, they were available at the gift shops on the beach for $22.00 EACH!! 
27498 3 The stick extensor is a little flimsy not for any major X-sports ,just casual pics all else as expected 
27499 3 Cheap, comes dirty, scratched up, but what can you expect for a cheap Copy Stand. Definitely got the job done though. 4 star because it came beat up. 
27500 4 This cute tripod does just what it should. The iPhone is held firmly in placen no wobbles. And I love the remote shudder control. I would purchase from this company again. 
27501 3 Super prompt with delivery. .great items for on the road photo shoots. 
27502 4 Works just like it is supposed to. Not sure why the other one died but...... 
27503 3 very nice 
27504 4 So adorable, looks like a purse but holds the cutest camera ever. 
27505 3 Great idea however it does not close completely. It saves time and hassle of removing the &#34;standard issue&#34; lens cap. 
27506 4 Great buy I love all the features it has, especially transferring photos straight to your iPhone. 
27507 4 Its a perfect size for my camera. Not too big, but holds everything. Love it! 
27508 3 A bit difficult to lighn up with the camera lens but other than that works great! 
27509 4 Love it, best mount I have bought so far. Easy to use and not in the way. It is as if you were riding the bike while watching the video. 
27510 4 take some getting used to but overall but works great. 
27511 4 This works well. 
27512 0 terrible sevice will not refund item keep saying nrver got item 2nd return both item don t work keep away kenneth 
27513 4 It was exactly what we need and it came with a string that connects the lens to the camera to prevent loss of the cap in the future. 
27514 4 Fast shipping !!! Had Everything my Boyfriend wanted. Great price 
27515 3 Works as expected. Nothing fantastic but allows for a lot more use than the tiny battery. 
27516 4 I am extremely pleased with my Sony DSC-RX100M III Cyber-shot Digital Camera and its accessories. 
27517 4 love it 
27518 4 Great! Wow I love it. 
27519 4 These radio triggers are simple, rugged and reliable. I use them for weddings, location and studio work. I especially love that I don t have to deal with cords anymore! 
27520 0 I does not work properly and need to return Garbage 
27521 3 Very pretty colors inside the film. We liked the transition from one pictures Frame to the next 
27522 4 Very good 
27523 4 This camera was a birthday gift for my husband, who takes pictures of things like Venus and birds a quarter of a mile away and continues to be amazed at the picture quality and features. Best gift ever according to him! 
27524 4 good 
27525 4 Quick service. Everything arrived as expected! 
27526 4 Great service and great product!! I could not be happier and am having lots of fun playing with my new toy. Thanks so much 
27527 0 It s so hard to press the button on the stick don t buy this buy a selfie stick with seperate camera button to take the picture. 
27528 3 works wonderful as a white black and gray refinance i would recommend this to any photographer from hobbyist to professional 
27529 0 Only one worked. The other never worked at all. Shortly after I received the package (2 weeks) the second battery stop working. Not worth the buy even for a short period of time. 
27530 4 Great System , easy to set up. 
27531 3 Works, big and bulky 
27532 4 good 
27533 4 Performed as expected. I like the way it folds to a compact size. Seems to be made well and for the price, it is a great product!! 
27534 4 Thanks! 
27535 1 Didn t stick well to my kayak at all. 
27536 0 it suks and thay all broke after 2 days 
27537 3 good size! 
27538 3 Came as ordered. Looks slightly different than the one I was replacing, but works the same, and fits the same! 
27539 4 So pretty~ suitable with nikkon coolpix p900.. And color is amazing...... 
27540 4 Simply perfect. Works great, Provides protection and does it s job well. 
27541 0 Too big, too wrinkly, doesn t come with stand. 
27542 4 I needed the extra length cable to go under the eaves of the house from the furthest point. Had a little left over at the DVR but no problem. The camera worked perfectly. 
27543 3 Great little camera 
27544 4 Item was as described and arrived on time 
27545 2 Buen producto 
27546 3 The screw is a little long. Did not fit my application. Quality is better than expected. Have to return however. 
27547 4 small, efficient, and the hot shoe can be unscrewed so it can be mounted on a threaded screw. 
27548 4 Perfect fit.. 
27549 4 Great set of lenses, inexpensive, and they definitely do the trick without spending a fortune. 
27550 4 My friend recommended this camera to me. She said she likes this model over the newer model. I don t know the difference, but I sure love this model. It s user friendly and works great, indoors and out. 
27551 3 will see if I need it 
27552 4 Go seemless or go home. I switched from canvas this and wow. Editing is a breeze now, and if there is a mess tear off the sheet and pull more down. 
27553 0 Useless if you d like to shoot anything at a down angle. Works ok straight on, but if you attach it to something and point it down at an angle, the top just starts drooping down. It can t hold the position. So, kinda pointless.... 
27554 4 The batteries are working great. 
27555 4 works great 
27556 0 Does not work looks very odd way 2 big took forever to come. 
27557 4 I needed the battery charger and it was a much better price than what was at a local store. I was pleasantly surprised to receive so much more than just the charger. 
27558 4 Great camera! 
27559 4 It was a great addition to my go pro! very easy to use! 
27560 4 Plastic fantastic. 
27561 4 Nice to have a bunch of these lying around. In the desk, in the backpack, in the car, with my sunglasses. Keep our screens and glasses clean without scratching! 
27562 4 Good 
27563 3 Easy to use. Did a good job of converting 35mm slides to digital. 
27564 0 The camera filled up with water 5 minutes into the snorkel trip. 
27565 2 My tapes get stuck in the door while trying to remove them. Have to jiggle them vigorously, then they can be removed. 
27566 4 Works perefext. 
27567 4 Thank you, it was exactly what I needed. 
27568 4 aaaaa 
27569 4 This camera is great! It s sooo cool and cute. And really easy to operate. The directions and manual answer almost ever question you could have. I LOVE it!! 
27570 4 nice product 
27571 4 Brilliant!!! Great customer support...completely intuitive to use. 
27572 4 simple to use with great outcomes 
27573 4 very good 
27574 0 Product is not compatible with Polaroid Zip Printer. I only get &#34;Paper Mismatch&#34; error. 
27575 0 I flew great then about the 5th flight it broke. Took it to hobby show they said it came with a burnt out motor. 
27576 4 Very nice set for the price. I am new to digital photography, and these filters are very helpful. They arrived in good condition, well-packaged, and I am pleased with the purchase. 
27577 4 Great item! 
27578 4 Amazing lens!! Very good quality and it s affordable! 
27579 4 incredible camera. 
27580 4 Love the bag but would like a little more room 
27581 2 It works, but there is no real way to get it tight because of the elastic. It bounces mad moves a lot if you have it set on the top mount making the video almost unusable. 
27582 4 This is an excellent clip. It stayed on my backpack shoulder strap was easy to adjust and went all over Europe shooting video constantly. 
27583 4 Got this a deal of the day for a great price. Its one of the best sling bags I have used. 
27584 3 Very durable product. Withstands a great deal of intensity using the product. 
27585 2 I want to love these, they are good, but if anything knocks them over, the umbrella boning bends so easy! My other issue is if you can t attach a reciever and use the umbrellas. I had to buy a new attachment that allows me to use it. 
27586 4 Great little-power house of a camera. Looking to add other glass on the camera. 
27587 4 Works great, love it! 
27588 3 Good resolution 
27589 4 All good. Thanks! 
27590 1 Only after using it once, the battery door broke. 
27591 4 Love it 
27592 4 Excellent! 
27593 4 great compact bag you will appreciate during travel 
27594 4 When used with various Lowepro bags and their utility belt, this is a great way to distribute weight and reduce the strain on my shoulders (already an issue with two Nikon DSLRs). 
27595 0 The Internal Foam is not useful. Size doesn t fit the GoPro well. 
27596 3 The item was delivered earlier than expected. The quality of the product isn t the greatest but works as expected. 
27597 4 I was very satisfied to see that this replacement was exactly the same as the one I lost. 
27598 4 it came with everything promised and it works great 
27599 0 The filters have internal mounting treads and are for a Polaroid. They will not work. My Minolta AF200M Zoom 28 - 100 needs filters with external treads, 55mm for may D7 Maxxum; which is what I ordered for. I will never us Amazon again for my photographic needs... 
27600 4 This item was exactly what I needed and came right on time. It arrived the day before my trip, which couldn t have been more perfect. -TD These are The Last Days of Dark. 
27601 4 simply amazing. not the best in low light. but when it performs it is the best in it s class. 
27602 3 Great product for price. Easy installation easy to save data 
27603 4 Excellent quality for price 
27604 4 Just What I Needed. 
27605 2 Hard to use and didn t work for what I needed it to do. Not good unless you are working outside in wide open environments. 
27606 4 Excellent! 
27607 4 techhelpla.com approved 
27608 4 Good 
27609 3 This glasses is good I love it 
27610 4 I use this all the time. My Go Pro is always hooked to this! 
27611 4 I like the fact that it tightens well and doesn t move from your desired setting. Lots of applications and options with this. I will buy a few more. 
27612 3 No disappointments. It does exactly what the product description says it does. The only consideration is that it is, as advertised, &#34;light weight&#34;. As long as you handle it with attention that doesn t seem to be a problem. It s certainly worth the price. 
27613 2 The batteries get hot. Not so good 
27614 4 Bought for the wife and she loves it. 
27615 3 I haven t used it much yet but it doesn t seem to polarize as much as I hoped for. 
27616 4 I am soooo happy to get this and it works wonders, Thank You! 
27617 4 Very good product. Good price especially compared to the Nikon model. Fast delivery. 
27618 0 Flimsy. Can t hold my Canon 6d. 
27619 4 Perfect fit to Yi Sport. Charges quite fast. Haven t check how long it lasts but will update the review once done. 
27620 2 Some different precut compartments than shown in the picture. As a newbie not vital for me, as I m trying to figure out what I need/want, but if you re buying this for exactly what s shown, you may end up returning it. 
27621 4 Nice set! Everything here is usable and quality product. I would have liked a better case to store it all in together. Glad to see such a combo set available. 
27622 4 Good 
27623 4 Works like it suppose to! 
27624 3 Compared to the pricier monopods like Manrottos, this one seems a good bit smaller in size, which might be good. It s sturdy enough, and great for the cost. 
27625 0 It is a great bag, but way too small for any dslr camera and lens kit. I should have listened to the other reviewers. Now I am stuck with it or buy a bigger bag and lose the money I spent on it 
27626 4 Works as expected 
27627 0 1 star because 0 is not an option. This is not compatible with a sony A230 
27628 3 The product is good, but does not fit in my speedlight. I´ve just bought because of recomendations who bought together. 
27629 4 Easy to install and use. The longest part was the camera installation. ..running the wires through the attic and into the On Q panel. 
27630 4 really nice I got it to use for police harassment that s right!!! I recommend it for anyone who is being harassed imagine for the people who are supposed to protect you. But sadly its the truth. God help this new America. 
27631 4 Nice little case that goes well with my new Nikon mirrorless camera. 
27632 0 This thing will only provide power to the camcorder. It will NOT charge the battery. The red light blinks as if the battery were being charged, but it s visual trickery ! No charge in the battery, regardless of how many hours it is left plugged into the wall. 
27633 4 Worked great. No leaks. 
27634 3 Good 
27635 4 I love this background. Great for packing, stretches well and for this reason no wrinkles. Recommended. 
27636 4 Works exactly as described. Somewhat slow on auto focus, but other reviews mention that. Very pleased for the price 
27637 4 Good quality, simple product, easy to use. Does the job well, no setup involved. 
27638 0 The photos appear too light. I tried several times to adjust the setting, however; the photos still remain too light. The same photos were installed on another name brand, and they look beautiful. My wife and I are not happy with our Micca purchase. 
27639 4 Great charger at a good price 
27640 4 I recommend, fast delivery. very good 
27641 4 Works 
27642 4 It s super gucci i love it it makes my pictures look gr8 
27643 1 Uncomfortable to use... 
27644 2 work great. 
27645 4 works great thanks 
27646 4 Just Great! 
27647 0 It was horrible and does not work. The film turns blue.... Do not purchase this film. 
27648 4 Great extension to my cannon camera. 
27649 4 These little inexpensive triggers work killer. Great purchase. Will be buying a couple more 
27650 1 Could not get it to work on iPhone or ipad 
27651 0 The insert for the pole was no issue. The problem was that it was somewhat transparent and I had a client ask me if it was a sheet from my bed. Not professional. 
27652 2 Very lightweight and easily tilts over...overall a good value tho...lightweight and decent quality 
27653 3 Works good. 
27654 4 Just what I needed for my new Nikon D7100 
27655 4 Camera is just as described and works fine 
27656 4 Excellent 
27657 3 Camera mounts are standard 1/4-20. I use the suction mount on my kayak (with safety line), plenty of holding power so far. the helmet camera straps are basically useless, I had to replace them with the pull to tighten kind. Everything is great otherwise 
27658 4 This drone was outstanding! I could preform flips and fly very high. The drone does not handle wind very well, and is currently stuck in a tree. 
27659 4 It s great I bought this for mountain biking and it has held up through many bumps and some crashes and records great and stays tight. 
27660 4 Great price for quality videos. Easy to use. On time delivery. 
27661 4 Love it 
27662 4 Works great, and the extra dry storage is a bonus. 
27663 4 Glad you offer this plan. 
27664 1 Materials expected to feel better 
27665 4 Very adjustable. Easily get a perfect and comfortable fit. Mountain biking videos are much more interesting from this perspective vs. a handlebar mount. For $13, this is an absolute steal. Quality is very good. Stop looking and just buy this now. You won t regret it. 
27666 4 Good condition! 
27667 0 This filter was delivered SCRATCHED. Not just slightly scratched--it looked as if it had been scraped along concrete. Not exactly what you want to put on the end of your camera lens. THE WORST product I ve ever purchased online. 
27668 4 Good buy 
27669 4 Excellent for the money 
27670 4 Have never had a problem with Hoya. It works as it should. 
27671 4 Worked great! Used it for whitewater and climbing! Adjustable and Seems to have more adjustability than the gopro brand chesty mount. Love the blue also, makes it pop! 
27672 4 I hope not use it. but none one knows it. 
27673 4 YAAASSSS 
27674 4 This is a heavy duty case great for demos! 
27675 0 Worth the price. Maybe 
27676 4 These are nice 
27677 4 This was just what they say it is. I like this because it blocks the sun from hitting the camera so that you can see the shot a whole lot better. Great when shooting from a tripod. I love it.... 
27678 4 Great experience with purchase and a great camera. 
27679 4 I like it. seems sturdy, easy to use, bluethooth connect intantly. will recommend this product to a friend. 
27680 0 This was the recommended size. It did not fit my lens 
27681 3 good .works but a little too heavy 
27682 4 Excellent product for the price. 
27683 4 Delivered on time and fit my camcorder just fine. 
27684 4 I absolutely love this camera! It came with a handy strap and color of the item was true to description. Item was brand new and packaged really well. It takes great shots however just be aware that there s only 10 film per cartridge (not included in purchase). 
27685 4 Excellent product 
27686 1 Extremely small and lightweight das good. However, it pops off its rotating ball far too easy and does not support the weight of a point and shoot camera. Also what if this &#34;free gift?&#34; There was no free gift. Does the plastic bag count? 
27687 4 Great product! 
27688 4 Perfect, during night has a good view 
27689 4 Good adapter 
27690 4 Good! 
27691 2 Simple, plain, to the point, fast 
27692 4 Nice product so far. I ve been having it for a week now and I have no problem with it. 
27693 4 excellent very pleased 
27694 3 Not a bad purchase. It is a bit light and I wish the lens were thicker. 
27695 3 But now it don t work ! 
27696 4 Very nice. We got them to clean DVDs but staff all wanted one for their glasses, too! 
27697 3 Everything worked perfectly 
27698 4 Great filter... 
27699 4 Works great. Love having the extra power. 
27700 3 looks very good outside! very real 
27701 4 I matched this mount with a gorilla-pod tripod holder, and it works great not only for holding photographs, but for holding phones on headrests for in-car video. 
27702 4 Great item 
27703 4 This kit is exactly what I was looking for and needed. Set-up is easy. I know I ll get a lot of use out of this product. Should this not be durable, I ll be sure and let you know. Thanks! 
27704 3 Good for the price. 
27705 4 Bought his for my Canon Tebel T3i Does what it s supposed to! What else do you want? Charges perfectly, no issues. LED light indicates when charging is done. It s compact, no wires. Pins flip out to plug into socket. Very happy with my purchase. 
27706 4 This bag is the perfect size, not too small but super lightweight and easy to carry all your stuff in. 
27707 4 NICE product 
27708 4 Great product. Better than all other baby specific monitors. Will buy again. 
27709 4 IT S the best very BRIGHT strobe flash. 
27710 1 Very average photo s phone in a bag is better 
27711 4 Well made. Does what it s supposed to do, and will last. 
27712 4 Fantastic camera. Cannot tell you anything about the vide as I am a photographer and did not get this camera for video. 
27713 1 Nowhere near as large as described. I returned it since I could not get the gear stashed that was described. 
27714 4 Charger works great, and will definitely purchase another one in the near future. 
27715 4 Very good!! 
27716 3 Works well for the moon. 
27717 3 light, portable, works great 
27718 3 Takes a bit of trial and error adjusting the setting, and maybe a few film sacrifices. Other than that great camera. 
27719 2 The cameras have great video when connected directly to the NVR... unfortunately we could not get them to work wirelessly with my existing wireless network. Tech support responded but could not follow their instructions. The manufacture needs to provide a LOT better and understandable instructions. 
27720 4 great value 
27721 4 Richard 
27722 4 They really look like active cameras. 
27723 0 Could not get this to work with my Canon T5i. Sent it back for canon model. 
27724 4 a 
27725 4 great camera for the money 
27726 3 nice but not very durable 
27727 4 Can t beat the performance for the price. 
27728 4 Awesome lights 
27729 4 This is one of the best deals for this product! 
27730 4 Easy to install and look real. 
27731 4 I love this bag! So happy I bought it!. Its nice and big and I love the color. Great buy! 
27732 3 Lasts longer and charges faster than OEM battery. Using with a Sony AS-100V action cam. Update 5/30/2016: Do not leave the charger or car adapter in direct sunlight. It will straight up melt. If you leave it in your car cover it up with something. 
27733 4 Simple but nice product 
27734 4 A camera made for dummies like me. I love the zoom feature. And I like not having to carry a supply of batteries with me. 
27735 4 It s film and it works. What else can I say? 
27736 3 Great product and works like a charm.. 
27737 4 got a couple of these, i don t know if it deterred and burglar but so far no break in yet. 
27738 3 Does not last as long as I thought it would. 
27739 4 I have taken more pictures and not have to watch my batteries...Ready for my curse. 
27740 4 As Described, recommend 
27741 4 This strap works well with the camera I have. 
27742 3 easy to set up. 
27743 4 I m a beginner, very happy with this stabilizer. It took me minutes to balance it 
27744 4 I love it and wish I still had it. I had to through it away because the top fell off while I was running away from a lightning storm. Anyway, it was great but not durable but I didn t expect it to be for that price. 
27745 4 I really like this camera. It takes really nice pictures, including panoramic and other features. Only complaint is it goes through a lot of batteries. I suggest getting rechargeable batteries if you buy this camera. 
27746 4 I lost my lens cap. This one works. Not a whole lot to say about it. 
27747 4 Fits my DJI phantom 3 pro camera like a glove. Easy and quick to install. Not ackward and cumbersome as the camera stabilizer that came with the phantom. 
27748 4 As advertised; delivery on time. 
27749 4 Fit perfectly and great price.Could not find locally. Was glad to find on Amazon 
27750 0 doesnt fit my sony alpha. not sure what ass backwards connection i was given. dont waste your time! 
27751 4 Excellent !! 
27752 4 Good Price. Works as expected. 
27753 3 What is there to say? .... It seems sturdy for an important modern need. 
27754 4 Great flash bracket, simple an reliable. I will probably replace some of the knobs with something all metal and then these will be as good as expensive manfrotto brackets. 
27755 0 As soon as it arrived I opened it and it was completely scratched on both ends I don t know if they don t put much effort into making these or if I got a used one. Totally dissatisfied 
27756 1 too flimsy, needs to be stiffer 
27757 4 Works perfect! 
27758 3 Good product, but the resolution could be better. 
27759 0 It never worked. I should have sent it back. 
27760 4 Amazing 
27761 4 Simple to use and with the included pocket on the gel holder, the gels will not get lost and last a long time. It s also easy to cut your own gels out of material found at Office Depot. The gel holder fits perfectly. 
27762 4 This works great for taking photos for my online store. The light does suck up batteries so be prepared with some extras. 
27763 4 Happy to have the extra protection. 
27764 4 Works great! 
27765 1 Bad ball head for heavier cameras. 
27766 2 high priced for a dolly that barely holds up my dslr. Next time I will shop around. 
27767 4 nice 
27768 3 This is a nice case. Its vintage and can be used for more than just your camera. 
27769 4 Works as stated. 
27770 4 Excelent. 
27771 4 Captures stunning video. This is my first GoPro so I m still figuring stuff out, but man is this thing fun to play with. Easy to take ANYWHERE and capture most anything you do. Touch screen is a nice, new feature. 
27772 4 Really great picture and package, especially for the price. Took it under water just fine, love it. 
27773 0 Not very liked. It doesn t allow for quick access to the camera and you can t take a quick photo. Protects very well though. 
27774 4 Product quickly re-charged my camera & the extra cleaning kit had everything I needed to take care of my equipment. Thanks you. 
27775 4 I am so happy I bought this, I used it for the first time and it was wonderful. So easy to change the screens. the size is also nice and can be used as a backdrop. 
27776 4 Excellent product. A+++++ 
27777 4 It s a more comfortable alternative to cheap cord straps. It rides about mid-chest on me, which is what I like because whatever is on it doesn t swish around as much when it s mounted higher. 
27778 4 Good Deal! 
27779 4 Awesome original part, in oem package and from slicktron rc, got it first class mail in 2 days, wish I had know would have ordered all parts from them! 
27780 4 works great! 
27781 4 MagicFiber works great for me so far. No lint or fiber material left on the surface of my sunglasses or laptop screen during or after cleaning. I use one of the oversize MagicFiber sheets to polish and wax my guns. 
27782 4 Great product and Service. Walter in support was very helpful in setting up my remote access 
27783 0 Poor quality, and not costly for what is delivered. Poor quality eyepiece optic focal adjustment. 
27784 4 fits fine 
27785 4 Excelent and original piece for my old Minolta 100-300 mm Xi lens!!! 
27786 4 Love it! 
27787 4 simple and easy to use 
27788 4 Absolutely perfect for my needs. 
27789 1 Connections drop when used for a while, battery seems to go dead but actually experincing loose connections 
27790 1 There was no way to choose the color I wanted. I ended up getting gray and white even though the orange was displayed. 
27791 0 I bought this one little a year ago and now it is dead. 
27792 2 It s ok!!!! 
27793 3 Works great. Easy to use and easy to transfer photos to computer. 
27794 4 Works great and easy to set up is you re familiar with CCTV DVR S. 
27795 2 not as cool as i spect 
27796 4 Exactly as described. Great quality paper! 
27797 4 Smooth transaction. Fast shipping. A+++. Thanks!!! 
27798 4 I ordered this item and I must I say I love the design of it as well as the construction. Definitely well built and durable all the way around. I will be combining with other accessories such as the vest and belt but so far its working great!! 
27799 4 Came with a few extra little things that I can hang my pictures with, and a nice little note. Very lovely people! 
27800 3 The pics are clear and it has plenty of options. I was a little disappointed but 360 view in a half sphere is pretty neat. It s a fun little toy. 
27801 2 pretty cheap and ugly but works ok 
27802 3 works 
27803 4 I like having extra batteries on hand for my camera and the fact that this was a 2-pack was better yet! 
27804 4 I love this bag! Perfect size for the camera and everything that goes with it! Received on time and in great condition! 
27805 4 Works better then the original battery. I purchased six of them. So Happy. 
27806 2 I needed it for a micro sized projector.. It works but not without some effort 
27807 1 Works ok for family stuff, but not reliable enough for professional work. It s freezes my camera now and then and the only way to fix it is to take the camera battery out. 
27808 3 Looks good. Have not used it yet. I does not have any decals. 
27809 4 Light and very adjustable. Nice to have the level bubble. 
27810 4 Converting to a monopod the 1st time was a little tricky but I got it to work. Product is exactly what I wanted and is a nice size so I can travel with it and set it up quickly. 
27811 0 Item arrived broken. I was required to pay for the shipping back. 
27812 4 Love these flashes. I use them with the Yungnuo 560 triggers and I couldn t be happier. 
27813 2 Takes a nice picture, but has awful focusing issues. 
27814 4 Very nice product lasts longer than the one provided by Nikon 
27815 4 Good product has a rubber liner on he inside that works great 
27816 3 Works for my wife, price is good, thanks! 
27817 4 Very Good 
27818 0 Received the case and it fits the Samsung camera quite well. This case is going back as it s not made of leather at all. If you want a plastic case buy this one. 
27819 4 High quality images using my Canon 70D. Incredible sharpness. High quality construction, feels very solid, great feel to the focus and aperture rings (fully manual) beautiful appearance as well (love the giant front element). 
27820 0 My experience with this item was not good, as the performance was way below expectation. 
27821 4 Cute and quaint. A role of film is about 20$. 
27822 0 Neither device would trigger the flash no matter what setting the camera was set on. 
27823 4 Excellent looks very real 
27824 4 Geat replacement screen. Will look great once i put it on my old gameboy color. Great product. A++ seller 
27825 4 Works great, and at a great price! 
27826 4 Such a great camera for beginners especially! Easy to use while still producing quality photos and videos. 
27827 4 Looks real enoughat a distance. 
27828 4 Simply awesome. Charges my 18650 batteries very quickly. 
27829 3 This did exactly what it said it would do, and seems to be pretty solid construction. It doesn t feel like a lightweight piece of junk. Some things like this feel like really cheap plastic, but this one does not. 
27830 4 Works perfect it was a gift for my girlfriends mom and she loves it takes it fishing camping to the beach always gets it wet and it does perfectly fine 
27831 4 Great battery. I bought two extra ones when I purchased the Q500+ which gave me four batteries and ensures me at least 1-3/4 hours of flight time on breezy days and up to 2-1/4 hours on calm days. 
27832 4 Nice items. Just as spected 
27833 3 just what i expected. and it is simple to use 
27834 3 Works great! But I would recommend getting a better GoPro pole. But 1 problem I always open the case upside down:) so you need to mark the top. 
27835 4 These work pretty good. I use the smaller ones for my old binoculars and one of the bigger ones for my range scope and they fit and fold down just fine. Easy to stretch and fit! 
27836 4 The battery works great,also I m using it in my battery grip for my d60 Nikon and it works flawless 
27837 2 The rings seems to be dropping colors on the box itself. Not sure will it drop further? 
27838 3 Great mount and allows me to position the camera in a multitude of ways with ease. Deducting one star because the one I received was only able to go side to side, not the side to side and front to back as pictured. 
27839 4 Very nice bag, it works perfectly with my Zipshot MINI. Please note it will not fit the larger Zipshot tripods. 
27840 2 The moving(swivel parts) make the camera rattle around to much. 
27841 4 Excelente 
27842 3 Great 
27843 3 all good ingredients. very help first. 
27844 4 I got my moneys worth,keepup the good work. 
27845 3 Had to return the first one due to communication problems between the remote and the drone. They promptly sent me a new one. I was pleased with that. Other than a few technical glitches, I am enjoying the DJI Phantom 3. 
27846 2 camera is great, accessories not that good 
27847 4 Perfect for a new YouTuber like myself! 
27848 2 it is okay and good 
27849 4 Great quality. 
27850 4 !!!!**** Fits the Fujinon XT17 x 4.5BRMK14 lens for a Panasonic HPX 370 
27851 4 Good 
27852 0 Where are all these 5 stars coming from? These cloths leave more lint behind that what they remove! Or I must be extremly picky but Im not happy. Others work better do more research. 
27853 4 Performs as presented ,great camera for long trips. 
27854 4 Inexpensive and lets me keep my go pro going all day at the track. 
27855 1 Everything was shipped and came on time, but the quality of the items were horrible. Everything that had to do with the lens (hood and attachments) did not fit the camera at all. The tripod is cheap quality as well. I am pretty disappointed by the turnout. 
27856 3 Easy and fun camera to use for the price. 
27857 3 great for the price. 
27858 4 Cheap, works as expected 
27859 3 works better than I thought it would. Beats paying hundreds for a Coolscan. 
27860 4 Great product and the quality of the pi8ctures are great 
27861 3 Good 
27862 4 Nice camera! 
27863 4 No instructions but easy to figure out. Great product, great shipping. 
27864 3 It is OK, but I am not blown away with the quality. I guess you get what you pay for. The shoulder holder is definitely not the best part on this rig. 31/2 star. 
27865 4 Great, works as anticipated.. Only wish it were a tad cheaper. 
27866 4 Good product, works great. Like the separate packaging, Threw a couple in each glove box for my glasses. 
27867 4 Used this on an adventure course near Lake George. Worked great. Was worried it would stay on throughout the rough course. The little grippies worked fine. Glad I purchased this 
27868 4 COOL!! 
27869 3 nice light...at a very inexpensive price...you get what you pay for though...the stands are cheap...and the light hoods don t collapse for easy travel. But still a lot for a little. 
27870 3 Well made and strong, sturdy but unfortunately the shape of the handle bars prevent it from fitting good so cant see the phone but still a good product. 
27871 4 Great Cameras... Best for reliability if you need to do remote monitoring of your house. 
27872 4 Great case! 
27873 3 Great way to organize the stuff I have for the pelican case. 
27874 4 Arrived on time as described. I installed it and had my alarm system back up and running. 
27875 4 This item was a gift for my daughter. She said to give this a 5 star rating ! Very pleased ! 
27876 2 It s a little heavier than the one I have at home. You can only use this MANUALLY. Other than that, I thought it was okay. Add in a diffuser, and you re good to go. 
27877 4 This worked our perfect for my T3i!! 
27878 3 I am very pleased with the product and the service. 
27879 4 It is a lot of fun for the money. 
27880 4 Love this lens, clear pics and f/2.8 makes it great in low light! 
27881 4 Yes! I used this to go on ZIPLINE with a video camera. I used both straps connected to one camera for certainty of control. Worked Great! I removed one of the Metal screw on camera bases, and just used the lockable hook of one of the straps. 
27882 2 It was great until the waterproof aspect failed and we had no luck getting a warranty replacement, as &#34;Kodak&#34; does not really make this product. 
27883 4 I love it!!!! 
27884 4 Will keep your GoPro from sinking to the bottom of the lake or ocean. Worth the price for peace of mind. 
27885 4 I ve had this camera for a long time and have never had a problem with it. Great purchase 
27886 4 Pretty nice lens for the money......you have to run it in manual mode but once you play around with f stops and shutter it s pretty nice. It even took nice pictures of the moon. Very satisfied 
27887 4 Very Good Tripod for price! 
27888 0 You would think this would be a no-brainer, but despite following the poorly-translated directions, I haven t been able to make it work yet. I think its simply defective. 
27889 4 Great training drone, easy to fly. Small enough for indoor use. It can really take a beating. You will need additional batteries for a good flying experience, the batteries last 7-10 minutes per charge. 
27890 4 Puts light right where you need it... 
27891 1 No comment. 
27892 4 amazing customer support, excellent product at a great price! Support from AR004216 was incredible! 
27893 3 Accessories are great. I had hoped the case had a permanent insert designed for the Go-Pro but it was just a foam insert that falls out and slides around too easily. Still a great deal. 
27894 3 Fits phone. Arrived promptly. Only difference is my original one had foam and was slightly more comfortable. 
27895 0 I ve owned this product for a little more than 6 months and used it for roughly 10 shoots: It has been finicky for the last two shoots, causing one to be cut short, and has now stopped working all together. Don t waste your money on this garbage. 
27896 1 Question: I have taken pictures inside and outside, close and far away, most come out blurry. It has the smart auto and smart flash settings on. I am not knowledgeable about cameras which is why i bought one with the auto features. Am i doing something obviously wrong? 
27897 2 could do without the rubber in the middle of the view finder 
27898 3 Nice, rugged little bag. Tight fit for my Canon PowerShot D30, but OK. Would hesitate to put more stuff in the bag, such as SD cards or cables. Several options to carry: neck/shoulder/wrist strap or belt clip. 
27899 4 This tripod mount works really well. Would have benefited from instructions on how to put it together but I eventually figured it out. 
27900 4 Really don t think you can find a better tripod for cheaper! Bought it (and a binocular adapter) for use with my astronomy binoculars and I couldn t be more pleased. 
27901 4 Great professional stuff. 25+ years in the alarm business, but don t do it for a living anymore. I swear by it, 
27902 4 Wow! This is one of the cutest and best deals. You get everything in the picture and they re all super cute. Can t wait to use it. Packaging was nice and arrived sooner than I thought. I highly recommend this deal. :D 
27903 4 I bought this product for some tabletop product photography. I needed a white, seamless background and diffuse light. This product worked great, especially for the price! I paid $20 and would happily do so again. 
27904 4 The camera was exactly as promised and i have loved it immensely. It was a good price for the camera, and it has been rewarding to me. 
27905 3 Great deal. Far exceeded my expectations. Great starter if you re really interested in photography. 
27906 4 Excellent product , really improves vision in bright sunlight. 
27907 4 Does the job. Great price. No issues here! 
27908 0 No life at all. Went dead with in an hour of use... 
27909 4 Awesome 
27910 4 Works as advertised 
27911 2 Just stopped working 
27912 3 This is not the described pink I was expecting. Although the color is more a salmon/coral shade, it is OK. 
27913 4 The camera is excellent, and the package included tons of things that made a great choice. 
27914 4 The camera is long gone, but the case is indispensable. 
27915 2 Like the camera, once I got it set up. It however took me 10 hours to set up a website and set up router. I am not tech say, had to watch YouTube to get it done. 
27916 4 It is affordable and works as intended. Might need a bath when you first get it, but not a big deal. I would order it again. 
27917 4 It works as it should. 
27918 2 It takes wonderful photos. Frustrated that I can t get the movie button to work (that means no shooting video). 
27919 4 One of the best camera bags I have ever owned :) 
27920 4 Well made, easy to use 
27921 3 works very well 
27922 2 Works well if you know what to do with it....LOL so really cant say. But looks nice and installs easly. 
27923 4 lots of storage 
27924 4 Great thanks🌸🌸🌸 
27925 4 RECEIVED IN SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. WOULD RECOMMENED 
27926 4 I filled mine with heavy cat litter inserted into ziplock bags first. 3-6 pounds on each side does the job. 
27927 4 ♡ 
27928 4 Love it. Very easy. 
27929 3 All parts were in orders. Nice small camera for travel. Easy installation and download. 
27930 4 A versatile lens with great glass. I use this lens for everything from portraits to landscapes and have no complaints about its performance. Only praise. On the pricey side, but you get results. 
27931 3 A little too small 
27932 4 great 
27933 4 Only thing wrong is it is a little wiggly but it stays close to zero all the time 
27934 4 Great quality, fast shipping. Performs as needed and appears to be of solid construction. The first float I had, the stitching came apart where the camera hooks to the float. A lot of good that does to save your camera from sinking.Float held my Nikon perfectly. 
27935 4 Thank you the batteries and charge, perfect for my camerar. It will give me additional time to take pictures. Now, I will need an SD card with extra storage. 
27936 4 I lost the original hot shoe cover on my Olympus OM-D E-M1 and purchased this as a replacement which fits perfectly. Since is made of rubber, it has not accidentally fallen off. 
27937 0 It was really great at first but one trip to the beach got it rusting pretty bad. 
27938 4 I was very surprised at how easy and simple it was to use. It keeps the great quality of pictures. 
27939 4 A nice kit for your DSLR. Filters really make a difference in the quality of your work, and also protect your lens at the same time. This is a very reasonably priced kit. 
27940 2 Firmware is not updating over internet.. Certain albums are not displaying. Is there an option to update software by USB or SD card?? 
27941 4 Works perfectly! Don t waste hundreds in an electronic viewer. This is actually better! 
27942 0 Would not work!! Would not connect!! We put it to the side and forgot to send it back!! Never used!! 
27943 4 Exactly fit! And very good quality and fast shipping! 
27944 2 I really don t know what to say, it came in and the part that you screw on to the mono-pod was broken, never did get any answer back from vendor, but it gets you out there to the subject your trying to get a pic of.... 
27945 4 Works great. Cheap enough I bought several. 
27946 0 I was hoping to soften my image a bit, but this just blurs beyond recognition like an 1980s mall photographer. Also its coming from Hong Kong so too forever to get here. 
27947 4 Love this Magnifying Loupe. Had been thinking of buying it for a long time and finally saw a price I could afford. The transaction was easy peasy and the seller was great...no issues....def recommend both this seller and the item. 
27948 3 good 
27949 4 Excelent cam !! 
27950 4 Spot on! 
27951 3 does what is expected, good product. 
27952 2 Neat little softbox for the price. Nothing incredibly but definitely better than using the naked flash. 
27953 3 Works great for everyday photos 
27954 4 Small, adjustable, great picture and sound. Built in microphone has good range and helps eliminate cable clutter. Easy to disconnect to avoid hackers who would use your camera to spy on you. 
27955 3 Have only used one of the batteries, but for one cycle it seemed to match the performance level of the Canon battery. 
27956 4 Is exactly as stated and works great. 
27957 3 Outstanding little camera system with many features. A great value for all you get. Mobile viewing was very easy to set up and the picture quality is good. Too many walls will shorten the distance of reception however the system is outstanding in all. 
27958 4 Does what it says and now I don t have to buy separate filters and hoods for different size lenses! 
27959 4 very good I love it. 
27960 1 Not what I tought it would be 
27961 4 great price 
27962 4 I bought these small binoculars for my Sister who likes to watch birds from her kitchen table! She said they work perfect! She uses them every day! 
27963 3 A+ 
27964 4 yes just what i needed 
27965 3 Great little camera and DVR system, very easy to set up. 
27966 4 Fits the GoPro well! 
27967 4 Makes a big difference in the overall appearance of the camera. It works very well and cost a fraction of the Canon battery grip. 
27968 4 As described and good quality case. 
27969 4 Everything it was said to be! 
27970 4 I combined this with http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VV7JMSC/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=1OABL0D3PBHIE&coliid=IGQJXE3GB584V for a wonderfully complete kit for under $100. The only thing I need now is a quadcopter... ;) 
27971 4 Perfect fit for my Pentax K50 And all the little things to hit the trails 
27972 2 The material is quite good but the smell of the leather is so strong ... this makes me feel uncomfortable. 
27973 4 Good tool 
27974 4 Best BIG umbrella i ve ever used, and the quality of the rods and fabric are well above average. The parabolic dome shape makes a big difference in light control. I threw a 7 Impact diffuser on it to soften the flash even more. Looking forward to shooting this weekend. 
27975 4 sturdy and easy to adjust 
27976 4 A must have for humid climates. 
27977 4 works great 
27978 4 im happy i will put sam pic or video later 
27979 4 Great case, perfectly fit my needs and priced right too. Arrived on time. 
27980 4 Solid construction. Packaged well. Performs as advertised. 
27981 4 Same charger that Canon ships with the camera. Lost mine. Canon wanted 50 bucks for the replacement charger. nuff said. 
27982 4 good 
27983 2 Beautiful strap BUT you better have a small hand. Difficult to get my hand through the loop and I don t have especially large hands. It s a 5 inch loop, needs to be 6 inches. 
27984 0 Just received my gopro today and no sd card but i choose the package with sd card :(((((( 
27985 4 good product 
27986 4 I love this. I was expecting something smaller and it s huge! You definitely need to have a place for this telescope. It is a very sturdy telescope. I haven t gotten to use it yet but can t wait 
27987 4 Excellent!! 
27988 2 The lens is amazing! BUT, I just bought this specific package because the lens hood like in the photo. When I opened I was very annoyed as they are not as described. HOW CAN WE SOLVE THIS PROBLEM??? 
27989 0 camera record in AVI only which is not compatible with 90% of the devices out there. I recommend buying the Wi-Fi version if you would like to actually see your videos. 
27990 3 Works well as a basic, every day lens and fits my close up lens set for use in flower photography. Nice addition to my camera bag. 
27991 2 works as described 
27992 0 My first review was rejected because it was very emotional, well, I will say easier, the device does not work as claimed, I did everything according to the instructions spent more than 3 hours making the one and same action and the result is zero does not work! 
27993 4 just what I wanted, real nice screen to see 
27994 4 My camera and all my lenses fit beautifully in this case. I love the fact that I can just grab it and go. 
27995 2 for the money ok but lots of plastic will fatigue ecome britle and break over time Im sure. More cheap junk from China. 
27996 4 Great for low light and quick photos. We use it take photos inside mostly and it works wonderfully. With just the little bit of light that makes it into the room from outside, we are able to take fantastic photos that look like they were taken with great lighting. 
27997 4 Def awesome does it all 
27998 4 They work great with both my 60d and the 70d. 
27999 0 Broke after one month. Need to return for one that works but is past return period. Motor just clicks but does not move. 
28000 4 Works great! 
28001 4 Exactly what I was looking for 
28002 4 Cannot beat the price on this and goes with my little vintage style polaroid perfectly! 
28003 4 ok 
28004 1 One battery was ok, but the other looked 20 years old. So swollen, it wouldn t fit in the compartment. 
28005 3 Love it! The retractable design makes it easy to carry. The brush is soft and it does the job very well. You must have one if you love your camera lens. 
28006 4 The lens hood work effectively and fits the lens correctly. 
28007 0 Product was useless, and the installation took almost an hour with cable Internet, as fast as it could be, I am still not able to set this camera, the My D-link was pain to find the product. 
28008 4 Please read comment By jnunniv on April 23, 2015. He is 100% correct. I followed his advice and, just as he said it would, it &#34;works like a charm.&#34; 
28009 4 ok 
28010 4 Soft, Gel-feel that you can keep on for hours. Camo is a plus too 
28011 4 So far so good 
28012 3 Worth the money. Don t see much difference I m GoPro brand with length of battery life 
28013 4 great 
28014 4 Fast shipping, great price! 
28015 4 Good Stuff 
28016 3 It does the job it s supposed to do. 
28017 4 [[VIDEOID:6cdee2e305bf59b79ec48101e10270a9]] I have reviewed the Ambient Weather BC-3000 intelligent battery charger and highly recommend the product if you are looking for an all in one battery charger for your home or business. 
28018 4 This is the greatest drone ever. It takes great pictures and videos. I am very happy with its easiness to fly. Definitely an A+ rating. 
28019 0 My cell phone takes better pictures, and my cell phone takes awful pictures. 
28020 1 With 1) a sensor battery life of only 6 months, compared to a Honeywell system of 3 years, 2) No-one that wants to monitor the system. makes this system not very realistic for an alarm system. Spend a little more money and buy a real system. 
28021 4 remarkable range and reach that most users will come to love. The main reason why I fell in love with it. 
28022 4 Like the way it brings out the blue of the sky. Awesome Poduct. 
28023 1 Only half of the picture was color. The other half was black. So much for &#34;rainbow&#34;. This was a birthday gift for my girlfriend... never been so disappointed. 
28024 4 Cute film, awesome colors. 
28025 4 perfect 
28026 3 little small but really protects lens 
28027 4 Very impressed with the clarity and quality of this film. Looks as good as digital but with the character of film... Nuff said ;-) 
28028 0 WASTE OF MONEY! 
28029 3 The quality of the video is fantastic. The microphone for sound is very sensitive to wind noise making the audio during the ride completely useless. 
28030 4 all ok 
28031 3 Works great, decent video quality and easy to set up 
28032 2 Too heavy. 
28033 0 One of three arrived torn. Extra material on the back is great if you need a sun screen, but a pain in the tail to deal with. Likely will cut excess material off. Just not worth it. 
28034 4 worth the money for clarity 
28035 4 Exactly what I expected 
28036 4 Love it, just love it. Simple to install, connect & configure. 
28037 2 Worked as expected 
28038 4 I got the 720p , picture very clear, infare red cool, its like having alight on, visiability only around 30 ft at night. Set up was easy, the only real work is running cable, which has label s, so you can t mess up. we love it! 
28039 4 My Camera is amazing...Maybe a bit overpriced but nevertheless it was worth it. 
28040 1 It s made out of plastic,the unlock bottom is flimsy I m afraid it might get stuck in the long run. 
28041 4 Nice easy to fly toy quadcopter. Great for first timers - like the blue color, I have 3 white ones that I have flown to death. 
28042 4 Just what I was looking for 
28043 2 just so so,it is tiring to change the camera lens 
28044 4 Excelent 
28045 4 The camera was more than I expected. Pretty much brand new with instructions. Completely satisfied with my purchase and this seller. 
28046 4 The battery was the correct battery for my camera and is working fine. Walt 
28047 1 Takes forever to focus whenever you zoom in and the picture will often come out blurry even when it indicates it s focused. Constantly made loud static sounds in the background of videos. Returned it the same week. 
28048 3 Did what it supposed to do 
28049 4 These batteries work beautifully in my Canon EOS Rebel XS. They hold a charge as well as name brand. I got them so I would have plenty of backup batteries on hand and I am so very glad I did. I will definitely buy them again! 
28050 4 I am very happy with the product... Customer service at amazon is the best... Thank you. 
28051 4 usefull to put all the elements of your camera. easy to open and get everything you need 
28052 4 We love our new camera. It took amazing photos of our Smoky Mountain vacation! 
28053 3 We like this camera but it is not doing everything it is supposed to do. It looks like there is some software glitch along the way. 
28054 4 How could you not like these. Five reasons to say thank you. 
28055 1 I bought this based on some of the reviews, one of the review s was a video review and what I got was not the same thing in the review s. I returned it. Later I read some of the other folks had the same problem. 
28056 4 Great for extending cables without have to splice new ones in. 
28057 4 I miss read their ad, but they stepped up and helped me out. 
28058 4 Great product thank you. 
28059 4 Great service Calvin! Camera works well after help from support. They were very responsive. 
28060 3 great little webcam. 
28061 4 Love this backpack. It even has a nice compartment for my netbook. Thank you! 
28062 0 fake gopro product with bad quality cheaply made chinese goods 
28063 0 The video not clear. The sound is bad and nosy. The detect move notification is late. It is realy useless 
28064 4 seems to work well 
28065 4 The lens has it s limitations, but if you know what you are buying it for, it s a great lens for the price. I absolutely love it.

28075 4 Love them and they came on time!! 
28076 4 It is perfect. My identical camera had broken and this is completely like my old one. I love it and it was packaged beautifully 
28077 2 The orange tabs did break, I bought a bag of 24 clamps from Home Depot (various sizes) for a better value. 
28078 4 Holds my DSLR well and protects it 
28079 3 Great product--leads to fun memories. 
28080 4 Great set of filter. They truly add contrast and detail to photos. The case is really good quality as well. 
28081 4 Product as described!! 
28082 4 Excellent product. Multi-element achromatic design provides very high IQ compared to single element close up lenses. Adds flexibility to large aperture zoom or single focal length lenses. 
28083 4 This is a great value !! We love it Very sturdy and great quality 
28084 4 excellent 
28085 4 Amazing product definitely not a fake I highly recommend it. No problems with delivery or the product itself. Comes with a lot of accessories ! Love it !

28089 4 Better than Expected! 
28090 4 Ok 
28091 4 Amazing quality for such a small lens. I love it. 
28092 3 Auto focus does not work with my Sony, but it is not a big problem. This lens lets you get some really interesting shots and people are amazed. 
28093 4 Wow! I truly love this camera body protector. It was just what I needed for my new canon 6D camera. It fits like a glove and it s also very light weight. I truly recommend this product to anyone. Protect your high end purchased. 
28094 4 excellent! 
28095 4 excelent , no problem 
28096 4 Very good product though a little costly. 
28097 3 This was a gift.. Never asked how it went.. 
28098 4 It does what I needed it to do. 
28099 4 Great binoculars for the price. I would recommend using a tripod for astronomical viewing. 
28100 4 I have owned several of these for various camera models. I have even bought them as gifts. I have never been disappointed. 
28101 3 Great product, great details. Not very clear description. The product is not a touch screen. 
28102 4 I LOVE THIS CAMERA. Stepped up from a Rebel T3i (which I love and still use as a backup body). Love the speed and the low light ability. Great pro-sumer camera. Wifi addition is tremendous and allows me to use my iPhone as a remote. Love it. 
28103 3 so far it work good. the only issue is that it won t start recording automatically when power is inserted which is important as I keep forgetting to turn on. 
28104 1 It s too hard to get an item under it to see anything. Can t really use it for the reason I purchased it. 
28105 4 This perfectly fit my needs. Love it! 
28106 4 love it 
28107 4 My product arrived just in time for my trip. I was able to use the covers to protect my lens. I am very happy with them. 
28108 2 The quality isn t GREAT, but it does OK. 
28109 4 I m using these as weather cams on wunderground.com. They handle FTP posting well. Directions are clear and easy to understand. 
28110 4 Great lens, probably not quite as sharp as the Nikon 14-24 but getting really close. 
28111 4 love it. works great and the accesories have exceeded expectations. 
28112 2 Does NOT fit the updated versions! 
28113 0 not working. I followed the instructions and it wont work. 
28114 4 Perfect fit. Love it. 
28115 4 Loved it...wish Flip was still in business. 
28116 4 Ordered for cousin 
28117 4 Very good value for money. All the components were good quality and worked perfectly. Will be buying a second kit for another camera. 
28118 3 Works great. I m only giving it 4 stars because it s aftermarket, and not canon brand. But hey- it s works great, so far!! 
28119 4 Good👍 
28120 4 No problems. Works as advertised. 
28121 3 This was a gift so I haven t used it, my granddaughter loves it. 
28122 4 Good 
28123 3 Works fine 
28124 4 NONE 
28125 3 It works, does the job, not big improvement on using time 
28126 4 LOVE it!!! Exactly what I need and use all the time...outstanding quality! 
28127 2 Not really that helpful but does have many functions spelled out. 
28128 4 Purchase was easy and product arrived on time and worked fine 
28129 4 Works as expected 
28130 4 Works perfectly and seamlessly with my 5D MkIII and my flashes. Exactly what I expected being another great Phottix product. They really are excellent! I would definitely buy again but doubt I ll ever need too! 
28131 4 Easy setup and good replacement for my Izon 1.0 - now i have a night vision - great. 
28132 4 Awesome loved go pro type this video to see it in action 
28133 4 Henry Campbell did a nice job helping me get my camera up and running again after moving. He remoted in and fixed it within 5 minute. Thanks, Henry. 
28134 4 Had to return however, did not fit my camera. 
28135 1 There is no info about camera on internet. Camera works well, but there are no infareds so no night vision and i can not figure how the usd cards works Only way to connect is third party app that does not explain anything. 
28136 4 resistente 
28137 4 Works great. The people that posted negative reviews just don t know how to use this. Don t set on max setting and manually prefocus if you have to, or set at lowest setting, auto focus and only then adjust ND ring. 
28138 3 Works great for cell phones, quickly charges and can recharge a cell phone many times between charges. 
28139 3 The tripod works great. It came very fast. This tripod does what it is supposed to. Great for its price. The travel case, however, came defective and the material is not good quality. 
28140 4 Worked great. Batteries corroded when left inside though. 
28141 4 Good 
28142 0 Crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap 
28143 2 Generally good, but focus is erratic and sometimes you get poor pics. 
28144 4 Easy to use, glad to have it while being on our tropical trip (boating, fishing, snorkeling)! 
28145 4 Great kit, the pad is nice and the belt is easier than putting on your own belt. 
28146 2 was used and missing the brkts for attachement. besides that it won t just fine 
28147 4 works great easy to set up 
28148 4 Easy to install and it works very well. Best price you can find online. 
28149 4 This plate is an exact match for my Ravelli APGL3 tripod. 
28150 4 Once I started using these for location shoots, I ll never stop. I absolutely love the results with my speedlite. 
28151 4 Shipped a large fragile and valuable sculpture in this. Pelican products are simply the best - built like a tank and flawless quality and design of every detail - clasps, wheels and handle are all outstanding. Not cheap but you will never regret having any of these cases. 
28152 4 tHE CAMERA LOOKS GREAT BUT MY GRANDAUGHTER HAS NOT USED IT YET. I THOUGHT FILM FOR THE CAMERA WAS IN THE &#34;BUNDLE&#34; & SHE NEVER SAW IT. AM I MISTAKEN/? BARBARA K MC CORMICK 
28153 4 Love it 
28154 0 I receieved the first one it did not work at all. Then the second one I rec d only one side of the charger works. It appears that the terminals inside are very poorly attached and just fall loose from shipping. Quality is very poor. 
28155 4 good product, price and company. 
28156 1 As other reviewers have stated the cloth does leave excess lint behind. 
28157 4 My Phantom2 is awesome!! Easy to fly without any experience! 
28158 4 Good quality 
28159 4 keeps the neighbor from parking in my driveway when i m gone. 
28160 4 Very good and useful to use the telescope out of city. 
28161 4 Works great. 
28162 4 So much stuff for a really great price! It came just in time, tomorrow I have a ghost investigation so gonna try it out !! 
28163 4 Works great,no probs yet,I m happy. 
28164 4 These Sony tapes work very well in my Sony Handicam Digital 8 camcorder. Output is in nice, clear video. I have used this camcorder and these tapes to record my grandaughter s birthday party and make an excellent DVD from them. 
28165 0 Non-standard thread size and ilconcieved proprietary clamp mechanism make this flag too flakey to trust on any shoot. If you have spare room on a cage or rig, lots of time and odd parts maybe. 
28166 3 Best digital camera on the market, hands down. I ve played with and used almost every brand and functionality out there and this one won my heart. Too expensive. 
28167 3 Be real careful mounting ,adjusting , the arms-mounts are very delicate , flimsy, once up near my real ones ,they look good, and may not be detected as fake, 
28168 4 Had sum questions of if it s 1080p but it is a good pictures 
28169 3 good quality but it s abit big for women wrists 
28170 4 works flawlessly 
28171 4 Easy to use durable and reusable. 
28172 0 Worked well for short period of time and then died. 
28173 4 Good flash.. delivered as promised.. thanks... 
28174 4 it is awesome 
28175 4 Works perfectly great. Seems really solid for anything we d ever need it for. Holds steady and turns smoothly. 
28176 3 as described good product 
28177 4 Nice product, all is well 
28178 4 Nice, but not quite long enough! 
28179 4 Handy gadget, works great, love the little storage compartment. 
28180 4 Comfy!! 
28181 4 dope lens you can t beat an F2.8 plus its made of strong material kinda heavy too which is good 
28182 2 It s okay. But I find the phone apps to do more! 
28183 4 Keeps your GoPro from sinking to the bottom of the lake. Covers back door completely. Includes the two tether mounts/anchors, not the surf mount, as depicted in the first photo. 
28184 4 A lot of fun. Easy to use. However I now want an upgrade. 
28185 3 Fine product, not sure how good this glass is but it works and my pics look a lot crispier and warm and I get to show the awesome blue Florida and Puerto Rican skies and puffy clouds. 
28186 0 Arrived with tear at the seam. 
28187 4 Works just as described! Incredibly simple to set up, and I love the function and aesthetics of it. Will probably add more! 
28188 3 The camera 📷 works great. 
28189 0 Got the cord and it doesn t work. I had to buy another one from best buy. 
28190 4 GReat price great service 
28191 4 Just as expected...added to my home surveillance, works great. 
28192 4 Great Product 
28193 4 Product just as expected, would use seller again. 
28194 0 I received the items before the target but 3 out of 9 were no working. 
28195 4 Excellent binos. 
28196 4 Worked perfect. Used over-sized bulk black paperclips to hold to Cowboy speed light stands and did my first green screen video. Worked perfect. Easy to store between video shoots. 
28197 4 Gud 
28198 2 It s okay, some vignetting and the outside is a little soft. I can t really complain because it was $250. I love h the wide angle though. 
28199 3 I like the 8-in-1 gopro kit, it arived pretty quick. The only thing is that the straps for the chest mount can be a little small if your a big person. All in all cool to have. 
28200 3 worked well for paint ball mask 
28201 0 not the right one 
28202 3 what i needed 
28203 3 for tus price its a good buy. 
28204 4 Love this alternative to pocket wizard. been using mine for a year. I have 6 and, they are reliable cheap and easy to use. I found a few youtube videos and had it all figured out from there. 
28205 3 It is very functional and very well protected. 
28206 4 This item was a gift for my 15 yr old granddaughter in Texas. She loves it!!! 
28207 4 excellent! 
28208 4 This has to be the best camera in the market. Pics are sharp, performs great in low light and with 32MP you can crop like you had a 500mm lens. Lots of options, intuitive to use (for an FX DSLR). 
28209 3 Nice quality. Good price 
28210 4 Delivered on time with great packaging. Items were as described and definitely a great asset for my photography! 
28211 3 Works well 
28212 4 Good Seller and Product 
28213 3 Had a few cosmetic issues, but lens seems to be in great working condition. 
28214 4 This unit works as expected. Great quality, built well with perfect connection to batteries. No longer have to worry about having access to AC power! 
28215 4 Very fast shipping and very happy with it. 
28216 4 Great product. 
28217 0 Garbage, don t waste your money. 
28218 4 A dream lens on my D700. Big and heavy and built like a tank which may be an issue for some weight wussies out there, but hardly a concern of mine; I appreciate build quality. Very sharp, great contrast and color saturation. 5 stars all the way. 
28219 4 Legit. Convenient. Easy to use. Smart design. Practical. Follow me on Instagram @heyitstony 
28220 3 Received this in really fast time, and as pictured. Had to mess with it a bit to get it on, but the extra filters I purchased fit fine. No real complaints. Would purchase again. Thanks. 
28221 4 Love these Wasabi cells! My GoPro 4 Silver does through a battery pretty quickly. A whole day of photos and videos is about 3 batteries worth. 
28222 4 This is a great case and perfectly designed for the dji Phantom 2. The drone and all of batteries, chargers, and miscellaneous pieces fits perfectly. It s very well built, lightweight and is what I had hoped for. 
28223 4 everything was ok. Thank you! 
28224 4 Good quality 
28225 4 I pulled it out of the package and plugged it into my wall. I then put a battery in the charger. It charged the battery like it was supposed to, even on off-brand products. Works great! 
28226 4 Husband likes this case because you can t see in it plus no one knows what it is. He also like it because it s very small. 
28227 0 RETURNED THAK YOU 
28228 4 Works so well I had to buy another! lol The picture is very clear and very wide. 
28229 4 This is definetly a must have product! 
28230 0 Product arrived deffective, with one loose leg, like there is a missing screw or something. I needed it for my vacations, what a waste of time and money. 
28231 4 Perfect solution to watch your pets and your loved ones at home. I found out that my dog just sits and waits near the entrance of the apartment from the moment I leave until the moment I come home. Amazing. Almost cried. 
28232 4 Worked splendidly. 
28233 4 very good.... 
28234 4 Awesome camera We took it on an 11 day safari with a six year old and 64 year old Grandmary. Easy to use n awesome shots were taken with the zoom. We took 1084 shots n kept 200. 
28235 2 Does NOT fit Canon M series. There were two questions on here answered saying that it does. I bought it and can confirm it doesn t fit. 
28236 4 Great all work fine 
28237 4 nice quality 
28238 4 Easy to fit on the handle bar. the actual GoPro holder can be removed from the handlebar holder what leaves a small peg on the handlebar 
28239 4 It meets my expectations does everything I thought it. Very pleased with the product. 
28240 4 I loved 
28241 4 very nice great value , perfect for those quick shots w/o using a slr. 
28242 4 This adapter is life. Works perfect! 
28243 4 It was lovely. 
28244 4 excellent 
28245 2 The quality is low but you get a lot with the deal. 
28246 2 good outside bad inside 
28247 3 Good price compared to battery stores 
28248 4 thank you 
28249 4 Works as advertised. I like the charger being independent from the camera. Have not fully cycled the batteries yet but don t expect issues. Also provides 12V. charging. Much cheaper than others. 
28250 4 takes fantastic pictures, model is a little older now, but cant beat this camera at this price point. Do not hesitate 
28251 4 Very nice filter set. 
28252 4 I love this Air Blaster..easy to use...no problems at all... 
28253 4 Richard. did a great job helping me set up port forwarding as well as email triggering.......10 Stars !! 
28254 4 My 18 year old and my 13 year old traveled to Toyko Japan and Manila, P.I. for the summer vacation. My teenager daughter got awesome videos using the GoPro while riding the wooden sailboats in the Phillipines. 
28255 4 great for the price 
28256 4 Seriousity and fast shipping!! 
28257 4 Just what I needed! 
28258 4 This is exactly as described. I bought this as a second battery for my camera and it is better than the original in that it lasts longer. The charger charges both batteries fine. 
28259 3 Does what its supposed to. 
28260 4 nicccccce! 
28261 4 Love it, but two weeks later and I still cannot figure out the instructions for downloading. 
28262 0 Not what I was expected. Came without any parts or helping page how to use it and how to see your pictures. This is our way to our future. Will be a disaster as planned by the experts in Washington, D.C. 
28263 4 Used on my panasonic dmc-fz70 camera. Fits perfect and pictures/video are great. Like that it protects the main lens. 
28264 4 Absolutely perfect, great price! Thanks! 
28265 4 Does what it is supposed to 
28266 3 its very good for taking photos but not good for videos. very smooth 
28267 3 A bit bigger than I expected, but works perfectly. I really like the fact that it can be plugged in directly in case the batteries in the receiver do die. 
28268 4 nice 
28269 2 It served the purpose. 
28270 4 Here s the bottom line: people wave at it as they walk by. :-D 
28271 4 Batteries are just as good as the original Nikon battery. I really love the travel charger. I keep a spare one in my suit case so I never leave home without one. I highly recommend. Shipped as promise I would purchase from this seller again. 
28272 4 Excellent Camera, Thanks. 
28273 0 It s very difficult to get off. It does wok but I wish it was machined better. 
28274 3 Omly wish it had beewn waterproof. Excellant telephoto and video. 
28275 4 Fit is very very good. Would buy again. 
28276 3 Very nice camara 
28277 4 cool looking 
28278 4 Awesome purchase!!!! Came in fast and everything is wonderful quality! Def would buy again 
28279 2 video/audio quality were good. i liked the product until the only button on it broke from pressing lightly. it was useless after that 
28280 3 works great 
28281 4 Fits like a glove, keeps out dust and protects the connectors on my a6000 flash shoe. 
28282 4 does what it is suppose to, and its made of metal. 
28283 3 Got this for my husband discounted to review. My husband has a canon camera but it didn t fit so he gave it to a friend who has a Sony. The friend says it works well. But the adapter does not work with all canon cameras. 
28284 4 versatile unit and easily achieved the position i wanted. 
28285 4 Great camera and the quality of the lenses are out of this world 
28286 4 Great--fits snugly and makes the camera look better, too 
28287 3 Works well. Cracked easily when dropped and now doesn t float well. 
28288 4 Everything perfect! Thanks! 
28289 4 You ll look a little silly with it since it s so huge but your camera will stay dry. 
28290 4 Takes clear pics. Great video! Small, portable, and powerful. 
28291 4 Amazingly sharp cutting wheel that will trim such a small sliver of paper from a photo if I didn t position it correctly the first time I cut it. Love that! 
28292 4 Nice polarizer, nice price! 
28293 0 They didn t work on my Kindle 7. 
28294 4 Excellent product.. it helps me a lot since I m new with my camera so I use it a lot... for me it s perfect to have more than one battery to use. Thank you! 
28295 4 Works great for a fraction of the price of the orion brand. 
28296 4 Great Camera Bag. Bought one as a gift in 2012 and the bag is still protecting the camera and lenses. 
28297 4 Exactly what I needed so I m not constantly changing lenses. The &#34;leash&#34; for the lens cap is a sweet bonus. I have &#34;lost&#34; the cap so many times in my travels. Also, the bag is well-padded and perfect for my Nikon and the new lens. 
28298 3 It s made out of plastic not carbon fiber. While not perfect, it will give some protection. 
28299 3 The backdrop is exactly how it looks in the seller pictures. Pictures can out looking great. Recommend this item. 
28300 4 I realy like my new Phantom!!! Thanks 
28301 2 WORKS GREAT BUT A BIT SLOW TO CHARGE 
28302 4 Awesome! use as a security alert. 
28303 4 FANTASTIC UNIT 
28304 4 This filter is working very well. I ve read where some photographers have had a problem unscrewing a filter (not necessarily this one), so I don t tighten it down all the way as with all of my filters. I m very happy with it. 
28305 0 bad. very bad. didnt charge my battery. went to a wedding to shoot, popped out the battery, and it hadnt been charged. the design is bad too. the battery easily falls out of the charger. 
28306 4 Works great but make sure you either carry a tool that will loosen these. They work so well with the gasket that sometimes your hand strength isn t enough. 
28307 3 it works great.pain in the butt to get set up right but with a home security system you will have that 
28308 4 Came quickly and as described. Worked perfectly for my Canon Powershot 
28309 4 Bought for my mother as a birthday gift. She loved it an it s many capabilities.The touch screen makes it very user friendly. Great resolution and IR mode. Very pleased with this product. 
28310 4 this part finished off my telescope. perfect 
28311 4 Works great with my 18-135 canon stm 
28312 4 Purchase inspired by Ken Rockwell review; it s totally awesome for power, compactness, and utility with a consumer-grade D3300. The price was painful, but the product was worth some of that premium. 
28313 4 Excellent 
28314 4 Fits my Canon SL1 with standard 18-55mm lens, battery charger, and USB chord. Tight fit. Good compact case. 
28315 4 Did what it was designed to do. But the product that I used it for (not a Sony product) did not work out. So I sent it back, along with the defective camera. 
28316 4 It worked great 
28317 0 Uncomfortable and pointless. You cannot comfortably take image with your hand in this thing with a D3300 
28318 4 Needed a back up battery, fit the bill nicely. 
28319 3 as advertised 
28320 4 I liked the product, and had no trouble with the purchase. thank YoU! 
28321 4 Thanks 
28322 4 good complement with the purchase of the quadcopter I recommend this a lot 
28323 1 Waterproof case doesn t work, water got in and now it doesn t work, never opened. Screen turned greened after 1 use 
28324 3 Thanks to Joseph badge #AR004204 for the set up help, product works great! 
28325 4 The case is attractive and compact! Like the feel of it and the utility! 
28326 0 Couldn t get a picture to show on the screen. Directions very poor. Tried some you- tube video instruction to no avail. Toshiba laptop should work with it but doesn t. Emailed Protensic but never got an answer. Don t know what else to do. 
28327 4 It s really great, but after some work in events I m not using because it s heavy without the chest acessory. 
28328 4 5 generic-brand lens covers for for my camera for less than 1/4 the price of one of the name brand. Fantastic! 
28329 3 Great product just wish the case was a little bigger 
28330 0 it started to shake. I barely used for 5 times. 
28331 4 Love it great light great customer service from seller great experience all the way around 
28332 1 When I was trying to download the firmware files. The wifi from bebop drone keep saying. Impossible to connect. It toke me about 30 mins to download the firmware. :/ 
28333 0 If I could rate it lower I would. It was a complete waste of money. Worst video quality you could imagine. I should have known better trying to save a buck. 
28334 4 Works great! Quick delivery. 
28335 4 They work really good 
28336 4 I like so much. Yellow bobber is easy to find in the water. 
28337 3 GREAT DEVICE at an Outstanding Price!!! 
28338 1 Works well as a monocular... however unfortunately it calls itself night vision. It is not even kinda night vision. 
28339 4 These have everyone fooled. combined with some legitimate Brinks security yard and window signs, I think this is a decent deterrent. 
28340 4 Works well... 
28341 4 I am very satisfied with this purchase. The camera is like new and charges itself, I never need to replace batteries as I had to with the old Coolpix. 
28342 3 Strong case but makes some of buttons hard to press 
28343 4 As advertised. 
28344 4 Great! 
28345 1 Worked ok but speakers were not very loud for video. 
28346 1 the fan has a problem, at first everything was fine, now is making a lot of noise 
28347 3 No problem with them.. 
28348 4 Excelente 
28349 4 This filter is remarkably constructed. The build, quality and and overall construction is excellent. It screws on nicely onto the lens and fits snugly. The coating is even and of high quality. Breakthrough Photography really makes great filters for a great value. 
28350 4 Great product and fast delivery. Look forward to next time 
28351 3 I ordered this battery for my Nikon D7000 and put it into a grip. Used it for a night time star shoot and had no problems. I ll know how good it is after a few months of use but so far so good! 
28352 4 I still have this canon camera and still use it for everything! it is so simple if you just like doing simple video and photography. And you can change the way it looks depending on what size lens you buy. 
28353 4 So far this floating bundle has been great! Easy to use and good qualtiy 
28354 0 Installer said it was a malfunctioning camera. I had throw packaging away so I did not return and counted as my loss. Discourage as a client for future purchases. 
28355 1 Bag was too small for my new 3/4 Lumix 
28356 0 camera did not function 
28357 4 Working good 
28358 4 So glad I bought the extra batteries for my Canon Camera. They keep a goo charge and comes in super handy for those long days of shooting pictures. Great Price as well for the pack. 
28359 4 I am amazed with the quality of service and as well as how I received my order 
28360 4 fitted perfectly on an om-d em5 even if its not listed as compatible, and its really good. perfect as replacement for the original one it may already broken 
28361 2 Really hard to rotate at times. does not bend forward and back well. It is fine for the price it is at. Will get the job done for low cost 
28362 0 Part of the head fell apart when I went to mount the camera! I returned it and got my refund back 
28363 4 Got it delivered very quicjly and it is perfect for me. As a photographer, it s so nice to have something so comfortable on your back! 
28364 3 Received the case which I like a lot it makes the camera look very retro ad offers good protection. 
28365 4 works great. I use it as an access point. Setup is very easy 
28366 0 DO NOT BUY THIS TRASH!!! IT TOOK FOREVER FOR ME TO GET AND ITS NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE IT WAS FIRST OF ALL IT IS USED AND NOT NEW THE PASSWORDS AND USERID DID NOT WORK SO I COULD NOT RESET IT AND ADJUST THE SETTINGS! 
28367 3 cable s a little too short, so buy an extension cord. other than that, It works well. 
28368 4 Buen producto 
28369 4 Thank you 
28370 2 It is a good back up battery. It has a lot lesser charged life... about less than 2 hours maybe. Where the original Lumix can go 4+ hours of photo shooting. But for the price is worth it... 
28371 3 Most of the time works fine, but sometimes you have to re-connect it to the shoes to make better contact. 
28372 4 Good range does come in clear 
28373 2 Good product but it does not screw on my t3i. I heard you need the filter for it to fit I ordered one we will see if it works now. 
28374 4 Much cheaper than Fuji original, fits to camera, looks good, made from solid material. 
28375 3 I m still testing it out. I wish there was a way to turn them off to conserve the battery. 
28376 0 total crap. 
28377 4 This has worked flawlessly, nice looking and sharp images. I use on my desk at work and love the reliability and quality. 
28378 4 Awesome Quality! 
28379 4 Much better than having a camera! All pictures look good! Do not expect real colors, it s like old instant photos. Be careful not to open accidentally the film storage cover. 
28380 4 The seller was quick to respond to my question regarding the type of camera that the case would fit. It does fit the Cannon Rebel 1000D with the 250mm lens. I am very happy with my purchase. 
28381 1 wasn t all that is cracked up to be 
28382 1 The unit has the front red windows was broken, the horizontal movement is not smooth but jerky.The movement is continuous and can not be used for multiple shots into a panorama. 
28383 3 Good for a low budget tripod. 
28384 4 The customer service is awesome and the camera works great. Great picture and set up is easy with videos. Hard to find great customer service today and this company and product is exceeding expectations! 
28385 4 No prob. Good quality. Recommend 
28386 0 Does not operate all that well. 
28387 4 The best camera for adults having to much fun and great for kids too! ;) indestructible!! 
28388 4 Great system 
28389 4 This was a purchase for myself and I have found it as advertised and a good purchase. The seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with. 
28390 2 Can t beat for the money but don t keep a large as long as original brand batteries. 
28391 3 Great Product 
28392 4 Fits nicely, to replace my lost Nikon D5100 battery lid. Don t have to live in constant fear that the battery will fall off. 
28393 4 Seller was great. Very good quality camera although it is just a basic one. 
28394 4 Timely arrival for a great price. 
28395 4 Good 
28396 3 Work good 
28397 0 Lasted about a week. Camera lasted three days. Buy a &#34;real one&#34; if you want a drone. 
28398 4 Quality 
28399 4 Its a camera battery and works just fine as expected for a Canon battery. I have never had it run low, even after 400+ photos in one session, using an external flash, but the builtin. 
28400 1 Not calibrated very well. 
28401 4 kenneth helped me out setting up the camera and camera works great just not as smooth as i thought it would be but everything else is perfectly fine. 
28402 4 Haven t used it in the water yet, but this is a nice, comfortable hand grip. With the wrist strap, this is a no Brainer for water enthusiasts! 
28403 4 Great!.. Thanks 
28404 4 works OK hard to use 
28405 4 Keeps my GoPro 4 going, charges fast with my Anker chargers. 
28406 4 very good 
28407 4 A good product. 
28408 4 Just exactly what I was looking for. Thank you. 
28409 4 Love the ball design ...can angle my camera in abstract way to capture a pic and it captures right every time...also like the ability to switch from tripod to monopod without falling...not a professional photographer but highly recommend this tripod 
28410 4 BESTTTTTT Love it!!! 
28411 4 Its great just what i was looking for. 
28412 3 great product for price , needs better instructions , not Bluetooth cabable 
28413 0 Add stated for phantom 2. However screews included were for phantom 3 only. 
28414 0 Don t use wrist mount the part that spins Broke off when I was on my jet ski and I lost my hero 4 
28415 4 I purchased this item for the Nikon D7200. It s a perfect fit for both the top and rear monitors. Very easy to install, no bubbles, no troubles. Does not degrade the display quality at all. 
28416 4 Bien 
28417 4 several year later and still going strong. love this accessory so much for longer battery life and for better grip. 
28418 0 I was looking for a tripod for my camera and not for a phone. 
28419 4 We took about a days worth of pictures and another half-hour of video (flyboarding) and the battery was just about done. These work great and the charger handles the original battery from my Olympus TG-4. 
28420 0 This is a fun scope to take along any where. I was surprize at how clear and good viewing through it was. I like and recommend all the Orion products. 
28421 1 Worked ok when I was able to use it. Every one of the loops that the strap goes through came off on one end. Super glue doesn t even want to hold them in place on that cheap plastic. You get what you pay for I guess. 
28422 4 love it, small enough to fit in my pocket, takes great pictures. wpi;d recommend to buy it. 
28423 4 Works as described. expensive for what it is, but I really didn t feel like trying to build my own and the cost for dies to cut right and left hand threads, so I paid the price. 
28424 4 O.K. Please send me a Guide to understand better to use it. I need also drawings and guidelines because I have problems to know better to use it. Thank You 
28425 4 The Best...... 
28426 3 works as expected 
28427 4 So glad I found a replacement for my camera, works great! 
28428 4 Love this camera! Not as intimidating as I first thought it would be...takes great pictures, no buyers remorse or disappointment. Very happy with my purchase. 
28429 4 Getting a real canon IS lens at this price is great. It s not as hefty as the more expensive lens, but for the price, it s hard to beat. I find this a must for those interior shots where 24mm and up just don t capture what I need. 
28430 4 Works great! My images look fantastic. 
28431 0 Don t work. Don t charge 
28432 4 Great lengths for the money 
28433 0 Doesn t work for me - cannot see to focus - view is distorted. Trying to return 
28434 4 Excellent remote. 
28435 4 Exactly what I expected. 
28436 4 Worked great for taking pics for eBay 
28437 4 Works great! I ve should ve gotten one of these ages ago! Helps my night photography a great deal. 
28438 3 the L830 is a wonderful prosumer camera sadly the shutter speed is not controllable 
28439 3 Decent camera for price. Quick delivery 
28440 4 The product is exactly what I needed. The speed at which I received the item was very good. Used the item day after I got it and it works great. 
28441 4 Our lights arrived quickly and in one piece. They are bright. 
28442 0 I bought this and 5 weeks after I bought it the base rusted. They expect me to pay shipping cost to get replacement. Bad product, Bad company, bad support. Bad use of money 
28443 4 Perfect.......better than expected! 
28444 4 The battery is just what I wanted. Thanks. 
28445 3 Works over wifi or cell service from any where in the country. It does freeze if signal is weak but you can speak through it and listen to conversations. It is an excellent low budget home surveillance alternative. 
28446 4 So great filters with good price, high quality build. 
28447 4 I am very pleased with the quality of the product, and the price and prompt delivery. A+ 
28448 2 Ok so the selfie stick itself is pretty good and sturdy but.... The go pro attachment snapped off in my hand which was lucky because with what I do it could have been the end of my gopro... An extra $10 later I buy a real adapter which was annoying... 
28449 3 These actually work very well - I now have 4 of them. The product would be better served by the inclusion of instructions that are better written in english; however, that notwithstanding, they perform as would be expected by a more expensive product, and are recommended. 
28450 4 Lost my original charger, this one works wonderful 
28451 4 Fast and efficient. Your batteries exceeded my expectation. Thank you for your great customer service. 
28452 4 It is exactly what I ordered and what I expected 
28453 4 great 
28454 4 great flash 
28455 4 received as expected 
28456 4 High quality and durable, honestly I am very impressed with this kit for the price! 
28457 4 My hope was to trigger my Canon 580EX-II off camera and this bracket is perfect! Most of it is metal with the exception of the knobs and feels very sturdy. Great product! 
28458 4 This tutu is absolutely ADORABLE!!! The quality is great and the color was exactly as pictured. Any little girl will look like the cutest little girl in the world with this tutu abd headband. Highly recommended this product!! 
28459 4 I really don t use it very often, but when I need it, it does perform as expected. It might not feel super sturdy and tough, but taking the price I paid for it into account I give it 5 stars. 
28460 4 Fits my new Nikon P600 camera perfectly. 
28461 4 Awesome, as usual for Canon products!!!! 
28462 4 Well and aesthetically built. Works fine, uses widely available AA batteries. Now all my studio devices run on the same type batteries. Great tool for a studio or outdoors shoots where extra lights are needed. Not that easy to use as it has so many functions. I am still learning. 
28463 0 I bought this a couple of months ago. I am disappointed. When the wifi does work, it will only let you upload 1 photo at a time. It is slow and frustrating. I wouldn t buy this product again. Don t waste your money. 
28464 4 Very nice for the money. Everything fits and works wekk with my Panasonic AG-HMC80. 
28465 0 So happy with it, it is so compact. Also happy that it has a re-chargeable battery. Also easy to use. 
28466 4 Excelente. 
28467 1 Kind of a joke not being able to see any history without having to pay for subscription. It s not a bad camera but not the best 
28468 4 Great price, and works as needed. No complaints. 
28469 4 This was a surprise to me how much I like these. Good enough for my elaborate home studio. 
28470 4 Great price for remanufactured, works great with Amazon oem battery and chargers available. 
28471 4 I got this for my brother and it was really cool! 
28472 2 It works some times and doesn t work other times. I was hoping it was more reliable to use my iPad or iPhone as a monitor when shooting video but it seems to be more of a deterrent than helpful. 
28473 4 AMAZING! 
28474 4 As described. Perfect high quality Galaxy S6 dummy phone. Fast shipping! Thank you. 
28475 4 Great value for the price 
28476 0 Does NOT fit the 55-250 Canon lens. 
28477 4 Item delivered on time and as described. 
28478 4 I m very satisfied with this purchase, because it s exactly what I was looking for. It work perfectly and is the battery that I need for my video camera. I want to Thanks the seller because they still have this kind of products in existence. Thanks. 
28479 4 Very high quality CCD. For the price you can t go wrong. Very good fish eye lens for outdoor. 
28480 4 Very good camera!!! 
28481 4 I don t like typing 
28482 4 Excelent product 
28483 4 Great and fast shipping. Lights are near daylight and perfect for my application. 
28484 4 Does what it is supposed to do, hold the camera nice and tight. 
28485 3 Only issue is they are a bit hard to separate. 
28486 4 Very good film camera. What else could I say? 
28487 3 The color is darker than shown in the picture, but all in all a neat little case. 
28488 1 Its bulky, just not the fit for me. I ended up stashing it behind a tree on a hike, and leaving my camera around me neck, with my extra lense in a smaller bag. 
28489 4 It worked even better than what I had anticipated. I strongly recommended this little but powerful gadget. 
28490 2 on my phone when you plug it in the phone it act like it want to zoom so it doesn t work but I set the time on my phone and use it that way not that big of a deal 
28491 3 Now both my wife and my self have spare battery for our photo trips. 
28492 4 I like how I can start a video shoot right away and not miss the event! Haven t had it underwater yet, is nice size to keep in my purse. TY :) 
28493 4 good seller, I recomend 
28494 4 Definitely a &#34;5&#34; on a scale of 1-5 in the COOL FACTOR Ratings...Adds a little style to my new X100T...Love it! 
28495 4 We are using it for 5 years, and still works as day 1. 
28496 3 good 
28497 4 This works great as other reviewers noted. Still trying to figure out how to set up motion sensor to start recording. Otherwise recordings and snap shots are clear and I love the two way talk. Love to have an outside version of this video cam. 
28498 4 Most happy with this kit. Came with everything I needed The A77II is a great camera.The battery grip helps for extended shoots. Picture examples from the A77II. 
28499 4 Great picture 
28500 4 It work Great 
28501 0 Fail. Bought two. One dead upon arrival. Would not hold a charge. 
28502 4 The person for whom I purchased it as a gift was delighted to have it. 
28503 4 Fits great and gives extra much needed grip to the smooth as silk Rx100 exterior. 
28504 1 Hmm quality of the construction is solid and looks good, but I found that using camera under water and then on sun the lens sweats from inside. Also lcd screen had same issue. All covers was closed and using in normal conditions. 
28505 4 great suport great item, 
28506 4 Works as expected. 
28507 4 great strap 
28508 4 ggreat product 
28509 4 Use these all the time. 
28510 3 can not delete misinstalled Canary 
28511 4 I love this camera. It works great. The staff is very helpful with any questions. 
28512 4 Great it works 
28513 4 Its a smaller size but its really fun and durable! 
28514 3 Really good 
28515 4 We love these little things - they are so economical, we wound up with a half-dozen - even one keeping an eye on the water heater closet. 
28516 4 sturdy, good product 
28517 4 Exactly what I was looking for. 
28518 3 Got it , have not had a chance to use it fully, when looking through it you can see circle s. Don t know if that is normal. 
28519 4 Great camera works well 
28520 3 still working after all this time; and doing it well 
28521 4 Much better than just looking at the screen from a distance. It helps me ensure I get the right adjustment for the light and it can detach since it has a magnet. 
28522 4 my wife loves it 
28523 0 Had it for a few years now. I have literally used it for about the first 3 months then bought me a real camera. This thing is the slowst camera in the world. Horrible battery life. Waist of $300.00. 
28524 3 Very nice! The entire package was much more than I really expected. I am very happy with my purchase. 
28525 4 Did exactly what I needed it to do, help my webcam fit my eyepiece. Couldn t ask any more from it. 
28526 4 So far so good. The product was delivered on the first day of the estimated delivery date for free shipping and packing was good too. Started using it and looks to be a good product for the price. 
28527 4 Works extremely well. Used for bear-detection in the mountains. 
28528 4 perfect 
28529 3 i have some problem on the button using the cover and i expected more from the battery BUT the quality video is good , 
28530 2 Alright part of it didn t work thougj 
28531 0 I m returning/exchanging this one. Doesn t charge from an outlet, only from cigarette lighter in the car. 
28532 4 This lens turned me into a pro. Love it. Easy to use. 
28533 2 The shipping time was ok. The only bad thing was that the instructions booklet and the camera strap didn´t came but I was rewarded for that. Regards. 
28534 1 poor resolution 
28535 4 Good Quality 
28536 4 Easy to setup and use! Very affordable as well. Worked with no issues Nikon D5200 
28537 4 It was what I needed and fits nicely in my camera case. 
28538 0 Fit on my Nikon body but did NOT fit my Minolta lens. 
28539 4 This is a must have if you have a NEX 7. Its great for protection, connecting over the shoulder harness and also easily clipping into my tripod (both landscape and portrait). No regrets. 
28540 3 Great battery for LED lamps... !! 
28541 4 Just what I needed! 
28542 4 Working fine, quick set up and fast service 
28543 3 Strap no good. Glasses were fine. 
28544 4 Perfect Fit for my new Pahntom 3, and plenty of room for the iPad Mini and extra battery. 
28545 4 Works perfect for my needs 
28546 4 An amazing camera. I just shot this music video in 4k and it came out great! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkheLRGWCZU 
28547 2 If the springs pop on you all you need to do is unscrew the 2 screws in the back and align the springs back and its good to go. 
28548 4 Item delivered on time, and works perfectly. Glad to have the keeper leash so I don t lose anymore........ 
28549 4 Best tripod I could buy, works well in all weather conditions. Doesn t float however :) 
28550 0 Couldn t even test out the set because I could only read about 1/4 of the digits/characters on the transmitter screen. NOT recommended. 
28551 2 Bought it for someone else 
28552 4 Great for travelling, the smallest of my 3 tripods. 
28553 2 It was great for about a month, comfortable, lightweight, but the clip broke and luckily I was holding my camera at the time or it would have been a disaster. 
28554 0 I ued this only 3 times, It can t be close-- only last 1 month.lose anymore, so I do not know how I can ship back. This cheap stuff is too expensive for 1 month lifespan. 
28555 0 It does not read, I thought maybe I was using it wrong so I asked the man that put my solar fencing in & he could not get it to read either. He used his own tester and got a reading. 
28556 4 Great case, protects without being bulky and at a great price. 
28557 1 M haaa a 
28558 4 Fine 
28559 4 Good 
28560 3 I love the way it looks like a WWII Leica case! 
28561 1 They ll work, mostly, but do yourself a favor and spend a little bit more. I had one that didn t want to let go of my lens (release button was only semi-coupled to the pin), and promptly chucked the set. 
28562 4 Works as described, have not had any issues yet. 
28563 4 great price 
28564 4 Great deal and batteries worked well. 
28565 4 Great bargain. 
28566 4 Great product. Not too heavy. Perfect for bringing on hikes. 
28567 4 Easy to install, great for security. The camera setting for recording is not totally intuitive. 
28568 4 Bought three of them already!!!! 
28569 4 Works great! 
28570 2 My unit was stolen, but it worked OK when I had it. 
28571 4 LOVE IT, works like the original. 
28572 4 I use these for all my delicate screens, cell phone, TV, and most of all for my navigation and compass clean up. 
28573 4 Easy to install. Works great. 
28574 3 I like it, but be careful when you receive it. The light went out on one side very easily. 
28575 3 This is perfect for what I intended... 
28576 4 these batteries were a good price and works perfect. and came with a car charger and a wall charger. i really needed the car charger. it really comes in handy. 
28577 4 Grate 
28578 4 Very Well Satisfied. 
28579 4 Great camera for the money. The website is convenient too. 
28580 2 Looks too fake-ish 
28581 3 Five star 
28582 3 Awesome... 
28583 4 Product was like brand new, everything worked and even came with a Sony carrying case I wasn t expecting. Very nice 
28584 4 I bought this camera 6 months ago. It was perfect for my needs. I looked at a bug collection that my grandkids found and also used it to watch while my students tied surgical knots. It works great and never had a problem. 
28585 4 Works well 
28586 4 Just as described. Received my camera quickly with no issues. 
28587 2 Works well 
28588 4 Nice design! Very good construction. Camera and accessories fit nicely. 
28589 4 Fits its purpose. No issues. 
28590 4 A good charger at a great price. Small, compact and does what it is supposed to do. Arrived quickly and as advertised. 
28591 4 Good battery,good price,and fast shipping. 
28592 4 Works the same as the original canon battery Good value 
28593 4 This is a really good ket for the price! 
28594 4 Great little case for your GoPro and some accessories! 
28595 4 Great case!! Took it overseas and it held up through a lot of abuse!! 
28596 4 Work great picture come out really nice ... Love it 
28597 4 Exelent product. 
28598 0 Got FV and not the FW 
28599 2 The greatest problem I have with this camera is the battery life. does not last but a few hours 
28600 4 Love. I am still learning some of the features for this is my first nice camera outside of pocket digital cameras. 
28601 3 works as advertised, nice price, seems to be reliable. 
28602 0 I could see the ends of the filter in the frame, its too long. Used with Canon EF 17-40 on full frame body. Didn t like the threaded mounting system either. 
28603 4 Awesome macro lens! I too, am newer to photography and recently discovered macro lenses. The shots I was &#34;attempting&#34; to capture with a standard lens seem a million times easier with this lens, and are much clearer. The price is also very good compared to others. I highly recommend. 
28604 4 The battery arrived fully charged and worked as well as the original equipment one had. Truly a remarkable value when compared with the price of an OE battery. 
28605 1 Video is washed out. Night time ir is grainy. Focus piunt seems fixed even though camer has adjustable focus. Pay the extra 10 dollars and get something better 
28606 4 Very good lens. Close range pictures have really nice colour and depth of field. I 
28607 4 Amazing and better!! Highly recommend this product. It performs better than expected. I did order another battery and a case to transport it in. 
28608 3 My light didn t work but from far away LOOKS REAL enough to fool average thief, the average thief isn t to bright anyway ! 
28609 3 Videos on my GoPro 4 hero turned out just fine! Colors looked good sharpness of video seems fine. The only thing I could see as an issue is the longevity of the product itself but for the money it was great. I would by again if needed. 
28610 4 Work well, thanks. 
28611 4 Great product and nice looking. Great for aero bars as well. 
28612 0 The screw that you tighten to secure the flash is very hard to grip with your finger tips. The first time I used this mount, my flash was on the floor within minutes. 
28613 4 It works great, especially for my camera lens. The grey cloth is the perfect size to keep in my camera bag, and I think I ll be keeping the larger one with my laptop! I would reccomend this product 
28614 4 Awesome value! Pictures turned out great! 
28615 4 The most versatile ruggedly made fun camcorder that you can do just about anything with from outside sport activities there s a very special moments in the home I would recommend this to everyone 
28616 4 Really bright. ...!!! 
28617 4 Replaced a previous model that had worn out over time. 
28618 4 Exactly what I expected 
28619 4 NICE ASSORTMENT OF ITEMS TO COMPLIMENT THE MINI 8 CAMERA. 
28620 4 Nice price and good condition. Highly recommend. 
28621 0 Very cheap quality. Does not fit the tripod. 
28622 4 STK always a winner. 
28623 4 Great product. Highly recommended. 
28624 4 Great simple camera 
28625 4 Good 
28626 4 Works perfectly! 
28627 4 So powerful. So useful. Get this in your camera bag right now. I know people that have 2 or 3 of these. You will not be disappointed. 
28628 4 Excellent product. 
28629 4 serves its purpose really well. 
28630 3 the camera, the lenses, the spare battery, the spare charger, the memory card and the lens converters are alright. I didn t like the flash, the bag and the tripod. The long distance shutter didn t work. 
28631 4 very good 
28632 4 Great! Received as described. 
28633 4 great value 
28634 3 You have moved an old timer into the digital age with this purchase. I m learning how to use yet, but I m satisfied with my purchase. 
28635 4 Great batteries. As far as I am concerned they are very close if not on par with the standard &#34;Canon batteries&#34;. Great Deal. Very Pleased. 
28636 4 So coll 
28637 4 Robust air blower. Never run out of air. No disposable cans. 
28638 4 Well-built, seems sturdy. The GoPro adapter can be unscrewed, leaving a traditional screw camera mount, so it works for other cameras as well. Very pleased. 
28639 4 The HD picture quality is outstanding. I am thoroughly pleased!! 
28640 3 It s a battery 
28641 3 Works well as a greenhouse/fish tank monitor. More resolution would be nice but this is adequate. It connected up at a distance of 40 feet or so from the router. 
28642 4 Very happy with purchase. 
28643 0 the image is not clear an not wide enough, do not waste your money in this purchase 
28644 4 Great price. Fine product. Works as expected. 
28645 0 Bad product but good customer service. I have bought two of these and both died after just a few months. I got a third one for free after I complained but this one also died after a few weeks! 
28646 3 The product works as advertised. You have to make sure the flash clicks into place though or it will not work properly. 
28647 3 Only problem encountered was a defective USB cable. I had to scrounge one from my drawer. The setup and subsequent use is very good. The software is an improvement over Drop Cam and I currently am using two of those. 
28648 0 This camera does not work 
28649 4 Great lense, good for shallow DOF 
28650 4 Clips and holds pretty nicely. Def a great replacement for a stock clip on cap. It was shipped from China, but came in roughly 2 weeks. So all in all... good buy. 
28651 4 This fits perfectly in my backpack to turn the front pouch into a camera bag! This way I can bring other things like clothes, water bottles, snacks, maps, etc. dedicated bags aren t quite as versatile, so this gives you the best of both worlds :) 
28652 4 The studio lighting is great for video and pictures. 
28653 4 Very good and easy to use. 
28654 4 Not bad for the price, it is not as good as original Nikon battery, but as a backup it is not going to disappoint you. 
28655 4 works as advertised! 
28656 4 good product 
28657 4 Very cute background! Looks exactly like pictured. 
28658 4 Excellent product, was everything it calmed to be. Fast shipping, friendly CS 
28659 4 bought to go with camera for 11 year old selfie generation- she loves it 
28660 3 It took me a little while to get everything working according to the instructions, including using sim card from at@t, but I m happy with the system. I did have a bad window/door switch but received a new one after notifying support@pisector. Their support people worked with me very well. 
28661 4 Works great 
28662 3 It works great for the camera and the other pockets will come in handy for something. 
28663 3 It works. 
28664 4 This a quality bag for a bargain price. I use this for a Sony Nex-7, multiple lenses, tripod, and all my accessories. 
28665 3 It works for my camera 
28666 0 Almost impossible to place on dog. 
28667 1 it is hard and inconvenient to connect, let alone keep the connection going. 
28668 4 Great lens, super lightweight, perfect for travel, great image quality. 
28669 3 Works great on my 150-600 mm 
28670 4 Just bought an Olympus underwater camera, used just one of the two floaty included and it works like a charm. 
28671 3 Motion detection doesn t work. 
28672 4 It s a rechargeable battery. It s still taking a charge after 4 years. What else can I say? 
28673 4 Perfect for my 75-300mm lens! Well made case. I love this case and having my 2nd lens right on my hip. I hate having to get into my bag every time I what to switch lenses, this case saves me so much time! 
28674 4 Fast service and good for beginner this is my first drome and is easy to fly...... 
28675 4 good item 
28676 2 Good 
28677 3 Pretty good but i have Android 5.02 which should work with WiFi feature but it does not No way of telling if it really does have WiFi or not. 
28678 4 Used it for the first time on my family vacation. Though I was a little nervous at first but it was an actually good buy. 
28679 4 LOVE THIS!!!!! 
28680 2 This latch doesn t hold as tight as the original GoPro latch and will let water in. GoPro replaced the original broken latch for free even after 2 years. I know keep this latch as a non-waterproof backup. 
28681 0 I ve ordered two of these lights and both begin to flicker after being powered on for about 30 min as they start to warm up. 
28682 4 Good 
28683 4 worked good 
28684 4 Bought 2 of these batteries! Work great in my Canon rebel xti! 
28685 4 Product as described, love it and would buy it again, thanks! 
28686 4 Awesome!!! 
28687 4 Love these reflectors! They pack up nice and compact and fit right in my camera bag. 
28688 4 Happy experience! 
28689 0 This was to be a NEW item. It WASNT. 
28690 4 The Camera is so great, like others in the segment, the accesories kit is fine and usefull but not so well made. Hope all of the parts works properly (425USD) for all was 
28691 4 At first I thought that the camera was going to not be of high quality, but I was wrong. The Fujikam camera has exceeded my expectations and I am very happy with this product. 
28692 4 perfect 
28693 2 It s not easy to use as there is no view finder so you re not really sure what you re shooting and it s very far away and you have to do manipulation on the photo to get a good print before you can post or use the picture. 
28694 4 One of the best values I have ever found. I don t care what others say, Cowboy Studios sells good products at better than affordable prices. If you are just starting out in photography, or a seasoned pro, you can t beat CS prices and quality. 
28695 3 Very sturdy, note that it will fit an unusual size pole. 
28696 4 Camera is still great. 
28697 0 didnt fit for my camera 
28698 4 Thanks Works Well! 
28699 4 It is a great buy !!! I had to return because it was not I wanted not because any problems 
28700 3 very Good 
28701 1 Did not fit my iPhone with the case. 
28702 3 This is a very fun camera, I appreciate Fuji for picking up the mantle after Polaroid, but it is seems a little oversized. In fact it is HUGE. 
28703 4 Love this tripod, very study 
28704 4 Quick and easy claim process! 
28705 4 great case. camera fits in it well. 
28706 4 This fish eye lens is comparable to the actual cannon version but at less of the cost. I have used these lens millions of times and I get great photos. I get great angle shots and lots of different views. 
28707 2 it s small and adorable, but the pictures come out too dark and the resolution is not great, just average. the pictures are misleading. 
28708 4 Looks to be what I needed. Thank you 
28709 4 Good price and very short time for delivery. 
28710 1 Outdated 
28711 4 Worked great, charged my orginal battery,and the battery that came with it. I recommend 
28712 4 Exactly what I was looking for...a camera case that did not disconnect from the camera when the camera is in use. It easily fit my smaller zoom and was a perfect fit for my Canon 35-300 Zoom. 
28713 2 AC Adapter die just after 1 yr 
28714 4 Good 
28715 4 Sturdy and well made 
28716 2 okay 
28717 4 Absolutely the best purchase 
28718 4 This case is bad ass. Sort of a tight fit around the motors (with the new Vortex limiting straps installed). I took pictures and sent the feedback to GPC.. all in all, terrific case 
28719 4 Only played with them slightly, but, enjoying them 
28720 4 Links easily with Honeywell L7000. 
28721 2 This lens is pretty cool. Can t beat the price, and it does just what its supposed to. Its also very lightweight, yet durable. A nice addition to my camera bag. 
28722 4 Got this case for my wife s large Panasonic point and shoot camera. It fit perfectly and had room for cables. Excellent quality bag and my wife loves the color to boot! 
28723 3 Currently using it on a bracket connected to my OMD E-M5 Mark ii and it works perfectly. 
28724 4 does what it says its gonna do 
28725 4 it works really good 
28726 1 I ordered for a Canon D10 and I received a Vivitar Kit. 
28727 4 A+++++, Will buy again! Excellent in all aspects & highly recommend!! Thank you! 
28728 4 love this 
28729 3 Nice addition to my gopro stuff 
28730 4 Works as advertised 
28731 4 Product worked well...it charged the batteries, and a green light indicated when to unplug the charger. excellent 
28732 4 Got everything in this plus a couple extra things. The suction cup is a little small. But zero complaints 
28733 4 I needed these to hold a few old 8x10 school photos and other nostalgic pics of yesteryear! Great protection for important mementos that are strictly 8x10 or smaller (unlike the 8.5x11 page protectors, which are slightly larger). Highly recommended. 
28734 3 True to description! Slim and user-friendly. My only complaint is that the photos are in the same order every time and that the memory card doesn t get inserted completely. There s a margin at the edge, so be careful if packing it with the card stored in it. 
28735 4 This was the perfect solution to my addiction to larger lens for my wildlife requirements. It has plenty enough room and i find comfortable for my use. AAA+ 
28736 4 works great and so much cheaper then the gopro one 
28737 4 Great mount! It can be put on a bar or handle as well as your wrist! Solid quality and trust my contour s life with it. 
28738 2 I thought it was for panoramic photos-it is better suited for close ups where you want a wider shot. 
28739 4 Fits perfectly 
28740 3 This would be an excellent bag/organizer for a GoPro if it was a little bigger. It just doesn t hold enough accessories! 
28741 0 This device a while go open it up yesterday today is the 21st August it don t work I want my money back piece of junk I charged it all night then turned it on and nothinghappen didn t clock did not even come on send me a return slip 
28742 4 good fit 
28743 2 it doesn t fit the whole screen so dirt and stuff collects at the edges. 
28744 4 Great item!. Used it to monitor my feline while away. 
28745 4 Perfect to stabilize my camera and perfect for iPhone when doing Flipagram for stop motion animation. You just need a part to hold the iphone, which you can find on Amazon, too. 
28746 3 Tiffin always axe a decent product. They sent me wrong size for my camera lens. Instead of 40.5 I got a 43.5. Trying to see if I can use it on another lens 
28747 4 Q-See has good equipment. These cables work just fine with Q-See camera. 
28748 4 pretty steady for indoor use 
28749 3 Definitely like this unit, its extremely solid as far as the frame and rods, The motors work ok with my cameras and are a bit noisy but that was expected if they hold up over time I will definitely give this rig 5 stars. 
28750 3 Nice set for the money. Had a hell of a time setting it up but it all works. It s not 5 stars because I m having trouble logging in because the name and password given to me for first log in don t work. 
28751 4 Same performance as the OEM battery at a much better price. 
28752 4 Nice and fresh. 
28753 4 😀 
28754 4 Charger for my Canon camera batteries. You can never have enough. Charged like the original, no overheating and my batteries did not lose the charge as some claimed. Its perfect for what I needed. 
28755 3 Only 9 out of 10 worked, which was disappointing when I had planned to take four pictures knowing I had four films left. The last one printed blank. 
28756 0 Missing some stuff 
28757 1 It did not fit my Sony a330 like I was told so I went to Florida for a week vacation with no camera cause of this. 
28758 4 Great service! Great product! 
28759 4 Very Happy with my Drone 
28760 4 Bought it again after losing it in the woods. I used it exclusively outdoors during hiking/climbing/camping. It stood up to the abuse very well for almost 8 months. 
28761 4 These cameras are great! We ordered two, and one of the selfie mirrors... used them at my daughter s wedding reception. Very fun idea, and not that expensive. 
28762 4 great picture quality, love the custom menu options. The only bad thing about this minister is that the battery mount falls off REALLY easily. Like I m about to gaff it on its so bad. But other than that the actual monitor is wonderf. 
28763 2 The batteries are perfectly fine, but the charger takes several hours to recharge just one battery. 
28764 4 Great battery last for long time for mic in sunday service for the church. 
28765 4 Love this strap! I wish I had another camera so I could buy another one! Very innovative 
28766 0 I was shipped a broken product. Gooseneck seems fine but without the clip it is unusable. 
28767 4 It s a great addition to my 5d mark III! Also amazing on the RED and great having the downstream LUTs for video village viewing! 
28768 4 Using camera for business -real estate photos - used just the auto setting but photos were amazing! 
28769 4 So fun to put on my dogs. They are a little confused with it on them, and try and take it off but once they get used to it they forget its on the,. 
28770 4 Love it, solid protection and easy installation! My screen is now protected and my investment is safe! To top it off its made in the USA!! 
28771 4 I got this as a replacement for another company s camera that lost the ability to get on a wireless network. I really like this camera. Easy setup, lots of instructions and support software. The images are incredible and the night vision is perfect. 
28772 4 Loving this system we have had in for a couple weeks or so now and it is pretty simple to set up. Also had to email support from Zmodo with a question and I got an answer back the next day in full details.. Awesome customer service!! 
28773 4 Very nice digital frame... Worth the money! 
28774 3 I wish the strap was a little longer but that s my only issue with it. 
28775 4 This was my 2nd roll of film, (right after the Tri-X 400). I also had this developed right away, and I love the results. I will be using much more of this film as well. 
28776 4 good 
28777 4 Shot one roll and immediately had it developed. This film is wonderful! Can t wait to use the rest. 
28778 4 San disk Mico SD a great media or I can say its a great performance card,greatly recommend to anyone. And the Nikon battery EN-EL 15 a long lasting life I love it 
28779 4 Love using these. Gives a great warmth and life to photos 
28780 4 Awesome 
28781 1 ok 
28782 3 Works really well, I have them in several rooms so I will always have one handy. 
28783 4 Works like a dream! 
28784 4 Awesome bag, great quality and smart design. I have space for everything. Carries tripod under as in photo. Completely waterproof, and it makes everything feel lightweight while carrying. I want to get one in all colors! 
28785 1 Flimsy!!! Poles seemed bent! Parts missing! 
28786 4 Lightweight, nice balance and cool looking. These fit on my Phantom 2, just for all those wondering. 
28787 4 good product 
28788 4 easy to apply, as expected 
28789 1 The LCD Viewfinder keeps fall of the camera. 
28790 4 A must for diy home security rigs and led uv boosters. 
28791 4 These lenses are very fun! I love how it s three different lenses in one! Product came as and when expected! Fit my iPhone 5 just well. Takes really cool pictures, you can get SO much more in the frame! 
28792 4 This is My Second Fuji Camera , I love them for the Dollar ! Great Zoom for a cheaper camera 
28793 4 It was easy as 123 I love 
28794 4 Held charge forever! Lastest all day; photos and videos. 
28795 4 evth ok! 
28796 4 Great product, works well. Good value for the price. This was replacement to my old tripod and I am happy with it. 
28797 4 good 
28798 4 Very versatile. I can charge at home or in my car. 
28799 4 Perfect. 
28800 4 Item was received just as described. 
28801 3 Works but took along time to set up. not the easist set up but once installed has been good. 
28802 1 Will not last very long a year or so at most 
28803 4 Durable and well made, lightweight and lots of room. Easily fits under airplane seats. A must for traveling with your photography equipment. 
28804 4 AWESOME CAMERA!!!!!!!!!!!! GLAD I PURCHASED IT. PICTURES ARE GREAT. 
28805 4 Shipping was good. Battery works fine. 
28806 3 It s just what I needed. 
28807 4 I think this is my second 10 pack of these types of clothes. As a family of forgetful glasses wearers, we go through and lose quite a lot of these. They work wonderfully though! 
28808 3 I know this bag is for NEX, I have a A6000, I thought they were almost the same, well, I was wrong, the inner bag is too small for it...... the bag itself is of good quality. 
28809 2 My biggest complaint with this is the battery compartment; it is awkward to open and close and its hard to keep your batteries and photo chip in plae 
28810 3 Worth the money. 
28811 3 I like the ability of screen flipping between the cameras. The on thing I would suggest is to increase the storage amount. 32 my would be preferred. 
28812 4 Basic as it gets but it gets the job done without hurting the wallet. 
28813 4 works like original battery. 
28814 4 Excelent 
28815 3 Product works as advertised 
28816 4 good product, so far working very well 8/9/2015. 
28817 4 perfect 
28818 0 No instructions, thanks! 
28819 1 Compared this to a brand new battery for the same camera and this lasted about 1/4 of the time of the new battery. You are getting what you pay for here. Only lasted about 2.5 hours with continuous use. Not really worth it. 
28820 4 Great camera for a great price. Super fast shipping. I recommend it! 
28821 0 Bad camera not good at all 
28822 4 Excellent product, and buying experience. I will buy in future 
28823 3 cool looking bag!! Good enough to carry a medium sized DSLR with 18-140mm attached onto it. And a 50mm lens. + the charger and cables. Anything more you will need a larger sized bag. 
28824 4 Pay the extra money for the best. Do Not Waste money on the cheaper products. 
28825 1 It would be nice if they had indications of what they were. Specifically the color and strength. 
28826 0 Bought for my boyfriend for his birthday in April, last month (July) the camera stopped working and won t turn on. Need to contact the company and hope they will work with me and replace it! 
28827 4 Highly recommended for a Canon 7D Mark II with a Canon EF 24-105 mm f/4L IS USM lens! 
28828 3 good product 100% 
28829 4 i love this camera! must buy product if you like traveling 
28830 3 It´s a very good product. I found it confortable to handle it. 
28831 4 ok 
28832 4 Vincent very knowledgeable and very helpful. 
28833 4 This filter works great for enhancing twilight and sundown colors. I saw a video from Bryan Peterson showing how well worked, and I ve tried it a few times with great results. 
28834 4 Reliable and much cheaper than the original. It s a little tight in the battery compartment of the camera, so sometimes we need to give it an extra push with a blade/key to pop it out. Camera operation is definitely as good with this battery as the original. 
28835 4 good deal! 
28836 4 Love my frame! 
28837 4 Great set for a good price. Quick shipping too. 
28838 4 Great camera! Love the quality of the photo. Very crisp and clear for a small camera 
28839 4 Good price. 
28840 4 Great item to allow me to see the camera LCD on a sunny day. 
28841 4 Great device and I bought for very good price 
28842 4 I haven t tried the Panasonic version of this cap, but I will say this one works perfectly. Probably not quite as tight against fine dust as the stock, hand-removable, cap, but very convenient, protective, and considerably cheaper than the Panny. 
28843 3 Great product... 
28844 0 may be Anti-glare. But because the surface is &#34;frosted&#34; it s difficult to see though. 
28845 0 Returned the item.send wrong item 
28846 4 Have only needed one battery replacement, in 2009, for camera purchased in 2005. These batteries work great. 
28847 4 good for price, working great 
28848 3 Very good product, I would recommend it. 
28849 4 Bought these as backups for my Pentax WG-10. They last as long, if not longer, than the OEM battery (which is not that long to begin with). Great price. Worth buying for extra shooting time, since these cameras suck up the juice pretty quickly. 
28850 4 Great bag for the price! 
28851 4 GOOD 
28852 4 I brought this awesome tripod for my sister and she absolutely loves it :-). Thanks! Dear eCost, I have rated the tripod. Here is my name and order number: Name: Dwayne Martin ORDER # 112-3476448-4701025 
28853 4 Go big or go home. If you hike, have some camera gear and other stuff, this pack is for you. It is big, well built, functional and roomy for everything you could imagine including a camera or two. 
28854 3 Just the right fit 
28855 4 ok...ok 
28856 4 A highly capable lens for a bargain price. I ve since switched all my gear over to Fuji, but would recommend this to anyone with a Canon looking for a budget lens. 
28857 4 Great service from the supplier, Amazon Prime gives you peace of mind, the drone is working well. 
28858 4 Works great for my Canon Rebel EOS T3i when the battery needs to charge but I still want to snap pictures. Decent length cord so you are not super tethered to a wall. 
28859 4 ...I used to store a Fuji X-E2 camera, fits correctly. 
28860 4 Absolutely great camera and huge bonus with all the accessories! Definitely recommend anyone looking for a great camera to purchase this bundle set!! 
28861 4 great strap 
28862 4 I am quite pleased with these little clothes. I leave one at each spot I leave one of my pairs of reading glasses (all over the house and my office). great clothes and a good value 
28863 4 Works very well. 
28864 4 Great price, work perfectly 
28865 4 Received product and tried installing it myself, that didn t work. Called D-Link customer service and received excellent assistance from Employee id# AR004671 
28866 3 Take with me all the time 
28867 2 The idia it s good and pricticle, but i being try to charge the remote control and i can t get a 100% charge. 
28868 4 Exactly what was needed. Worked as anticipated immediately and was pleasantly surprised with the additional charging devices. Appreciated the quick delivery. 
28869 4 Excellent. 
28870 3 Nice package but I did not realize the filters were only for the wide lens. No problem. 
28871 4 Fun 
28872 2 I had a couple of parts broken. A Lense was chipped and broken apart and the mini tripod broke but otherwise everything else works just fine. The tripod might be my fault though I don t know. 
28873 4 This is a great bag! It has great features to hold all my camera needs!!!!! 
28874 2 Decent camera, GORGEOUS screen and excellent functionality as far as sharing your photos on social media instantly, but if you re a serious amateur shutterbug, give this camera a pass. NOT good for theater/concert pictures. :/ 
28875 4 Easy to use 
28876 4 As advertised. Great replacement as it is longer than the factory cord. 
28877 4 This works just fine for my 18-5m lens for my Sony nex 3n! I m quite happy with it and see no problems! 
28878 4 fit my go pro hero 2 so I m good 
28879 4 Love love this bag much better then my previous one lots of space. Great ease of handling wish I would have had this one first. 
28880 4 Performed as expected. Reasonable quality for the price. Would recommend to a friend 
28881 4 awesome in every way. don t get a gopro, get the read deal. this blows gopro away. great seller 
28882 4 Makes it easy to align and do long exposures. 
28883 3 As someone over 6 feet tall, the strap is shorter than I like it. Other than that its great. Fit my Canon G16 perfect 
28884 4 perfect 
28885 4 It works properly and charges the battery quickly! 
28886 2 It has a nice level and quick release but the lock doesn t always hold well. 
28887 4 Makes a big difference in comfort from the original one that came with the camera. I can barely feel that it is there. 
28888 4 I can t live without it. Very nice product and good quality. 
28889 4 Changed up fine. Work well. 
28890 2 Most of the package is good. But the tripod is cheaply made. 
28891 4 Great 
28892 4 It s perfect for a nikon j4 or any of the series. 
28893 4 Works great. I have had no issues 
28894 4 Quick delivery, great camera features. Sharp colors, 42x zoom easy to use. 
28895 4 So great, purchased this for a 10th birthday. It was a huge hit ! 
28896 4 Perfect fit to the &#34;T&#34; 
28897 3 I feel like this case protects my camera very well. It stands up and has great padding inside. I like the &#34;hammock&#34; it keeps the camera from sitting on its lens. Only issue I have is that the zipper gets stuck on the corners or the bag with unzipping. 
28898 4 It has been so hard to take decent pictures with my camera phone!!! Finally someone came up with a way to IMPROVE the pics with THIS PRODUCT!! LOVE THIS!! 
28899 4 Great quality for the price! Still trying to get used to the whole connect wireless with WI-FI but overall it s worth it! 
28900 3 works great cheap price 
28901 3 Nice but for my TG-3 with the silicon skin it is a very tight fit. 
28902 3 Very good credit card machine works well! 
28903 4 Works as expected 
28904 4 looks absolutely real!! good quality for price!! 
28905 1 Don t waste your money. It doesn t hardly enlarge the slides at all, and is very cheaply made. 
28906 4 every thing ok 
28907 2 Too visible. I wanted a light that was less conspicuous. 
28908 3 Just what I needed. 
28909 4 Did its job 
28910 4 as expected 
28911 3 Good 
28912 3 Arrived at specified date. I have mo problems at all with it. It does seem a really good beginner drone. Crashed it a lot but with no breakage at all. Just picked up and took off again. 
28913 1 Nice but the bluetooth will not work the video on S6 Edge. 
28914 4 Perfect for aluminum housing for GoPro 4. Nice add-on. 
28915 4 Works well with Night Owl and Swann systems 
28916 4 Great quality Tripod! 
28917 4 No complaints here. Easy to use and makes the most of my poor photography skills. 
28918 1 This lens is not tack sharp. I had this exact lens before and it broke and that lens was much sharper than this one.... not sure what the deal is. 
28919 4 muy bueno 
28920 4 Easy to assemble and great quality. Would recommend for anyone! 
28921 4 I needed a spare battery and this charger was bundled with two, so that s it! 
28922 4 This camera is working perfectly in my home. I LOVE the wide angle lens, the motion detector and the Mic. 
28923 4 Thanks ...!! 
28924 4 I love it, hook it to a tree, railing, small, fits in your pocket. 
28925 3 Good solid case, protects memory cards very well. 
28926 4 I absolutely love this case; it fits my camera perfectly and has room for all of it s cords and accessories! 
28927 4 Best one I ve found so far, doesn t completely block the flash on the camera like the others do. 
28928 4 Takes awesome.pictures! Was really impressed! 
28929 4 Fits well 
28930 4 As advertised. 
28931 4 http://youtu.be/aQB3NtnNnlk 
28932 4 Bon produit et livraison rapide 
28933 1 Ok product. No a bad product but I should have got a more heavy duty product for surfing. 
28934 4 Works great. Perfect for multiple shots over long time periods. Or many quick shots in short time periods. Great for long exposure too. 
28935 4 Easy to install works nicely !! 
28936 4 perfect replacement for the remote. 
28937 4 Perfect charge 
28938 3 I got this mainly because I needed a clear filter to protect lens, and this was red on the outside, thought the matching red caps would be cool as well. Cap is cheap, falls off pretty easily with a little bump, but the filter is still nice. 
28939 2 its a pass trought device only, so make sure you have powered mics other than that is very well built and makes it convenient if you have multiple recording devices and or external mics. 
28940 2 Super heavy 
28941 3 nice product for the price 
28942 4 I installed two of these with Foscam 12 volt cameras. They work! 
28943 2 Arrived on time, but with open box. Filter a little dusty, plastic case obviously opened. No sign of wear on filter, though. 
28944 4 Good one 
28945 3 Very bright and useful only negative is the light has more of a blue tint rather than a natural light color which in turn leaves pictures with a. Blue hue. 
28946 4 Amazing binoculars for a great price! 
28947 0 cheaply made with bad quality.not real gopro stuff 
28948 3 I m a little disappointed that I had to pay to replace the top plate for one that actually works. Especially after I exchanged emails with them about the original being wonky. 
28949 3 Delivery was on time and case holds everything I use. 
28950 4 Small enough to fit in my messenger bag and super light weight. 
28951 4 Great quality picture and range of motion... 
28952 4 This product is far better than i thought it would be, very sturdy. 
28953 0 This does not fit Panasonic DMC-GF2. 
28954 2 I like the concept of this, and it works alright, but it makes it so you have to unscrew it to change the battery on the Nikon D5200. Not sure about other models of camera. 
28955 2 It s ok. Seems solidly built. Started immediately getting some sticky liquid coming out of the joints (viscous coupling?). It s not what I expected though... 
28956 4 this is a great little camera very happy with it 
28957 4 Very Good 
28958 4 An excellent and affordable way to protect your home. We have been using for about a year now. Still love it!!! 
28959 3 Works great. 
28960 4 nice easy use 
28961 4 good little camera. I use it on my boat 
28962 3 it s interesting toy,cheap than gopro,worth the price. 
28963 4 I saw some posts that suggested the battery was generic. Mine definitely said it was a Sony. What more can you say about a battery until it s been used for a while? Guessing it will be like other Sony products - very good. 
28964 4 Excellent 
28965 4 Selfie #YOLO 
28966 4 Love, Love, Love! 
28967 0 I ve been using Canon L lenses and this ND Filter is the worst I ever seen. Not even on manual focus can not get a decent picture. Sometimes cheaper is expensive is you are gonna lose clients taking photos. 
28968 4 working like a champ. way better than original batterys 
28969 4 Work awesome and it s extra long!!! 
28970 4 Works--keep checking for tightness 
28971 4 Product is very good and satisfactory. This seller s items are always welcome. 
28972 4 great battery and one I highly recommend to have on hand if you have an nx camera 
28973 4 Absolutely love my new Canon Soeedlite! It makes such a huge difference in my picture taking. My pictures now look like professional pictures. And it s not as hard to use as I d thought ! 
28974 4 Great case for a mirrorless slr (Sony a5100) Small enough to carry around easily but big enough to carry the camera and some accessories. The built in rain cover is really great. 
28975 4 This is a really nice tripod, the price was lower than I would expect for something this nice. 
28976 1 The degree of play due to the overall design/manufacturing and plastic internals make it hard to adjust and use this for reliably accurate focusing. 
28977 4 its solid...like a good battery 
28978 4 Comes with all the pieces and features you would need in a simple tripod. I love the quick release base. 
28979 4 Very good product so far I din t have any problem 
28980 4 Works perfectly, just what I needed 
28981 0 After light use, the ball head no longer holds. It shifts from one side to another, in a straight line, under light pressure. The no-name one I bought before this one works great. Go figure. 
28982 4 Great battery charger. I am very happy with the item and great sellers to do business with. Will most certainly buy from them again when I need something for my camera. Thank you! 
28983 4 Easily floats the Olympus TG-4 
28984 0 instructions are minimal. I can t seem to use this product because it doesn t seem compatible with my camera. I reached out to cowboy studio to see if they sold a remote connection and they never responded to my inquiry. 
28985 4 I really like this camera the quality of photos and videos are amazing. Very easy to use... 
28986 3 Lots of space. So far so good. Wish there was a water holding spot 
28987 3 works well with my all Canon lens, slow with autofocus, don t work with my Tamron 28-75 2.8 in Autofocus, but all of them work fine in Manual focus. 
28988 3 nice lens. 
28989 4 Exactly what I was expecting. Nice quality, great price. Even nicer that the owner hand signed a thank you in pen. 
28990 4 Good high resolution BNC camera for the money... Great daytime images OK for night does need better infrared for night use to get better images. 
28991 0 I’m truly disappointed with this product. At f5 150mm your picture is ok but as soon as you ZOOM further to 600mm the picture is get Hazy. I am waiting on a replacement...wouldn t recommend this product unless this issue is resolved. 
28992 4 This was perfect for my husband s home base business. It works great for his green screen. He has now picked up more business and making quality videos. I would recommend this to anyone. Great product and price. 
28993 4 Excelent 
28994 4 This is one of the best built monopods I have ever owned. High quality all the way through it and never an issue to work with. Recommend very highly. You cannot beat having this one. It works with you, no matter how you have to use it. I love mine. 
28995 4 Fast delivery, quality product. Thanks ! 
28996 4 Such a good price for a gopro product 
28997 1 This camera did not last very long. I ve got some that where bought direct from Lowes and they are still going strong. This camera only lasted 7 months before it died! Not sure why this one died so quick. 
28998 1 The lock broken in one month. It is very danger for an expensive DSLR. 
28999 3 https://youtu.be/XRIlIN1fJPg 
29000 4 Worked perfect. 
29001 0 China made crap. 
29002 4 Great Price. Great Service. 
29003 4 It was a gift for Grandson 
29004 4 Best color checker out there. 
29005 4 Excellent product and good price with good delivery time. This camera make me happy because i can take good quality pictures 
29006 4 This is a great little camera takes good photos this is the 4th one i bought. if it did not drop them they would last a lot longer for me. use it a lot and have taken thousand of photos with them for work 
29007 2 How is nobody talking about the fact that this camera doesn t have an external mic port!!! 
29008 4 This is a fantastic camera ! I m still learning all the things it can do, but I m well pleased with both the quality of photos and ease of operation. 
29009 4 Just what I expected. Very nice and in perfect condition. 
29010 4 Luv it....so much like my old Canon didn t take me long to learn. 
29011 1 Batteries stopped holding charge a year later. My SONY batteries that I bought with the camera long before that are still holding. Will not buy again. 
29012 4 love it works great 
29013 4 good 
29014 4 Perfect Product. I think it is great. 
29015 4 Amazing lens! My favorite lens! 
29016 4 Super light case that has just enough room for your base camera equipment along with a hydration pack. 
29017 4 thank you 
29018 4 Item received as described, thanks. 
29019 1 It could be better! 
29020 2 Connectors weren t fit right. 
29021 4 Good camera. Night vision is good 
29022 4 Gemtune 577C is a well build quick release plate. When I bought it I was hoping it was going to fit on my Benro S4 tripod head and it did! It fits perfect!!! And it also feets on my Benron K5 tripod head not perfect but it works. 
29023 4 Worked as stated 
29024 4 Convenient.Works as advertised 
29025 4 exact replacement for the charger I misplaced works great, shipped quickly 
29026 4 Perfect for my coolpix 530. Well padded with plenty of room for charger and extra batteries 
29027 4 Using it for DSC-RX100M3. Works fine. 
29028 4 Great transaction and looking forward to my next purchase. Can t believe the price versus high quality! These are my standard lens filters now and go on every lens I get from now on! 
29029 4 Best tripod for a heavy camera and lens! Agility and construction designed well. Based on the fact that the unit is designed to hold heavy components, it s a bit heavy, but I woul buy it again for a second camera. 
29030 4 This is a handy addition to your lens collection. It is a two part lens. The wide angle distance shots do have a curve to them. So be aware that it is not going to be a straight on shot. The macro portion is great! 
29031 4 Practical. Now, have battery to long time =) 
29032 3 Worked well. 
29033 4 NONE 
29034 4 these work great. i continue to buy more 
29035 4 Works, Can t really think of anything I would change. 
29036 4 Really good... More than expected... 
29037 4 I needed a tabletop tripod to use with my spotting scope on my terrace overlooking the East River in Manhattan. This small, sturdy item holds my heavy Kowa with ease. 
29038 4 No complaints, fit my product without any problems 
29039 4 Very nice product--cloths clean my glasses without scratching the lenses. I appreciate the individual plastic sleeves as well. 
29040 4 Very good 
29041 0 I could not activate the camera on my mac. Going to the default IP address by directly connecting to the mac or through the switch did not work. (It just hangs.) The included SADP software only works on Windows. It is going back. 
29042 4 Awesome works great! I love it! 
29043 4 worked great. Exactly what I needed. Expect to use them for a long time. 
29044 4 After figuring out how to sync my YN-560III flashes, the unit works great. The only thing I wish to be included in this unit is that Yongnuo put an option to turn off and on the flashes. 
29045 3 does take a day or 2 in the sun to charge batteries, but if you have enough you can always have some that are fully charged. 
29046 4 Henry very fast service. lots ok knowledge. pleasant to work with.I will recommend this product to all my friends. great camera. 
29047 4 good product. easy to configure 
29048 4 Great camera! 
29049 3 obodys perfect. Came as advertised. on time, just what I expected. 
29050 4 great product worked better than I expected delivery was on time 5 star all the way 
29051 4 great affordable lens. adds a nice touch to composition and does what it needs to do. works great on my sony a7 
29052 4 The security guys asked for $600, Well I bought these and installed them on existing wires as I had replaced my windows. Work like a charm , tested with security company all reeds work 100% 
29053 0 Inner lining separated. Poor stitching. I only used it a few times. But, unfortunate for me the return period has passed. I have only had it since June. 
29054 0 all wrong need np-fp50 
29055 4 Best buy! 
29056 0 The plastic ring around the lenses cracked just from having it in a bag. For a waterproof/ shockproof case this is absolutely unacceptable. Also the seal tends to not seat correctly so you have to really press to get it to seal. 
29057 2 No bag to carry the equipment and the umbrellas seem to be on the very low end of quality. 
29058 4 Meant for the 5D3 feels like a perfect extension of the camera. 
29059 4 excellent! 
29060 0 Same dust/oil spots issue as with D600 -- it s back to Nikon for maintenance again. Auto-focus gives up in low-light. 
29061 4 all ok 
29062 0 Not a real kit; multiple individual items shipped as a &#34;kit&#34;. The only authentic Canon item was the cleaning cloth. 
29063 4 Crystal clear view and a great addition to my cctv pack 
29064 0 Simply a joke and a ripoff. I had to place the leg of my dehumidifier on the battery to keep it in place long enough to charge it. Does not work. 
29065 4 Good value and perfect way to protect your lens investment. 
29066 2 Batteries are good for backup but are by far not as good as originals 
29067 4 thank you i feel more comfortable in my home now as it as done a wonderful job thank you again 
29068 4 Happy with the quality 
29069 4 Batteries charge quickly, and they use the same charging cable as the GoPro which is nice. Battery life is comparable to that of the battery that came with the GoPro; No complaints here!! 
29070 4 Love the ease of use and speed of attaching. I had to buy a second one for a second camera. Would highly recommend 
29071 4 I love it! 
29072 0 the product does not fit my Nikon D3300 camera even though it claim it does. But the return is pretty easy 
29073 4 Very light and comfortable. Seems like good quality for the price. The clasp mechanism is quite secure, though I use the backup strap as well just in case. Best solution I have used, way better than a regular neck strap, or just holding the camera in your hand. Very satisfied. 
29074 4 Excellent 
29075 4 Perfect item. Fits as snug as the one that came when I purchased the unit. Highly recommend this product and seller! 
29076 4 the filter is well made. and works well. 
29077 2 for the price i paid its good 
29078 4 Very good 
29079 3 Fun and cute designs! Order cam fast and in great condition. Would recommend! 
29080 3 I love the shots it captures and the price was right. 
29081 3 Steady, lightweight, and resistant. The ball head is ok for the price. But I would recommend to buy another if your doing panoramic or night photography. 
29082 3 The strap is comfortable. Would appreciate some instruction or suggested attachment ideas. None was included.. Tried to email provider but the suggested address didn t work 
29083 4 Camera fit perfectly in it! 
29084 4 great 
29085 4 A bit of wind can knock it over but it s ideal for the price. My first tripod and I m super happy with what I got. Stands up well and tall, also the grip latches work strong and in all it was a perfect buy. I highly recommend! :) 
29086 3 good camera, good quality videos even is 25 fps max on 1080p, the materials quality is ok 
29087 4 Good size, well padded, extra storage space, good price, and well built. 
29088 2 The band is high quality, but not quite wide enough. It tends to contract into the small space between the front of the lens and the manual focusing ring. 
29089 0 Although the unit seems to work fine (after modification). It did not include the us adaptor as advertised. 
29090 4 Works great!!! 
29091 2 Flimsy when up. Hard to handle without flipping over 
29092 4 Battery and charger are good 
29093 4 Everything in this kit has been very useful and one heck of a price. THe lens is sharp, light weight and everything you need for a walking. 
29094 4 performs well 
29095 4 Just got my X1 CPL and the thinness of the unit is absolutely incredible. I will be testing it out soon and leaving another review. But so far the packaging and the ultra slim construction have impressed me. 
29096 3 The first one I got wasn t a perfect fit for the lens, so they sent me a new one. Works great for my Sigma 18 - 35mm. With my Canon 70 - 210mm, it causes vignetting. 
29097 4 excellent product. 
29098 1 This is way hard to manipulate. 
29099 3 If you don t worry about pets, open the cover and pull the jumper off the board. MUCH better as it picks up movement almost instantly. Other than that, does what it needs to do. 
29100 4 Easy to adjust, easy to wear. 
29101 4 Great. Does exactly what it s supposed to and seems to be of excellent quality! 
29102 4 Used it for my wedding and I was thrilled with the results. 
29103 4 great lens, works as described. 
29104 4 Works as advertised. Have one in the house and one in the backyard. If anyone enters the garage we are immediately notified. 
29105 3 Just what I expected! 
29106 3 Does what is advertised. Very comfortable handle and easy to use mounting equipment 
29107 4 Recently received, It appears a sturdy, well made monopod. Just purchased a ball head for it, 
29108 3 Works great for all 4 of my bodies with a 70-200 (hood reversed), but grip will not fit. 
29109 4 excellent! 
29110 2 You will not be able to fit it in any case. more importantly, the flash will leave a dark mark where this large protrusion interferes with the flash. 
29111 3 works ok for my simple needs. 
29112 0 Non standard PoE and not advertised in the description of the product: it does not come with its own power supply and PoE injector and Samsung tries to sell its own solution with a recorder that costs a lot and has oownly 4 Ethernet imput adding 4 analog inputs 
29113 4 Wow amazing camera, great quality. 
29114 4 Perfect bag for the camera and accessory, great value and quality. 
29115 4 Damn this camera is the s***. Buy one. 
29116 4 The include foam breaks on in 1/2 inch squares allowing a perfect fit. I fit my Nikon D70, 2 standard lens and a 600 zoom along with my GoPro. 
29117 4 Works flawlessly. 
29118 3 Perfect for the small underwater camera, quick delivery, thanks! 
29119 4 excellent batteries 
29120 4 All good made it a great trip 
29121 0 DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT if you plan on using this in the ocean. I got this for bodysurfing and the camera snapped off the base almost immediately. My GoPro belongs to Mother Ocean now. And no....the waves were small - about 1.5 feet. 
29122 4 Good. 
29123 4 Not too much to say. It works perfectly, no sizing issues or difficulty putting on / taking off my camera. 
29124 4 arrived promptly and as promised, thank you 
29125 0 TERRIBLE SERVICE from the Seller. product broke in 2 months and no one will help replace. Not the seller and NOT HP. TERRIBLE al around. 
29126 3 The mount works nicely on most flashlights but ocassionally, the flashlight tends to drop on the floor during the middle of the ride due to the clamp doesn t have a top locking mechanism. It just had a half grip to hold your flashlights. 
29127 4 Great product. Works as described. Great service after the sale. 
29128 4 works well with a speedlite flash 
29129 3 Really good but I don t think it s $1000 good Returned and bought em5 mkii instead. Much happier 
29130 4 Good product. Work as expected. 
29131 4 Works. 
29132 4 Use it all the time and takes great shots 
29133 4 This is the best case for my phantom 
29134 2 Way too bulky. Impossible to go on trip without tripod and without tripod rings. 
29135 2 After very little use, one of the props continues to spins but without the force behind it to lift properly. 
29136 4 Gave it as gift for my Brother in law - He LOVES IT!!!! 
29137 4 Lost the charger for my camera and so happy to find it available on line. It works great and now I can use my camera again. 
29138 4 Works perfect on my d5300. Wanted a flash to get started with and its perfect for learning. Get the remotes too! 
29139 4 My wife LOVES them! They work great - better than we even expected! 
29140 3 for an LED light it takes a lot of batteries but it produces plenty of light. 
29141 0 Arrived after I left for vacation. didn t do any good setting on back porch. 
29142 3 arrived and in all working order good to go the batteries are heavy and you ll need to make a bace for them when charging but thats it 
29143 3 Simple to set up .Works great ! Thank you Price was also great 
29144 4 Very satisfied 
29145 4 Amazing product 
29146 4 It worked out fine. 
29147 0 everything was great but the camera settings won t change kinda of a bummer.. 
29148 4 Fits my Nikon Coolpix P530 perfectly and should fit all similar cameras. It s attractive looking and feels very well made. Very happy with my purchase, especially for the price. 
29149 4 Lightweight and compact. An excellent tripod for hikes and for backup. 
29150 4 Sold material works very well. I am using this to mount my H4N on my DSLR 
29151 4 this was exactly what I needed! 
29152 4 Worked just fine 
29153 4 Perfect match for my Sony camera. 
29154 4 Great little camera. Comes in handy when hooking up my boat trailer too. 
29155 2 Works well with the mobile app and easy to set up using the mobile app. However, I have yet to actually set up the camera because the detailed setup is way too confusing and difficult. The mobile app is good for basic features. 
29156 3 It was a little smaller than we anticipated but otherwise we are very happy with it. 
29157 4 Great Charger! I like the way it lets you know on the screen what is happening during the charge process. 
29158 3 Ordered this a week before a trip to Chicago. Not only did I receive it in time, but it fit and worked perfectly. 
29159 1 No comments 
29160 4 great. 
29161 4 Very happy 
29162 4 I really like this lens. It comes in a soft Pentax pouch. 
29163 4 It is exactly what I ordered and exactly what I needed. No problems! Works perfectly! 
29164 3 Works OK 
29165 0 Horrible!!! Do not buy!!! I used it twice and on the second use it blew a fuse, caused sparks to fly, and fried the cord... & a clients floor... Also the product is made cheaply 
29166 1 It s all all right!! 
29167 4 I am completely satisfied with this camera. I haven t had any problems. 
29168 3 A bit too small, even for my small camcorder ... but well made and designed. 
29169 4 Perfect! 
29170 4 Excellent Product! 
29171 4 They are best battery I ve ever used very good product don t mess with the rest 
29172 0 It never worked. 
29173 4 Arrived before I expected it and was fully charged out of the box, unlike the fuji battery that came with the camera. 
29174 1 The poor quality of this tripod was immediately apparent. Plastic, lightweight, I m not sure how it stands to support anyone s camera, but it was definitely not suitable for mine. 
29175 4 A++++ 
29176 4 It was easy to replace the old DVR with this one. Very straightforward to setup and access via the mobile apps. 
29177 4 Great 
29178 4 Took it with me to Yellowstone. Comfortable enough, and I liked all the different ways to get into the bag. I m a little concerned about the durability of the zippers. Had just the right amount of space for my regular lense, my telephoto and some extra things. 
29179 4 Just what it said it was. 
29180 3 I use it for outdoor work, good 
29181 3 Works like a charm! 
29182 4 Works great. 
29183 4 better than i expected. 
29184 4 This works great. I had to purchase this because I lost the cord for my camera. Now I can upload everything I want. 
29185 4 So easy to use and install. I love that I can check on the house while I am away. The picture is great too! 
29186 4 Great product, easy to use with my iPhone and my iPad. Quick shipping is a bonus!! 
29187 1 Works with my Sony camcorder however DOES NOT work with my Canon Rebel T1i. The Canon does not have the second hole on the bottom to attach it to the tripod base :( 
29188 4 Good package deal! The camera is very good and have been getting great results so far. 
29189 4 Arrived very quick. I love how pictures are capture. 
29190 4 Just the right size for &#34;Grab n Go&#34;. 
29191 2 This tripod is great for run and gun , the only issues are the legs , after the 4th time i used it the lega became loose , maybe the item that i got is bad , other than that run and gun shoulder stablizer was amazing 
29192 4 Excelente. 
29193 4 These are the best deals on security cameras I have came across. They work just as well as the high price cameras. They are weather proof. The IR s work great in total darkness and they have a wide angle lens that covers a larger area. A GREAT DEAL.... 
29194 4 Use this while on vacation. Could have one battery in the camera and the other one in the charger 
29195 4 Excellent product 
29196 4 Love this bad so far. Wish there was a few extra small zippered pockets to keep some smaller accessories separate, but all in all its been a great bag so far. 
29197 4 Perfect, no need to purchase a light stand when I have extra tripods! 
29198 4 Love it. easy to setup. Takes a bit to get used to the navigation. Wife loves it. She can fast forward thru the commercials. Worth every penny. 
29199 4 very lightweight and easy to carry. well done. 
29200 4 okay 
29201 4 Wonderful 
29202 4 A really fine focuser. Built well, heavy duty, very smooth and powerful. A worthy upgrade for a fine telescope. 
29203 3 pretty good camera, had it for 6-7 months and a camera has already gone bad. but pretty good picture. You want know who robbed you, but that you got robbed! 
29204 4 Fantastic little monitor!!! You simply can t beat the quality and features at this price range. Wish it had SDI IN/OUT and HDMI out, but come on... for $139... this IPS monitor is AMAZING!!! I promise you wont regret it! 
29205 4 This Kit is awesome, Worth every penny, It has all that you need to clean the sensitive parts of your camera. I love it. 
29206 2 The video is blurry and unable to capture license plate numbers. I guess you get what you pay for. I will be buying a better one. Sounds are good. The video gets distorted when it gets too hot. 
29207 3 A high quality product. 
29208 3 was a gift. Very well received. 
29209 4 Great Product! 
29210 4 Friend went through. 3 batteries before I went through one with this 
29211 4 A quality piece of equipment. It fits well and is well made. The extra quarter inch added to the bottom of my Sony a7mk2 makes it easier to hold. Combine that with the ease of using the arca swiss style plate and it is a win, win. 
29212 4 Great product, great price 
29213 3 The remote works well but their is no bag that comes with it for protection. 
29214 0 Not an infrared filter - it is a neutral density filter - you can see light through the filter 
29215 3 Great Product 
29216 2 The camera is too &#34;smart&#34; constantly adjusting...I need to read and look up youtube demos. Some of the flash photos have a bit of red in the color. It is heaver than expected and cannot be concealed at concerts...OK (sue me) anyway the dog doesn t mind the flash. 
29217 4 Works great! 
29218 4 Works great! And very economical. 
29219 4 They fit like a charm! 
29220 4 The camera was all that I expected and more. I m very pleased with this product. 
29221 0 junk 
29222 3 I liked the product 
29223 4 I got this for my 9 and 13 year old boys. They love it! Took a few tries to figure out how to fly it, but once they got the hang of it, it is great. Just make sure you go to an open field. 
29224 2 Does not fit the GPH4B perfectly, it s a bit loose. 
29225 4 Loved it, great condition, excellent pics, better than Nikon 200 
29226 4 Very helpful!!! 
29227 2 Great for everyday use, pictures are not as crisp as what I am used to. Good value, if you want great photos, spend more. 
29228 4 Exactly what I wanted perfect and for the price 
29229 4 This charger never gave me any issues, and did just what it was supposed to do: Charge batteries. Even though it s not an &#34;official&#34; Song charger, it still works perfectly. 
29230 0 It was good... until I dove just below the surface of the water... then it leaked 
29231 0 useless 
29232 4 Works great for our Nikon camera! 
29233 4 This lens fits perfectly with my Sony A5100 camera. The pictures are crystal clear. Totally worth it for the price! 
29234 1 not good spend more and get something stronger 
29235 4 Great quality adapter ring screws smoothly no binding onto camera lens and filters.Fast shipping too thanks Goja. 
29236 4 It worked fine 
29237 4 perfect camera if your into the outdoors and are hard on cameras. has never let me down ... even with underwater pictures 
29238 4 Extremely surprised - super great sound quality. Appears is little cheap (pastic wise), but does the job. Used them on my Canon 70D. Picks up great sounds from the back of an auditorium (80-100ft). 
29239 4 Works as advertised. Charged up my batteries for my range finder. 
29240 4 Great replacement. 
29241 4 Its a bit darker, but not enough to offset how helpful this focusing screen really is. Recommended for anyone with fast glass. 
29242 4 Works as advertised 
29243 0 Could not get to work with Mac edited images. Returned 
29244 4 Works on iPhones, cameras & small animals!!! I have even used it to read books. ymmv 
29245 0 just too light to be useful - going to return mine 
29246 1 meh. My older coolpix took nicer pictures. was really hard to figure out how to connect to my phone. returned it. 
29247 1 I m sure this is a fine product, but could never get it to transfer images from my camera. Remote control worked okay, but never transfer. 
29248 4 Well made perfect fit, looks like it belongs with the camera. Saved me from hitting buttons while holding the camera. And made my grip better. Love the material, aircraft quality machining. 
29249 3 Worked as expected. Charged batteries without issue. Only thing I did not l like is that the plug is attached to the unit. Not on a cable. This made it problematic with multiple charging units on wall outlets and strips. Other than that, it is a good purchase. 
29250 4 I go through lots of these it seems 
29251 4 excellent 
29252 3 Everything is good and just wish the recording resolution is bit higher than 480. 
29253 4 Top choice 
29254 1 At random, the system would restart or get stuck for no reason. Other than that, the unit is OK for the price. 
29255 1 Don t be fooled. The color is florescent pink, but its not florescent at all. Impossible to see with full blackout on stage. Unfortunately, this is of no use to me. 
29256 4 Works as advertised, looks good, feels good. glad I could use this on my A580 instead of the big expensive unit Sony says is needed. 
29257 2 I m in the installation task and adjusting the wi fi configuration. 
29258 4 Everything I needed and more for all my small cameras! 
29259 3 Great little case well made overall! I will be buying a larger version very soon 
29260 4 This is the tripod I ve been looking at. 
29261 3 Good hood for the money. The clasping system is very cheesy in my opinion however that is not their fault that canon made that bad call. If it had the flocking is give it 5stars but overall nice for the money! 
29262 4 Really good pictures for a small inexpensive camera. Nice size when traveling and want to take a lot of pictures and not use I-Phone 
29263 3 Good. Just what expected. 
29264 3 easy to set up like all Nest items but I wish you could move the camera remotely. 
29265 4 Amazing and funny toy. Excelent for beginners. 
29266 4 An excellent buy! 
29267 4 I have taken this camera just about everywhere so far. The ocean, mountain biking, on roller coasters, and hiking. I even mounted it on the side of my speed skates for a pretty cool angle. I m very pleased with the outcome, and the cost was great. well worth it. 
29268 4 Thanks. This will be my extra battery. 
29269 2 Good bag, but after owning for awhile the velcro attached to the straps ruined any shirt I had on. Was not noticeable at the time, until it ruined a sweater to the point that I no longer wore it. 
29270 1 Don t work well 
29271 4 Worked just as well as the original, and having the travel charger was great. 
29272 4 Great Item! Would buy again. Did not disappoint. 
29273 3 Was exactly the camera I was looking for as a gift for my granddaughter for her birthday. Great size and weight for a 10 year old. Easy for her to use. 
29274 4 Ordered this to fit my binoculars. Great product, very thick foamy material on the strap. Easily hooks to camera. Feels very secure. You shouldn t be anything but satisfied with this, if it s what you are looking for. 
29275 0 NEEED MY MONEY BACK!!!! thanks 
29276 3 great seller - delivered as promised! 
29277 4 Very impressed with the system. Picture quality was more than expected, set up was fairly easier. Love the fact that can link multiple devices and have 24 hours live access at no charge. Very happy. 
29278 1 Stopped working less than 3 months after purchase. 
29279 3 Yes this is a very good case but my Nikon D750 did not fit in it. But for my D90 it was perfect. If you want it for D750 or D810 please look for something else. 
29280 3 No complaints on the quality. I do wish it had more capacity. There s really not enough room for anything more than the basics. Room for extra batteries, a small charger, and touch screen back pack accessory (for hero 4 black) would be nice. 
29281 3 Great image quality. But i m still using my pen lens for everyday ... size does matter especially in the small mirrorless category. But still it s a great lens. 
29282 4 Works perfectly! 
29283 0 The model I received (which might be a fluke) would not even hold my GoPro after I locked into place. I was really disappointed. 
29284 4 Works great. I used it to look at dates and markings on coins. 
29285 4 Great motor. It s a bit bigger than regular Nema 23 motor, but hole spacing and sizing and everything, fits everything made for Nema 23. It is also much stronger than any Nema 23 motor that you can get and can be wired to be parallel or serial. 
29286 4 kenneth was helpful with setting up an external ip address for us to view our camera from a different network. At times it was hard to understand him. But overall it was a positive experience and we were able to set it up successfully. 
29287 4 Package hot here on time. Love the camera! Great purchase! Thank you. 
29288 4 Took this little Action Camera with us to Puerto Rico and it worked perfect. I bought the extra battery pack and boy was that handy! I recommend this product for the price and its quality. 
29289 4 I bought it for my niece she really loved it. Everything work and fit perfect 
29290 0 not was I was hoping for… 
29291 4 Does a great job. Easy to set up on my phone too! 
29292 4 The adhesive is great. They are still on my lens months later. 
29293 3 Good 
29294 4 Great product 
29295 3 Fools everyone. 
29296 4 Absolutely amazing!! Huge upgrade over my Phantom 2. 
29297 4 Great filter. Now I can shoot video in sunny condition with low aperture and fixed shutter speed. Good deal! 
29298 3 Great bargain easy to use, fairly intuitive, but recommend reading the manual first. 
29299 4 i have an extra battery for gopro now. it works~ 
29300 4 this was just what my little camera needed to help stabilize it to eliminate blurred photos! 
29301 4 We attach this to a model rocket, and the audio and video are awesome. 
29302 4 their perfect 
29303 0 Thought it was a good value, but to good to be true... pictures not consistently clear and didn t double focal sight. 
29304 2 it s ok 
29305 4 Fast delivery. Batteries fit & worked fine in my Nikon S9900 camera. 
29306 3 and it will hold more that just filters; things like lens caps and body caps; I wish it closed more tightly (the Velcro is not wide enough if the case is not really stuffed full). 
29307 4 Wasn t sure what to expect because of price, but it really holds a charge. 
29308 4 Al Was perfect 
29309 4 Met my expectations and was priced right. 
29310 1 to small, good golly how did they make it. 
29311 4 Great selfie stick. very portable and surprisingly sturdy. inexpensive and fashionable. even works on snapchat. 
29312 3 works woderfuly keeps my Nikon D3200 lens clean 
29313 3 good product 
29314 2 Its okay, video looks good in the cam-recorder s screen, But, while seeing in the computer, it is okay, not very good. Picture quality is also pretty ordinary. 
29315 4 Just what we were looking for. Well satisfied! 
29316 4 Great Product! Why pay $60 for the Black Rappid when this is the same thing for a fraction of the cost 
29317 4 The quality of the head strap was great! 
29318 4 works great and feels sturdy while use in my go pro4 camera 
29319 4 Great little camera very sharp pictures easy to use 
29320 4 Great when shooting low to the ground. I use with a baby backdrop stand and an umbrella. Also good for back lighting a backdrop. 
29321 4 Excelent 
29322 3 The price is fair and the item is built in pretty strong material. I use it to mount my digital recorder on top of the DSLR. It works fine. 
29323 4 Camera works. Put it under my garage door opener and now if door is open get constant video. You can turn off too. 
29324 4 Good dependable power I think a bit over priced. 
29325 4 dank 
29326 4 This Brinno camera is outstanding. Many operational choices. Very fast shipping service. Construction is perfect. Well thought out design. 
29327 4 Does what I expect for a camera at this price point. One heel of a zoom range! Sometimes a little slow focusing in busy areas. Pretty crisp and clear too. 
29328 4 might need it 
29329 4 The internal screw terminals allowing an external sensor was a welcome surprise. This should be part of the documentation. I discovered that it worked by testing it. Sensors out in the garage are working well, but needed a repeater. 
29330 4 These are great batteries. Just what I wanted. 
29331 4 Not only protects the hot shoe when not in use, but also provdes a convenient spirit level! 
29332 4 Fast best-of-the-breed telephoto lens. Fantastic pairing with a tc-14e III teleconverter and/or aps-c camera for extra reach. It s big and heavy though but personally I find it manageable. You will get a workout but I m still spry and haven t been hospitalized because of that. 
29333 4 nice 
29334 4 great for my river raft trip 
29335 2 Doesn t do much 
29336 4 We love our GoPro! This thing is amazing! The editing program is very user friendly as well. I recommend buying some kind of steadying mechanism though... the video will look so much more professional if it s not as shaky. 
29337 4 Good quality and really amazing 
29338 3 doesn t go to terribly far but it s lighter then a d celled one 
29339 4 Looks nice and cool. Seems to be sturdy. Would recommend. 
29340 1 Had to discover after delivery that this item will not function without buying the additional Capture Camera Clip for 59.95$. Either sell the entire kit in working condition or don t sell at all 
29341 2 Served the purpose to communicate from the 1st floor to the 2nd floor. No power plug was included so they run on batteries which only last one week. 
29342 4 Awesome. I live one block from Lake Erie in Ohio. I love all the ways to use my go-pro gear-pro camera. I would highly recommend to take on vacations and adventures. 
29343 4 Arrived on time and better than expected. Great product when you don’t have three arms. 
29344 4 Amazing bag- really cant say enough about it. Even let friends borrow it for their Hawaiian honeymoon when they went hiking and they loved it. We used it all of Europe and it was invaluable! My husband felt comfortable wearing it and didnt feel out of place. 
29345 0 I don t know who comes up with these things. They should go work for Mattel. This thing is a joke! 
29346 4 Connects with Microsoft LifeCam Studio 1080p HD Webcam (Q2F-00013) 
29347 2 The telephoto lens works fine but the adapter included in this kit did not fit my G16. The telephoto lens does however fit a real Canon LA-DC58L lens adapter. Since I really bought this for the lens I m satisfied with this purchase. 
29348 4 It was a steal. I shoot music videos with it. I shoot events. Its great i just need extra batteries. 
29349 3 These batteries are added to my growing collection of LP-E6 s for my 5D and SmallHD monitors. They seem to work as good as my OEM batts as well as my Chili and Wasabi Power batteries. Thanks STK 
29350 3 Everything worked as described. The charger was slower than I expected, but it did charge the batteries completely. 
29351 4 The batteries are great and the delivery was earlier than promised or expected. All together a great experience for me with Amazon! 
29352 4 Great product and a good quality for how cheap it is! 
29353 4 Received as expected and works great on my Nikon D5000. Slipped on easily and is very comfortable to use. Great product so and I would definitely order this again! 
29354 4 Great 
29355 4 Worked well give it 5 stars 
29356 0 just because I ordered to a European address didn t mean I wanted the Eruo plug... super inconvenient since I m not even in Europe any more. 
29357 4 good little lamps 
29358 4 Henry was absolutely wonderful! He totally got both of my cameras set up. I didn t have to really do anything, whioch was great being I do not understand a lot about computers. Thank you again Henry! 
29359 4 I have old Nikon and new Panasonic. Went on trip to Alaska. Held batter charger and batteries and san discs. 
29360 4 Perfect 
29361 2 This external viewfinder actually works quite well, but it s prone to breakage since it s dangling off of the camera. Also, for $250, I would recommend just getting the newer Sony A6000 or NEX 6 that both have viewfinders. 
29362 4 favorite black and white film 
29363 0 No quality control at all! :( - Monopod sections don t lock, so camera flops down, rotates with gravity. - One of the lens adapters doesn t thread properly - Remote doesn t work (Even tried a fresh battery) 
29364 4 User friendly, crisp imagery, good battery life. 
29365 4 Great product and fast shipping. Just as described. Thank you! 
29366 1 Works fine for just a hint of extra lighting or if used as backlighting, but makes VERY LITTLE difference. Get something a little stronger. 
29367 0 The batteries do not hold a charge. We charged them for 24 hours before using them and they lasted less than 20 minutes. 
29368 4 I had some difficulty setting up external access from the web, BUT I called the Foscam tech support people and spoke to a gentleman named Edward, and he fixed me up in under 5 minutes. so far so good. great resolution on this camera 
29369 4 Love this case, came as shown in picture. The foam was easy to remove and everything fits snug. 
29370 2 I didn t make note of the three inch size when I purchased them. They are really little! 
29371 4 I love this bag!! perfect size and looks more expensive than what I paid :) 
29372 4 Love it. 
29373 3 good price and product. 
29374 4 My 15 year old loves this camera. The film is very expensive, but it is a very fun camera she uses with her friends. 
29375 4 Great film. Enlarged one of my Ektar negatives to 20x20. Looks fantastic on my wall, professionally framed. Amazing skin tone quality. 
29376 3 Good price. 
29377 4 Don t be fooled because this is a third-party brand; this is an outstanding lens! I used it on my Canon 7D. It s manual, but don t be scared of that. It produces some great images and the 8mm is perfect for crop sensor bodies. 
29378 4 as expected 
29379 4 Great features, Love the ease of use, Got this for a parent that s not super tech savvy and the fact that there s a button for taking pictures and another for recording video is awesome! 
29380 0 Do not buy. Accessories are not as per the details provided. And after sales experience is also bad. 
29381 4 nice adapter now I can use all my Nikon lenses on my Sony vg10 
29382 0 Did NOT fit my camera 
29383 4 very pleased with it all! 
29384 4 Love it! So much for a great price!!! :D So happy!!! 
29385 2 Not built very well and the tolerances are not great, but you get what you paid for. The item works well enough for me and I am satisfied with it. If you are doing hobby level macro photography, this works just fine. 
29386 4 If you don t have one of these you need to. i had some stains on my UV filter that lens cloth wont touch. But after useing this pen they where gone. i gave thisitem fivestars. 
29387 4 Great protection 
29388 4 Excellent lighting solution for my video game streaming set up! 
29389 4 I use this w/ a Tascam to record my mando. Rock solid. Finding well-made stuff in the sea of never-ending (cr*p) makes me Happy. 
29390 4 works great 
29391 4 Works like original battery in my Minolta digital camera 
29392 4 I tested this in a pool and no leaks! I was going to use it on a snorkel tour, but it was canceled. Not sure how well it works in deep water 
29393 4 I really love this lens! 
29394 1 worked great but now after charging the camera says the batteries are dead. Cannot seem to charge them at all 
29395 4 Works as described. Easy and the case is very nice 
29396 4 Just used it on our river trip in Europe and found the settings to be spot on. Threads easily and adjusts smoothly. A good universal fader. 
29397 0 Broken and not working when it arrived. 
29398 4 I like it it is working fine 
29399 4 everything fine. works great. 
29400 4 Works great, and I especially like the car adapter. 
29401 4 The order came in record time and was exactly as advertised. The pole looks very well made, with robust aluminum parts and no cheap plastic. Company seemed to take suggestions about its last iteration of this pole to heart and made the lock screw captive. Very pleased so far! 
29402 4 A cozy but good fit for the Canon SX 50. Room for extra battery and memory cards. 
29403 4 A relief to find avreplacement that works. Go-Pro was no help and don t support older products! 
29404 4 same as OEM if u wanna save a few bucks buy em 
29405 4 Excellent!!! 
29406 3 Nice kit, I ordered it for the hood. It is good enough and stylish, I like it. Filters are fine and I like the case they came in, very handy and useful. Came fast and well packaged. I recommend this item and the seller. 
29407 3 This product is good and reliable! Packaging was good! 
29408 4 Very good enclosure and mount for the Dropcam Pro or NEST camera outside. Just add a Fosmon 10ft Micro USB to USB Flat cable to get under a closed window and you have a perfect installation 
29409 4 We used these for our wedding guests to take selfies at the wedding reception. You have to find a place who will develop these and they have to be sent away for processing. We loved the idea and it was fun! 
29410 4 Outstanding Item and fast shipping. 
29411 2 Worked fine, though I never did figure out how to use the dividers. In the end it met my needs to have a sturdy, safe way to store and transport my family s collection of slides from the 1950 s-1970 s. 
29412 4 was a gift. no complaints so far. 
29413 4 Battery hold a great charge! Good value and well built. 
29414 4 So far so good! Still can t believe the price for this bundle. Looking forward to diving more into this product. 
29415 3 Met every expectation 
29416 4 Seems just fine. No problem, no regrets. Good value. 
29417 0 Package arrived on time as promised. Batteries did not last as long as original GoPro battery. One battery worked once and then would not charge again. Package returned. 
29418 4 great price and works great 
29419 0 The battery gets discharged completely if left in the camera overnight. It recharges fine and it says it s 100%, but doesn t hold the charge at all. I have Canon and STP brands also and they work fine. Total waste of money. 
29420 4 Great size & colors that won t get lost in the bottom of your bag! 
29421 4 very compact and easy to use. 
29422 2 I haven t cracked the code of shooting with a white background yet. Everything turns out gray unless it s essentially over exposed. That said, this is a decent little setup for occasional use. 
29423 1 Easy to setup. Mydlink works great on Android. BUT The picture quality is way below expected. I increased the resolution which helped, but nothing was ever in perfect focus at any distance or lighting. Disappointed 
29424 4 buy it, strap and brackets work well 
29425 0 Its ok but hard to set up 
29426 3 Very well made. I used a youtube video to get it on my camera, which I recommend because if you put the strap on wrong it can come off and your camera can break. This strap is very solid and the pattern is beautiful. 
29427 4 Make sure to pick up the right SD card for best performance 
29428 4 great product thank you 
29429 2 Worked well but after a couple weeks the app is not working so I can view on my phone! I am pretty angry cause I can t get it to work. The cameras work fine and do their job. App sucks. 
29430 4 AMAZING!! There isn t one thing in here that I have a complaint about!!! All of it worked awesomely, is durable, and I have yet to have a problem with any of it. Plan to buy two more for Christmas gifts! 
29431 4 Richard Helped me the reest of the way the cameras aree great and the wireless distance in my case is excelllent aso have utdoors wide excuse me i have treemors 
29432 4 Worked like new. 
29433 4 Works nicely love it! Picked it over the Dropcam. Very happy used it for a few months now. 
29434 4 Everything came as described. The cleaning pen works very well. Plus you can never have too many microfiber cloths 
29435 4 Shipping is fast and quality is good 
29436 4 Very nice filter. Slim profile and machined very well. 
29437 4 Haven t tested it out yet but it is obviously made of high quality materials! 
29438 3 I like it! 
29439 4 used this in the ocean with my go pro and it worked great 
29440 4 Great mount, aggressive price. 
29441 2 Too big for bikes or motorcycles 
29442 4 great! 
29443 4 This was a real surprise. It was a cheap gag stocking stuffer gift for my wife. The gag was on me. We have used our GoPro soo much more with this than ever before. Definitely worth the price and convenience. 
29444 4 as described 
29445 2 Seemed like a good product. I just wanted more of a walkie talkie so I could use inside unite anywhere in my house. Seller was very good about saying they would give me a refund. 
29446 4 Awesome. If I ever need a part I will definitely use them again 
29447 4 Was a gift for my daughter and she really likes it...she used to have the same one that her son drop by mistake inside the water.... it became a perfect gift for her :) 
29448 4 Minimal design, Solid construction. Needed to mount my monitor on to my gimbal. Works great 
29449 2 Our dial was broken but we did not get a chance to return it before the 30-day window. Luckily, the manufacturer fixed it under warranty it just took a while. 
29450 4 These are visitor brand batteries at a Bargain price as far as I can see. Basically getting three for the cost of one fuji battery. Came well Packaged and Fully charged. Superfast service. Highly reccomended 
29451 4 heck ya 
29452 4 This filter is superb, use it all the time when traveling especially 
29453 4 As described, great Product. 
29454 4 It s great to have an external charger and extra batteries. They save a lot of fusle. 
29455 2 Is ok 
29456 4 good quality. 
29457 4 Great case 
29458 4 Just like the original! 
29459 4 This was perfect for a trip I just did to Nicaragua. It helped me to have great pictures and not having to worry about my camera. 
29460 4 This case is the perfect fit for my DJI Phantom3! Plenty of room for all accessories including my ipad! It keeps everything firmly in place and can be adapted to almost any accessory that you might have. The wheels and handle are rugged and store away nicely for travel. 
29461 3 Works well 
29462 4 Henry 
29463 4 Very good quality and fun to use As described, easy to use, bluetooth paired without problems with my samsung. Good quality design, the phone holder grips the phone securely, when unextended its like the size of a normal umbrella, fits into the handbag. Worth every penny, no regrets. 
29464 3 shorter than expected, but I ve heard it s all about how you use it and size isn t necessarily everything... 
29465 1 Cheap plastic lenses, scratch easily... Shade limits photo area & casts shadows at certain angles 
29466 4 Have been using this for a long time now. Works great. Always keep extra batteries available when on vacation. 
29467 0 fake 
29468 4 Good value and easy to set up 
29469 4 I haven t actually testing this under water, but I m happy with it. It s just what the description says it is. 
29470 4 excellent 
29471 3 I finally received my order I believe it was lost in transit. I have used a product and it is like magic 
29472 4 Great product, well built, easy to use, delivered on time. 
29473 4 Nice case 
29474 4 Yep! It works! 
29475 0 The cold shoes are milled wrong and will not accept a flash shoe. 
29476 0 Flimsy and poorly crafted. Strap broke in 3 days. Stitching started to come apart after 6 days. Stay away! 
29477 1 field of view small. recordings will not play back on mac or pc. 
29478 4 VERY cute film!! I m definitely looking forward to using it as it is definitely one of those &#34;here&#34; moments for your fujifilm. I will treasure it and it came very fast and securely packaged! Would order again! 
29479 4 As described. 
29480 3 Nice case - covers lower body and easy to take on and off - looks good. Has little door on side to open for access to USB. One drawback which others have mentioned is to change battery or get access to SD card you must remove the case. 
29481 3 It would have been better if it could charge from USB port. But overall it is pretty good price and quality for two battaries. 
29482 2 This camera is everything I wanted, except the battery doesn t last as long as I would like. This is great for sports pictures, they came out crystal clear, love it. 
29483 4 Very nice strap, I have a full frame DSLR and been wanting a different strap but didn t like the ones that connect to the tripod mount. I saw another photographer with one of these and he liked it and I really like it also. 
29484 4 Fantastic strap that really fits. Shot all day, all week and hand rested well when camera hanging down. Room to use index finger on shutter for once. Great device. 
29485 4 Excelente 
29486 0 Horrible...replaced the bulb and blew within a week I would not buy this!!! 
29487 4 Great for that extra camera body so it is ready to go onto your harness. Nice and snug and good firm click when engaged. I do not worry about them coming undone. 
29488 3 fits loose but it seems ok i ll try it later this week. 
29489 4 Great Product 
29490 4 good value and works like original 
29491 0 Terrible &#34;x&#34; banding at darker settings 
29492 3 works good 
29493 4 Works great Great back up. Holds charge. Similar to original Canon battery. 
29494 4 Excellent product and great customer service!! The seller worked with me to fix some issues which were caused by me. Highly recommended. 
29495 0 I didn t even receive the rilakuma film. It was little twin stars. What the heckie! 
29496 4 I really like these. I ve bought four of them. Their mount is a little bit hokey, but it works, just gotta be careful. can be used on the camera, or hand held. Really very flexible and at a good price. 
29497 4 Awesome! 
29498 2 One stopped holding a charge and inflated in size indicating short circuit, the other worked fine 
29499 0 cheap made 
29500 0 wrong size for my camera 
29501 4 Great size pictures for scrap booking 
29502 4 It is what it is and what it is is fun. 
29503 4 This product arrived as promised. Everything that was described on the site was delivered. Very satisfied overall 
29504 4 it worked perfectly for my camera and got here just in time! 
29505 3 As advertised. 
29506 2 It holds the microphone. Can still hear shocks though. 
29507 3 Good product and received it quickly 
29508 4 Worked perfectly with my camera. 
29509 4 Obviously not top of the line. But it does the job wonderfully! I used this because I will be upgrading my camera soon and the underwater housing for the camera I will be upgrading to would not fit my camera now. So until then I will use this! 
29510 0 I can t say if the video quality is good or not because I can t figure out how to work it. The instructions are terrible and don t make any sense. I would love to be able to find a video showing you how to use this. 
29511 4 Love this camera. Got it for under $100. The red is nice color. Needed wifi camera with 1080p hd video and at least 16mp and this does the job. Bought accessory pack for $20 for case and extra battery. 
29512 4 Great for pics with baby. Cute 
29513 3 Nice camera for a decent price. However, I was eager about the wifi automatic uploading function. It is WAYYYY too complicated - I have never gotten it to work, and I am not tech illiterate. 
29514 1 Not work after two weeks 
29515 4 It is really good 
29516 4 as promoised 
29517 4 wonderful and easy camera to understand and use. 
29518 3 its a case ? 
29519 2 A little bulky 
29520 3 Super handy. I have to always use them with stage weights or sand bags. The base legs do not spread wide enough considering the giant sail that is attached to them. Very light weight, so treat them gingerly. 
29521 0 not much room at all 
29522 4 Works great from the moment it arrived which was on time. 
29523 4 Works Great. Very small and compact, can trigger the camera from the front, or from the back of the IR detector on the camera. Includes 2 buttons - one for focus and shutter release and the other is for a 2 sec delay. Tested range - 3m. 
29524 4 Wonderful camera and you get sooooo much with it for the price! Love it! Perfect for beginner or intermediate photographers! 
29525 4 Not gopro brand but high quality none the the less, great product for the price 
29526 3 Great quality. Not a huge fan of the fish eye but was expected with wide angle lens. 
29527 2 Novelty camera, photos are small and washed out. Don,t waste your money 
29528 3 As an amateur, i found this camera excellent, easy to operate, realistic colors and the build quality is very sturdy as you expect in a product like this. Lens upgrade is a must, the default lens is a bit poor in zoom in my opinion. 
29529 4 Worked great for my application. I m very pleased. Plugs into mic input for DSLR camera. Works for computer and iPad also. 
29530 4 Dove with these about 8 times up to 65 feet and had no fogging problems. I also used a stock gopro 1 and had no leaks, did not use any special dive case. 
29531 4 To expensive 
29532 4 Easy to use, lightweight and compact and came with all the accessories I needed. Shipping was quick! 
29533 1 The eye cup is too big for the Nikon D7100. It s loose and the right side partially blocks the diopter. 
29534 4 Batteries work great in my night vision scope... 
29535 1 Two stars 
29536 4 In the day its a wide clear color view... at night its clear black and white in the pitch dark :) 
29537 4 really surprising 
29538 3 I haven t used it yet, saving it for my cruise in October, but my camera fits nicely into this pouch, and it s triple sealed so you camera won t get wet. 
29539 0 Description is deceiving it states, &#34;higher quality video than what is provided through cable and satellite operators,&#34; which leads you to believe it can work with Cable or satellite TV and it does not. 
29540 4 As described 
29541 4 Works fine 
29542 4 Work like a charm, dusts on sensor of my Nikon D7000 were cleaned, thanks 
29543 4 This should hold my 15 x 56 binoculars steady. 
29544 0 A security camera has no Audio!! Whats the $190 for ?! that was the worse purchase I made within years. On top of that there at least couple of seconds delay. Non of these is acceptable for security camera, garbage! 
29545 4 THIS WORKS LIKE A FRONT LENS CAP SHOULD!!! WHOa !!!1! 
29546 3 Good product for the price; but doesnt feel it s going to be durable... screws seem they will break with use after a few months...let s see... 
29547 4 Excellent 
29548 4 Work just fine. No surprises 
29549 4 nice item, works well on my bag 
29550 3 Good protection at a decent price. 
29551 4 Arrived as described and on time. Thanks 
29552 3 Not the highest quality build that you have ever seen but it does what it needs to do and does it pretty well actually. It has very bright lights and takes double A batteries and it does last a pretty long time. So pretty good purchase made here! 
29553 0 not very sturdy. recommended to spend extra money on the actual stick from GoPro 
29554 4 We love this. It makes the target you are shooting about 100 yards closer. 
29555 3 Excellent 
29556 4 Essential equipment for all photographers can t wait to give it a try. Especially for night and tripod shooting. 
29557 4 I bought this lens for astrophotography. I tried on a clear night in a place away from city lights. The results met my expectations. I recommend this lens to anyone starting in astrophotography with a DSRL. 
29558 4 Just what I needed. Thanks 
29559 4 Great tripod. Grips to anything. Small and compact. Very easy to use. 
29560 4 Awesome camera, setup was a snap! 
29561 4 Awesome video quality, light weight and small in size. Perfect for my 250 quad build. Will do business with again Thanks! 
29562 4 Received these and have charged them up, work fine, thanks much. 
29563 4 Excellent product. Works great. I couldn t get all the features to work at the beginning. Called customers support and spoke with Calvin, everything working perfectly now. He helped me set up the Wireless and the Laptop support. One of the best technical support calls I ever had. 
29564 4 this is a very good flash, it won t disappoint you 
29565 4 Genuine Pentax batteries are the *best!* The shooting time I get with a genuine battery is 10 times longer than a non-Pentax brand, and the battery retains most of its charge after long periods of storage. Highly recommended! 
29566 3 Bought one for me and as a gift for a friend. Trust putting my d-800 on it with a small lens. Great for the price. 
29567 4 Everything works perfectly and for much less cost. The Sony has smaller batteries so you must have one or two on hand when you go out. This really fills the bill. 
29568 2 No what I expected:( 
29569 4 I love them! They were cheap and good products. At first it only shipped one so I contacted the seller and he automatically sent the other one. I got the other one about a week later. :) 
29570 4 Great product and allowed an easy installation of my Security Camera System. 
29571 4 Great value 
29572 4 really nice and conpact 
29573 4 It works great just as stated. Veto is very clear and night pictures are great. 
29574 4 I use this to mate a Nikon D3100 to the Meade ETX 125EC, still requires T-mount that &#34;clicks&#34; into the camera 
29575 4 Excellent 
29576 3 Haven t seen the Canon version, but it can t be much higher quality than this one. 
29577 0 Did not fit our Canon camera as described. Returned for refund. 
29578 4 Works perfectly with no issues. 
29579 4 This case is a snug fit for the Sony Nex-6 with a compact kit lens installed. 
29580 2 has rust which tells me it obviously got wet at some point, though it does work (but for how long) 
29581 4 These cloths have been invaluable for getting my glasses clean. No cleaner necessary, just a few rubs and I can see again clearly. 
29582 2 Best new toy! 
29583 3 Received as expected 
29584 4 Good price, and good quality. 
29585 3 Works as advertised. 
29586 4 Great little flash for the price. 
29587 4 Super cute. Goes well with my camera and I just love it! 
29588 4 works fine. 
29589 4 Everything you need to start capturing the best moments. Love the fact that everything was in perfect condition. I m really enjoying my camera. Even though it s a refurbished, you won t notice it. Because it performance is the same as the new one. 
29590 4 great circular polarizer, fits my 52 mm lens, does a good job in various light settings, makes the colors look so vibrant and nice, particularly the sky when i take landscape shots! 
29591 3 When used with various Lowepro bags this is a great way to distribute weight and reduce the strain on my shoulders (already an issue with two Nikon DSLRs). 
29592 1 price is good but its very cheap made and cant adjust levels on the leg 
29593 4 The quality of this I thought was going to be cheep. I was surprised very sturdy well worth the money! 
29594 4 very light but stable 
29595 4 Definitely love my Polaroid! Film is a little expensive but it is so much fun and in good shape. 
29596 4 Wow. these actually work. I thought for the price they would be half azzed. Can play music, record video, charge thru your PC. If you ride a motorcycle they can be indispensable. 
29597 4 Very very sturdy tripod, I can feel it immediately when I hold it in my hand. All the locks lock in very steady. And the monopod function is very nice too. Generally a very good buy! 
29598 4 Great Camera. Crystal clear and very vivid picture. Love it. 
29599 1 Don t come close to fitting around my 62mm filter. Waste of money. 
29600 2 good to observe Moon only.. not good for even... Mars and Venus. 
29601 4 Works and fast shipping! 
29602 4 The filters work well well for the price. 
29603 4 gave as part of gift bag for someone with new Go Pro and they loved it! 
29604 1 Does fit over case of my I phone but not stable easily dislocated Has typical fish eye distortion as expected 
29605 4 GoPro products are such good quality. This clamp is very strong and I would trust my GoPro clamped to anything with this mount. 
29606 0 One camera came broken and the other two they drain brand new batteries in less than 24 hours 
29607 4 Large enough to fit all my components and to travel with , made very well, I would definitely recommend this for the GoPro 
29608 1 Although it is said to be the h4 3d gimbal, the computer software recognized it as an h3 3d....? Flew great but due to software issues I returned for a full refund. 
29609 4 Works very well on my camera. 
29610 1 This is pretty poorly constructed and doesn t really match the camera at all. I ended up returning it and buying the genuine Panasonic part (which is much better). 
29611 0 I can t get it to work and I threw away the paperwork - so I cannot return it. 
29612 4 Perfect camera for my quad. Simple and easy to install. 
29613 4 works great 
29614 4 Exactly what I needed to complete installation 
29615 4 It works very well. Ken Wolf 
29616 3 This lens came well packaged. So far it has performed well 
29617 4 The bundle work awesome, the stick are very steady and not slippery at all especially I use it to do Tough Mudder..and the boater work wonder since I dropped my go pro couple times in the water during the obstacles. 
29618 4 Great lighting kit. Everything described perfectly. I actually received an extra Sandbag that was not listed but love it since it helps to hold down the hair light. 
29619 4 Just what I needed the battery that comes with the camera does not have near enough power the handle an hour of recording time. I recorded about an hour and a half and the battery was still at about 75 percent charge 
29620 3 Doesn t last as long as a GoPro brand battery but pretty close. But they are totally worth it for the price. Fit perfectly in the gopro 
29621 4 We bought this for our Nikon Waterproof Coolpix camera. It s a perfect fit with enough room for the charger and wire! Great quality and light weight. Definitely worth the price! 
29622 4 Very cool 
29623 4 Love this looks real. keeps people on their toes. 
29624 4 Great cameras, fantastic value 
29625 4 Got the battery, charged it, and it is working perfectly. Fact that I have two batteries makes it better!! 
29626 2 I haven t been able to try it yet but I think it will be awesome. 
29627 4 Awesome camera. Loved it 
29628 4 Inexpensive, a terrific buy! 
29629 2 Camera freezes, we tried it for backing up our 5th wheel but the camera would either be black or freeze up. It was working for just connecting the hitch but now it is freezing up on that too. Very disappointed after reading all the good reviews. 
29630 2 Dark filter works as it should, but polarizing filter is not impressive at all. My honest opinion - isn t worth the money. 
29631 4 Does the job thank you !!!!!!!! 
29632 3 Nice little camera for the money- I may buy more 
29633 4 I like it, it s well made all metal. 
29634 4 Really love using these polaroids in lieu of traditional photos as they add more of an artistic touch to the photos! I would definitely recommend this! 
29635 4 Lobe this camera! If you wanna have fun with photos this is the product for you. 
29636 0 this does not charge from the sun, but will charge from electrical. it will not charge my phone at all. 
29637 4 VERY NICE THANKS GUYS !! 
29638 0 Almost worthless. Customer support is useless. I cannot get my computer to recognize the sd card to view the files. CS was unable to help me and offered no solutions. Save your money on this product. It does not work as advertised. 
29639 4 Works well; strong glue. 
29640 3 Extra batteries are great, charger is super fast! Although that mini tripod can barely hold up any weight.. doesn t stand a chance to hold up my Nikon D5300 (36.5oz ~2.3lbs!) 
29641 4 Good 
29642 4 excellent 
29643 0 It s a piece of junk. Haven t been able to contact the seller to retire this junk so I m stuck with it. 
29644 4 I love that I can bend the tripod to fit where ever I need it to be, used it on a TV, on a shelf. and on my arm! 
29645 4 Love it! perfect for monitoring my house!! 
29646 3 so far good kit, just learning it. will follow up soon. 
29647 4 I bought this originally to hold me over until I could afford the Money Maker from Holdfast. But after 12 weddings in the 2-3 months.....I m not sure I need the Holdfast. Granted it looks awesome....but is it worth $200 more than this??? I m just not sure. 
29648 4 Excellent. Wors as advertised, and the price can not be beat. 
29649 4 Looks real and the motion sensor works up to long distances triggering blinking red light. Great deterrent-very happy! 
29650 4 Works fine as a back-up battery for the camera. 
29651 4 Hold up as well as the name brand cannon ones I have. Great battery! 
29652 4 great battery, I have many older cameras and this works great 
29653 4 I bought this for my Nikon D7100. I love it, light weight and durable. 
29654 0 Hi,the quality is not good. After 3 times the screw was broken, my new flash has been dropped and he has had damage! Don t buy this product! 
29655 4 very nice 
29656 4 So cute!!! Love it! And the delivery speed is very impressive! I ordered at noon and received it the same night! 
29657 0 Did not charge my Sony battery or battery it came with!!!! 
29658 4 Nice Props....no problem at all after 16 flights. Recommend to get prop guards also. 
29659 4 Purchased two of these monitors and was very pleased in the ease of setting up. Now all my family members want one. 
29660 0 Item was broken on arrival. 
29661 4 I really did not know what to expect. But this little light weight tripod is great! I like that the legs extend if needed. 
29662 4 Product arrived on time and was as described. Perfect condition. Thank you ;-) 
29663 2 They re ok.They get the job done but just get a real sensor. 
29664 1 This product looked lioke and advertised to be a two lens case. It is not! only one lens fits into the case when it is closed. 
29665 4 Exceptionally clear and crisp for a cheap lens. Great depth of field with plenty of bokeh. Nice for DSLR video or pictures. 
29666 3 very nice quad, realy easy to fly and take videos, even for beginners after 3-4 flight the battery connector was melted. (both sides) 
29667 4 I love my len 
29668 4 Needed a replacement charger for my video camera and this one really came through for me. 
29669 4 Perfect! 
29670 4 Ie worked perfectly with my old camcorder. 
29671 4 Works just like the GoPro brand name one. Perfectly fine for me. 
29672 3 awesome selfie stick! 
29673 4 This product is more than I could have imagined. 
29674 4 Works as advertized, extreme high qualith cloths 
29675 1 I could only use autofocus on intelligent automatic. 
29676 2 I wanted an IR camcorder to do some amature paranormal investigation. For the price you get what you get but that isn t all bad either. I added the Poloroid 36 led IR light and get up to 30ft of lighted distance. 
29677 0 First time I used it the screen froze. I waited to use it for a vacation and by the time I got back the 30 day return policy had passed. Stuck with a paper weight. 
29678 4 Great product and arrived on time. The charger works well and the batteries hold a charge at least as well as the much more expensive Canon one, possibly better. I am very happy with this product and look forward to buying from this seller again. 
29679 4 This fits my Canon Powershot SX10is perfectly. Price is great. Arrived promptly. 
29680 0 In bought 3 of them and none worked!!!!! 
29681 4 Fantastic item and very economic. I cannot recommend this enought! I am using it with my Sony A7ii and YN-560 III and RF-603. 
29682 4 Kenneth helped me to set up all 3 of our Foscam s so we can have security throughout our home. He was very patient and very helpful. Thank you! 
29683 2 Other reviewers were correct. OK for finding lost change in your sofa. A bit weak for finding anomalies in rifle tubes 
29684 4 Philips wireless Home Monitor is perfect...It is small in fact tiny and can be put in a inconspicuous area. I love it and it does the trick... I can see who is in my home and see if someone is up to &#34;no-good&#34; Money spent well! 
29685 4 Just as described 
29686 4 Works perfectly, just what I needed 
29687 3 It s good, isn t big enough to get the ring in subjects eyes. But it functions very well. 
29688 4 I have been a pro photographer for over a decade, why did it take me so long to buy this lens? It s amazingly sharp and contrasty and great for portraits and candids. 
29689 4 It s Great! Great price and just what I wanted. 
29690 4 Great working camera. Day/Night mode switch over creates a loud click but works like a charm in night mode. 
29691 3 Great addition to your camera set. Definitely a great buy. 
29692 4 Good product 
29693 4 Great case that protects your camera, is compact enough to fit in a purse and easy access. Love it 
29694 4 Works well so far. Good price. 
29695 4 Very cute and worth the price :) 
29696 4 This is an absolutely necessary accessory to the LX100. The clip-on cap is cumbersome and you will end up losing it. This one is always where you need it. Who needs filters anyway? 
29697 3 I love this camera! It s so small I can put it anywhere. I love the color of it. The only thing I didn t like was you can t see what you are recording. Other than that it takes great videos and photos. 
29698 4 Works perfectly on my Sony a5000 camera 
29699 4 Excellent in every sense 
29700 4 Out standing clamp, I hem-hawed over the price for a bit, looked at other options. I already owned a Arcatech ball head, the quality is top of the line, made in the U.S. You get what you pay for in life. 
29701 3 nice item 
29702 4 Definitely a smart purchase 
29703 4 it did meet my expectation. very good picture quality, nice camera color and easy to use. 
29704 4 Yea...this flash is AWESOME! I ve been using a canon 430EX in manual for a while now and I still use this Nissin in manual also (mostly). But the lower profile by itself and easier to use controls just really adds icing on the cake. 
29705 4 This is one outstanding piece of equipment for the price. 
29706 4 great camera 
29707 2 Remote does not have much range to it 
29708 3 Setup is a little confusing, but once you get past that it works great. Access from my smart phone, tablet and PC. 
29709 3 Bought for 17 year old daughter birthday. She loves it. Picture quality is great. 
29710 4 The battery that came with it didn t work. Foto& Tech were quick to reply to my first review. I went to Walmart to get a new battery and it works fine now. 
29711 4 They work great, shipped fast. Would buy again. 
29712 4 poor quelity... fair for the price. 
29713 4 Works great to attach a handle to and is very high quality for the price! 
29714 4 Great quality sound, can hear voices very well even with a great deal of background noise. Highly reccommend these as a very economical yet very effective means of audio monitoring. 
29715 4 Great real like it. 
29716 4 Worked great for me. Did a DSLR video for a big well-known organization using those filters. It worked like a charm. Everybody loved it! 
29717 2 To lobotomize a drone tie a heavy cord or even a light chain to it. The higher it goes the more weight it is dragging. While debugging your new drone, start in the middle of a field, not in a room. 
29718 4 Works great. 
29719 3 cant fault the camera for anything so far. So I should really give 5 stars. However, lack of local storage is a significant drawback. The fifth star lost for lack of local storage possibility. 
29720 0 Total crap. Bolts didn t reach nuts, cheap cheap construction with no QC. Didn t come close to being worth what I paid. Save your money. and get this instead. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WFN4UIS?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2 
29721 4 Works great on my Watson Duo Charger. Now I can charge batteries for my X-T1 and 7D at the same time. 
29722 4 Received as new 
29723 4 Great! Works perfect for my sony camera 
29724 1 Was damage when I buy 
29725 4 Great camera, so great we just ordered another one. Wonderful day image and super clear night image. Our DYI security system works great, especially with our cell phones at work. Great for watching the dogs while we are at work. 
29726 4 Thank you you were very helpful! Couldn t find the batteries anywhere else! 
29727 4 Got it and tried right away. Picture was very good using an older SD card. Just ordered the new model of SD and hoping it will be even better. Glad I bought this instead of paying $300-$400 for something else. 
29728 4 Great. I will buy more 
29729 4 Thank you, A+ 
29730 4 Was impressed with the packaging of this product, as well as my camera! 
29731 4 Gives good battery life and fits perfectly in the Canon SL-1 camera. 
29732 4 works for me 
29733 0 B 
29734 4 Works great and is a must for non-floating cameras. 
29735 2 Looks decent arrived with one broken bulb and another one flickering like crazy. Reaching out to Seller to see what steps they are taking to rectify. I will write more reviews about that and also the product when I use it. 
29736 4 Just what I needed for my wide-angle zoom lens. My only concern might be that the fitment to the 35-70 mm lens could have been a little tighter. Otherwise, it works great. 
29737 4 Love this case. Already have it too full. Looking for next size up. 
29738 4 Slipped these feet into my Watershot case. iPhone 5c now fits. 
29739 4 Great product and received as described A+ 
29740 4 The battery was delivered timely. It charged as advertised and seems to be holding it s charge as expected. I ve only had the battery for a month, so it s still working from it s initial charge. I bought it as a backup for a Canon 70D. 
29741 4 Excelent 
29742 4 great 
29743 4 sooo clear in picture and sound... BUMMED it took me this long to buy it! 
29744 3 it was OK 
29745 3 These cords work well at a fraction of the Canon price points. 
29746 4 For an inexpensive lens this is easy to add on and does enhance the distance. 
29747 4 Easy to use, easy to carry - can hold very large lens and camera and still be very stable - would definitely recommend. 
29748 4 This was a slight upgrade from my old Canon digital which was misplaced. Really great high res photos in any light. I use it for merchandising online. 
29749 4 Absolutely love this camera, the white really sets it apart from the typical DSLRs out there. I highly recommend this for any amateur photographer like myself. 
29750 4 Meet my expectation 
29751 4 Quick, fast, simple, easy 
29752 4 The same as the two cameras I had previously. I lost both to water accidents. I bouth another because I like this model. It is small, inexpensive, has a view finder and takes decent photos and videos. 
29753 0 Junk! Kodak will not support this and the sellers charge a fortune to return plus a restocking fee. My first one completely died after only a year and that was only turning it on during holidays and special occasions. 
29754 4 must have! 
29755 2 I ve been using this with both a FL-600r and an FL-50r. It does it s job but overall I much prefer to just use a small softbox for on-camera. I couldn t recommend this for off-camera use either. 
29756 4 awesome 
29757 4 Great 
29758 4 These cloths work amazingly well and the price is right. 
29759 3 Works good for the price 
29760 4 Fast shipping, smooth transaction, perfect product Thanks! 
29761 4 Product is exactly as expected. They are sitting there as spares - hopefully will never need to use them. 
29762 4 DID WANT WE WANTED IT TO DO 
29763 0 doesn t havew the strength it needs 
29764 4 CAMERA IS GREAT FOR THE PRICE , NO PROBLEMS 
29765 4 This is a great camera. Its worth the cost 
29766 1 The motor is loud and you can hear some of it on videos. I also do not like how short the battery life is. It does make nice videos otherwise but I would recommend getting a spare battery and external mic. 
29767 4 Worked has advertised. Was able to take shots of the starts and lightening. That was the whole reason for the purchase. Excellent price, well worth the money. 
29768 4 Both hoods work very well for my application. I use the retractable hood since I can extent it as needed. I have purchased several products from Gina and have always been happy with my purchses 
29769 4 Worth every penny, AAA+++ 
29770 4 very nice! 
29771 3 Good product, fits perfect on 55/250mm IS STM lens and cheaper than original Canon lens hood. 
29772 3 I like this a lot but I m not a huge fan of how you strap the tripod on. 
29773 3 Finally found a good product for safely cleaning my monitors and flatscreen TVs. The spray and magic fiber cloth work well together and get a good streak free clean. I ve got the small magic fiber cloths for my sunglasses etc. Quality product would definitely recommend to everyone. 
29774 4 Love this bag, great seller 
29775 2 no good. 
29776 4 Bought this device to enable me to download images from my camera to my iPhone for sharing. Absolutely easy to install and intuitive to use. Works as advertised for me. 
29777 0 Supposed to be HD, but it s only low quality SD. Very narrow view lens, can t get much of what you are looking at on the video... maybe somebody s ear, or a blank wall, etc.. 
29778 4 Batteries worked great with my S32. Two batteries got me through a 14-day backpacking trip, hot and cold temperatures. 
29779 4 It works 
29780 1 They do not fit in the camera. I have a canon t5i which it clearly says that they fit, but they do not. They do however fit into my battery grip, but that is not why I bought them! 
29781 4 Super product 
29782 4 as advertised 
29783 2 Hard to remove ! Excellent fit and quality 
29784 4 Love it. It costs less than my previous camera, which I unfortunately dropped and broke, but this seem to have better features. I just hope I don t drop it again. 
29785 4 Excellent! 
29786 4 Purchased 2...easy setup...works great...runs smooth...fast delivery...tech support is there when you need your questions answered...PS LIVE SUPPORT. 
29787 2 I love this polaroid film. However, the light sensitive layer in one pack arrived damaged and each polaroid in that pack was ruined, which is a bummer since each polaroid costs about $3.00 
29788 3 fits on my shotgun and my bow. but feels a little flimsy and may easily break 
29789 3 Fun gimmick, although package arrived damaged on the corner, the lens itself was fine. 
29790 4 Great! Wouldn t use the selfie stick in water... It rusts in a few hours😂 
29791 4 I have been wanting a macro ring light for many years. The Canon light was always too expensive for just casual, non-professional use. This one works great, has adapter rings for almost any lens and is so inexpensive, you deserve to try this. I m very happy. 
29792 0 It doesn t work how can I return 
29793 2 ok for the money, obviously not even close to the manfrotto version, but it will work.. 
29794 4 Awesome little kit. I can t think of a single complaint for these. 
29795 4 Awesome! Vendor great too!!! 
29796 4 Excellent purchase 
29797 3 Nice setup, just the car mount alone normally runs about the cost of the full package. 
29798 4 Use all the time. Do exactly what they are advertised to do. 
29799 3 Very solid but seems to be easily scratched. Perfect use to build a customizable shoulder rig. 
29800 0 Already broken but I didn t keep the information to return it. What a disapointment! 
29801 4 good stuff! 
29802 0 AVOID this case. It leaked while submerged in 30&#34; of water and ruined my SJCAM. No clue what to do from here. There s something to be said for shopping at actual stores. 
29803 3 Very good system 
29804 3 Great little camera for the price!!!!!! I bought this just to keep in my pool bag and it works fine! 
29805 3 Good tough straps that allow very good length adjustment. They were very close to being exactly what I was looking for. The strap adjustments could be tighter to prevent movement. 
29806 4 Work perfect and really come in handy when you have the bluetooth running. For sure need to get if you have a gopro 
29807 4 Excellent package deal. Love this thing. 
29808 1 focus doesn t work and the flash doesn t woik 
29809 1 Lets be honest, you re getting what you paid for. Cheap plastic, cheap quality, looks good for decoration at least. 
29810 4 Fit the case exactly as stated. I didn t have too hard of a time getting the screws in as others have mentioned. Really helped me fit all the smaller camera gear in my case to utilize the most space possible. 
29811 3 Works well really pleased with the GoPro product line. 
29812 4 These are amazing!!! I have one on every lens. I will never lose another lens cap again! The adhesive works perfectly. Best deal ever! 
29813 3 nice item..... 
29814 4 vintage 
29815 4 My son loves this camera! 
29816 4 best strap i ever had. this is way better than those that comes with the camera. this is very comfortable and my camera feels secure. for the price, its no brainer not to get this strap. 
29817 0 Product didn t work. It kept crashing and was very unstable. When I called for support I spoke to someone in India who eventually ask for access to my computer. Although this may not be unusual I declined. Returned the product. Great disappointment. 
29818 1 Okay head, had to grind down the screw heads on the base so that the clamp would fit flush. Also, the clamp is okay, but I have to adjust the tension as the size of the Desmond brackets are different than all my other ones. Wouldn t buy again. 
29819 4 Worked as expected. Car socket adapter made it a plus. 
29820 4 This product really works. Bought a bunch for me, family and friends. 
29821 4 Amazon Basics does it again with amazing quality products at an affordable price. I feel like I stole this thing, it is so much better than it s price tag suggests. I can t imagine what more I would want in a tripod. 
29822 4 As described. Works well. 
29823 0 The majority of the accessories did not fit my GoPro Hero 4 and I inquired about the issue twice will no answers 
29824 3 Works as well as the technology permits. 
29825 4 Works just like the more expensive canon flash. Does what it s made for as long as you know what youre doing. 
29826 0 dont buy from this buyer even by mistake! product looks worse than a chewed up cellphone! 
29827 4 gives you all of the cool items for any adventure 
29828 4 I rarely use it right now, because my mic. Once that is resolved I can use the whole thing. 
29829 4 Great &#34;old school&#34; type cameras and were fun to bring to an event. 
29830 4 This was a gift, but my friend seems pretty happy with it. 
29831 4 It s a great value for a Canon camera, we couldn t be happier. 
29832 4 I love this little thing. It gets great angles from my gopro and very durable. The only thing I don t understand is the Rope thing that came with it. 
29833 0 Great product 
29834 4 Exactly what I wanted! 
29835 0 Does not sync up to our openers. 
29836 0 Horrible product and service. 
29837 0 Had the same problem as others. I plugged in the charger and 30 seconds later I heard a pop. My battery was damaged and the charger no longer worked. 
29838 2 it work !! 
29839 4 This does exactly what it s supposed to. I am able to fit my Sony Nex-3n as well as a Kodak Zi8 and extra batteries, cables, and sd cards. For small cameras and accessories this is a great bag. 
29840 4 Right fit. Lost my original while on vacation. Works great and reasonable priced. 
29841 4 Good 
29842 4 I ll try to remember to add to this next year because these are to replace two competitor s batteries that didn t last but about a year. So far these charged up well and seem to hold their charge well. 
29843 2 Descent. Set up i got what i could afford to learn with. I know its going to be fun either way. 
29844 4 This viewer worked great for slides that are 60 years plus. 
29845 4 Very good 
29846 4 Great housing for the Xiaomi Yi camera. Adds a bit of protection to the unit. Recommend, especially at this price. 
29847 4 Works great, exactly what I needed at the star party. Best to wait until it is on sale. 
29848 4 No problems, charges and lasts just like described. 
29849 2 very grainy picture quality but what do you expect for this price. 
29850 2 Order more, limited life. 
29851 3 Works 
29852 4 It s perfect and wonderful for cutting out glare while looking into the viewfinder. 
29853 4 Works great for spare batteries for the GoPro. And great price compared to GoPro branded batteries. 
29854 0 It did what I wanted with the slides, I have yet to try it on my super 8 film and negatives. 
29855 3 I bought this for my NEX 5 camera to use when we went to Yellowstone this summer. It is a fine lens but it is rather heavy for the camera. However, I am pleased that I had it with me because I got some excellent photos! 
29856 4 Excellent lens hood at a great price fit perfectly! 
29857 4 Exceptional product - in fact, I liked it so much I bought another one! Lightning fast shipping. Great experience and would definitely buy from again!!! 
29858 4 work great best camera at this price. 
29859 1 too small for my use 
29860 4 Arrived quickly and was exactly what I needed. 
29861 0 Horrible back drops. 
29862 3 Super! 
29863 2 The clapper had separated from the board during shipping and i had to glue them back together. Other than that the quality seems good and the price is right. 
29864 4 Received in an appropriate amount of time. Very pleased. 
29865 1 spend the money and buy the real deal 
29866 4 as advertised 
29867 3 Still learning how to use it all. 
29868 3 It fits ok in general but clutching the stop buttons requieres more handling 
29869 4 Best birthday present I ever bought myself. I m still learning this camera and have yet to fiddle with each setting; but the photos I have taken with this camera are polished and look fantastic. I love submitting them to photo societies. 
29870 4 excellent product. it was what I was expecting. 
29871 4 I bought this camera as a birthday gift for my sister. She absolutely loved it! In the digital age where everything is online she was so excited to have instant &#34;old school&#34; pictures. 
29872 4 Awesome product and customer service! 
29873 4 I had one before. I bought one to replace the old one and they work fine. 
29874 4 Got to love Gopro. I recently lost my old Hero 3 Black, and found this one as cheap as it could get. All items arrived as described, it was just as new. Great Photo and Video quality. 
29875 4 Works well! 
29876 3 For the price, this is a decent saddle-bag weight. The material is nylon but appears and feels durable. I placed zip-loc plastic bags inside the compartments of the sand bag then filled those plastic bags with sand. 
29877 4 Great item. Love using it when we are surfing and also when kayaking and hiking 
29878 4 Nice blacked out housing 
29879 0 lenses won t focus - don t waste your money 
29880 4 Fabulous package with so many accessories in it! Couldn t have asked for more! 
29881 4 Very, Very Good Camera. Metal casing is heavy, but I shaved most of weight by making a 1/16 inch thick plywood box for it. Now weighs 0.6 oz. 
29882 4 great 
29883 4 Great 
29884 4 Nice. Easy to set up, sturdy, and is a very gracious size. Also, the carrying case is very helpful. 
29885 3 Like everyone else says, the plastic parts seem weak. But higher priced versions have similar or worse complaints about the same problem. I came back to this one and am pleased that with some care it will stand up to my infrequent needs for a reflector stand. 
29886 4 Case was well made and fit perfectly. Appreciated the extra thought involved in developing the battery change panel. Surprised with the gift wrist added to the package. 
29887 4 I purchased this while I was expecting my first baby so I could capture all her firsts So simple to use, which was great while I had pregnancy brain! Videos are amazingly crisp and clear and look great on our HDTV! 
29888 4 More than I expected. Came with car charger and even plug that we used un Iceland. Great value 
29889 0 Very bad quality products. One mount cracked at 1st time I tried to use. Monopod seems like its gonna break when u extend it. All these cheap chinese stuff. 
29890 1 The strap started ripping I only had it for a month if that. 
29891 4 Cute 
29892 4 Good stuff 
29893 0 This product needed to be set up with their web site and their link didn t work! Still can t use this product! (Not happy!) :-/ 
29894 4 I love these accessories for my go pro hero 4 silver, works perfectly and looks so cool :) 
29895 4 What a tool. this camera rocks. 
29896 3 Very nice lens and affordable to. helps get that clsoer shot 
29897 2 ok for the price. It fulfill my basic needs for a monocular 
29898 4 Lightweight, well built, great optics. Perfect for our Kodiak Brown Bear viewing operation. 
29899 4 helpful 
29900 4 Glad to find original Nikkon products 
29901 4 Excellent!!!! 
29902 4 Arrived as promised and fits the battery. Haven y used it since the battery arrived already charged. 
29903 4 TERRIFIC! 
29904 3 Easy set up, works well, phone app lags a little unless you have 4G but still very useful. would be good if you could adjust the audio notification, motion notification works great. overall a great camera, I will probably get another to monitor another part of the house 
29905 4 Does exactly what it is supposed to! Very well made metal lens hood. I needed a 62mm wide angle for my 28-80mm vintage zoom lens that works great but is prone to flare. This hood solved the flare problem nicely! 
29906 4 Surprised the wife and it works great on vacations. 
29907 2 Love my new Fugi! 
29908 4 Works with d5300 
29909 3 Great polarizer, does not attract dust and I have not had problems with it getting stuck. Inexpensive for the quality, although if you have a budget for a more expensive filter like B+W that would be a better route to go. 
29910 4 I like it. Nice, smooth and eazy to use 
29911 4 Good price, excellent product!!!!! 
29912 0 Would not stay registered on my Veralite, even though I had a repeater less than 20 away. I was unable to get Vera it to recognize it again, even when I brought it inside. Maybe defective - I sent it back. 
29913 4 Works great for mating the pistol grip from the Amazon Basics 70-inch Pistol Grip Tripod to a monopod that s fitted for 1/4-20 thread. 
29914 4 Five star récord. 
29915 0 Never got it to work, and I tried on multiple OS s. Very disappointed 
29916 3 Works as well as OEM at a fraction of the price. 
29917 4 I can t fault the product, it is as described--- but I seldom us it. Too lazy I guess. 
29918 4 it works ! 
29919 4 Fixed the blinking red light of death issue with my FI8920W. I replaced the failed power supply with this one and I was back up and running. 
29920 2 Fits the camera fine, just don t like how it fits in the camera case. Sticks out so far that you have to leave room for it or take it on and off. 
29921 4 Absolutely great value! Super snug & comfy with just the right amount of compartments and dividers. Would purchase and would recommend. 
29922 4 Love using this for my DSLR in the kayak! I holds my camera nicely with extra lenses and some supplies. The shoulder strap is a little awkward, but at least it has it. 
29923 4 I have had no problem with this battery. Works great in my Canon camera. 
29924 3 Excellent ball head, especially at that price! 
29925 4 As expected 
29926 3 Very nice camera for the price. Good clear image, great features, easy to setup. Very easy to use, both from my smartphone and laptop. My wife loves it for watching our pets when not at home. 
29927 4 Perfect and much less expensive than the go pro ones. 
29928 1 Too flexible 
29929 4 Great camera for the price. I m not a great photographer who can use the SLR s. This camera is about as close as you can get to the quality of a SLR, without buying a SLR. Very pleased with the purchase! 
29930 0 The right arm broke at the 4th use... and the camera died within a week... Don t buy this :P 
29931 4 I put 6 rechargeable AAs in it to see how long it would stay on at full power. After 10 hours I finally had to go to bed. I am very impressed with this unit. 
29932 3 This is my third Sony Cyber shot, I feel like it s NOT made well, but it does take AWESOME pictures. 
29933 4 Excellent for low light. Great build quality. 
29934 4 Great camera, great transaction! 
29935 2 Its pretty good but its not very strong, thats why Im gving it 3 stars 
29936 4 Works great 
29937 4 nice 
29938 4 I slip this into large purses, totes and backpacks so that I can take my digital camera with me without having to bring a separate camera bag. It seems to cushion the camera well. 
29939 4 Light weight material makes this tripod easy to carry - it comes with its own carrying bag, too. Surprisingly tall (when the legs are fully extended) and sturdy. I mounted my heavy binoculars on this tripod, and the whole thing was very stable. I would definitely recommend this tripod. 
29940 4 Looks so real 
29941 1 cheaply made 
29942 4 Perfect to use with my older GoPro Hero 2 and the inline microphone. 
29943 4 Excellent product, it works perfectly. 
29944 3 Good product 
29945 4 Great 
29946 4 I love it. it is light and have a lot of adjustment. it perfect for me. thanks 
29947 3 It works ok. Not spectacular, but ok. 
29948 4 I LOVE LOVE LOVE this item!! PLEASE restock so I can buy more!! :) 
29949 4 Beautifully sharp portraits from this lens with gorgeous bokeh. So glad I saved over $1000 by getting this one instead of the 1.4G! 
29950 4 good results 
29951 1 This was a sweet camera until the view screen stopped working after a year of light use. I wouldn t buy another one although the color resolution was excellent for art work. Now a monument to wasted money. 
29952 4 Works as intended..... not easy to operate, but that s how it can be made 
29953 4 Great backup! 
29954 4 Excellent product and oportunity, great price... 
29955 4 great value and excellent product 
29956 4 This was a purchase for myself and I have found it as advertised and a good purchase. The seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with. 
29957 4 Perfect!!! 
29958 4 I upgraded from the FC40. This unit is amazing! 
29959 4 Fantastic camera for the price. I have gotten several hours of HD video out of it. Love the fact that it automatically corrects for orientation of the camera. 
29960 4 Great package. Fits my Panasonic LF1 perfectly. 
29961 0 horrible pictures. piece of junk. 
29962 4 Perfect for sage keeping and easy transport 
29963 3 Nice well made hood. I purchased this hood for my GM5 and it fit the kit lens perfectly. 
29964 2 The sensors are lacking on this product. I am not impressed with the quality and I would have went with a different one if I had it to do again. 
29965 0 The film I received was either expired or defective. Once I went to use it all of the pictures came out like they were not properly developed. 
29966 4 lots of product for the price 
29967 3 great light for video filming the only thing it does not come with the stand 
29968 0 Fell apart. Crap 
29969 4 LOVE IT!!!! 
29970 3 It does a good job with AHD cameras. So far so good. 
29971 4 Works great. 
29972 0 it works only a couple of times than just die 
29973 3 Hope I never have to use it.... but I will.... and I will demand to be served. Thanks. 
29974 4 Great, and very useful. 
29975 4 FRIGING best thing I ever got for my GoPro !!!!!! I use it on 75% of protects it allow me to get so many different angles that mounts sometimes restrict you to have. 
29976 4 Very nice 
29977 3 I haven t used this enough to know if it will hold up, but so far it s a good tripod for the price. 
29978 4 Works great. You can mount the brackets on the wall or use c stands for more portability. Great product and the quality seems good. The rollers and chains are plastic, so naturally I was worried but they are sturdy enoug. No complaints. 
29979 3 Barely got it last night, BUT. First thing I notice is how noisy the shutter is. This surprised me since no one else mentioned this and I thought an electronic, mirror less camera would be silent. Not so! 
29980 2 Ok 
29981 4 This little camera works great! VERY cool, and affordable. Here is a little time lapse I did https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRXNr8AMMrI VERY FUN! 
29982 4 Good product for the price 
29983 4 Nice and clean shots. I use it with all my lenses now and it is producing get shots for it s cost. 
29984 1 The Hood did not fit my Canon t5i, as described. I was able to wedge it on most of the way, but even after that, it did not work as well as the other lens hoods I ve used. 
29985 4 Great product! 
29986 4 Works a treat 
29987 4 Needed this for an older JVC. The cleaner did the job. The heads were so bad that I had to run the cleaner through two times, but I can now view and transfer my old Hi-8 tapes to disc. 
29988 3 It was as described. Have not used it yet. I got it for using under water when in Hawaii. Might go for one that is a bit longer. 
29989 3 solid 
29990 4 These cloths are perfect for display screens, glasses, tablets, kindles etc. I use one mostly on my Kindle, it s great for wiping the finger smudges off the screen. 
29991 4 It is kind of bulky but it provides much more battery time than stock battery that came with videocamera. 
29992 1 Battery drops dead withins three hours. 
29993 4 These are excellent cameras, at a great price. Very well made and a definite improvement in resolution and night vision over the cameras that came with my Swann system. I will continue buying them as replacements and add-ons. 
29994 4 Works great. Good battery life. 
29995 4 Excellent product. 
29996 4 Got camera. Working. Fast shipping 
29997 4 All I Expected! 
29998 4 Great harness. I took this on a 60-mile hike and wore my camera 6 days straight.. couldn t be happier. 
29999 4 Was as advertised 
30000 4 very pleased with the batteries and receiving them so fast 
30001 4 Excellent camera at an excellent price. I graduated from the SX 40 so had a good idea on how to use it. 
30002 4 Great product 
30003 1 Cheap material. Light won t lock in place very flimsy. But the pro is the lights are very bright. 
30004 4 Excellent product. I have several monocular but Polaris Explorer is another level. Very high build quality, very good optics. Highly recommended. 
30005 4 This works very well, does all the single shot and burst and timer and bulb shots, exactly as expected. I have not tested the transmitting range distance but am never very far from the camera in my photography. The instruction manual was surprisingly helpful and well done. 
30006 3 Love this camera, but the history feature take a long time to load. Maybe I need to set it to 780 instead of 1080. 
30007 4 Worked perfectly as expected. 
30008 4 It works as advertised, but I do wish the brick was a little smaller. 
30009 4 Works very well with the Samsung Camcorder. The professional wedding photograph even used it. 
30010 3 I use this quite a bit with Macro photography, works really well.... 
30011 4 excellent product 
30012 0 doesn t work ;( 
30013 4 It was everything I excepted. 
30014 4 Very well made. It can even be used as a regular purse if needed. There s plenty of room to fit other stuff besides the instax mini. Beige looks very classy as well. Overall very pleased with my purchase! 
30015 4 This was purchased for my grandson and he loves it. 
30016 4 Nice prime Canon EF lens for portrait and low light shooting. It is soft when wide open, but sharpens significantly at about f2.8. I don t use it often, but when I do the results are very satisfactory. 
30017 2 Average. Works, but not especially well-made. 
30018 4 Excellent 
30019 4 No issues 
30020 4 These worked well with my D3100. 
30021 4 I love this strap. It feels so good when wearing it because of the velvet that touches the neck. Very good quality and beautiful! Worth the extra money then some others I ve looked at. 
30022 3 Used it the same day I received it. Have no complaints, as described. 
30023 3 i love it so much; but the one thing i can t find is the &#34;flash button&#34; to turn it off. 
30024 2 It served it s purpose for street shots in Europe, but I always wanted to be able to change lenses 
30025 1 Poor quality. Plastic, not durable 
30026 4 Great 
30027 3 Works fine for thé moment. Will really use it only in tow monts. 
30028 4 It is perfect. This I exactly what I wanted. The camera is a gem. 
30029 4 Excellent product, fast shipping. Buy without hesitation. 
30030 3 Awesome camera has alot of extras but moves around when accelerating like on a dirtbike. Just need to figure out how to keep it facing the right way but great picture underwater and regular 
30031 2 Shipping was fast but missing tripod mount. 
30032 4 Great product at a great price. Had all the features of the expensive flashes at a fraction of the price. I love this flash! 
30033 4 good 
30034 4 Amazing sandals very comfortable 
30035 4 Was tight at first and nothing said it won t fit with the lens cap on but now its fine. 
30036 4 Better than previous model with the IR separate, also has audio feed. A challenge of sorts to mount, but doable. Great picture for the price, make sure you get English firmware. check the suppliers.. Some say it is others say from China. Not support available to upgrade if from china 
30037 4 I love it. 
30038 4 Just note that the USB cord is for the battery charger not to transfer data from your camera to your laptop (my mistake). However, the battery works great on my Nikon CoolPix AW110. 
30039 4 Great picture quality day or night. You wont be sorry if you buy this camera. My ZModo system came with 4 and I added 2 more they were that good. 
30040 4 very good 
30041 3 This camera is great. I bought mine for a nursery camera. It does get hot when I to turned on so I try to turn it off when I am not using it. But it is super handy and the remote option is awesome. 
30042 0 cheap! broke on it s first use 
30043 0 I am returning Kodak Easy Share Printer Dock. We were delighted to find one, but it only prints half a picture. I am enclosing sample. Would like to request refund procedures and information to print return label. Thank you 
30044 4 Really nice lens bags. Good protection and smooth sides so they slip into my overloaded bag really easily. Will buy more when ii need them. Better than the Nikon bags that come with their lenses. 
30045 2 No instruction manual, doesn t have very good video at night 
30046 2 I need more direction 
30047 2 makes the motor and iris very noisy and slow. but it works i guess 
30048 4 Love this, if you do not get anything else get this. This really makes you life easier. 
30049 4 Really like, fits alittle small. 
30050 4 My son loves this!!! 
30051 0 Horrible definition 
30052 4 My son is in love!!! He s a sports fanatic and into all things outdoors. These let him and his friends use their GoPros hands free!! And I don t have to worry about it getting smashed up or left behind!!! 
30053 4 The carmers is a replacement they work fine and they were what I want. 
30054 4 Works for Sony action can 
30055 4 excellent! 
30056 4 Loved it, I just needed 2 but is good to have them in a drawer next time you need it. 
30057 4 Yes this is fantastic for our baby monitor. Can put the monitor everywhere now. Very happy. Although it does look very suspect in its packaging which the postman gave me a funny look!!! Lol 
30058 4 Great for smaller items 
30059 4 good for the price! here s my sample clip @1080P https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfuSAyqW8_Y music outdoor sample acoustics https://youtu.be/SdLSbkG1EKE https://youtu.be/lSs5epPOFHQ orchestra/band https://youtu.be/Q37u77MbnaA https://youtu.be/1Q-L_ffqd1c very nice zoom downside battery life 
30060 2 Limited value with sigma 150-500 mm lens since you can t use auto focus and it is hard to manually focus, like shooting craps. Not worth the money. 
30061 4 I ve had this remote a few years. Recently, the cable stopped transmitting, but Promaster s warranty is wonderful. In a very short time, they shipped a brand new cable to me, and the whole remote works just like new again. 
30062 3 The plastic finish could be better but the results match the expectation, great flash for any camera. Good battery consumption. 
30063 4 great what i wanted block out light 
30064 4 Excellent 
30065 4 Great little camera. Nice size for a pocket or a purse. Takes great pictures. Nice zoom range. Also, didn’t buy it with the idea of taking any video but the video capability is a good addition and the video quality is better than I would have thought. 
30066 4 Perfect light with the size , solid build 
30067 4 Great camera!!! Excellent quality, both pictures and video, a lot of cool lenses in this set. Tripod is very light so you can take it anywhere with you. 
30068 1 The case was covered by full of mold... But lens covers were ok. Works good too. 
30069 4 Long and black -- connectors are good 
30070 4 bad I never worked and the seller did not want to be responable, Amazon had to help me and I returned the money 
30071 4 Holds a charge well, does its job. Would buy. Again. 
30072 4 everything came and look like it was in the picture 
30073 4 LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this camera! GREAT picture, LOVE that you aren t replacing batteries all the time, just needs a charge once in awhile, easy to get pics off, and AGAIN GREAT PICTURE! WORTH EVERY PENNY! 
30074 4 Quite a few tapes for the money. 
30075 4 Love just as much the second time purchasing as the first. Awesome product at a crazy awesome price. THANK YOU! 
30076 4 Exactly as described. Great quality paper! 
30077 2 bueno 
30078 4 This is an excellent buy for the money. Very satisfied. 
30079 4 Everything looks just as promised. Used the products last night and they did a swell job! 
30080 3 Unit received fits well on my camera and allows a secure hold and feel. 
30081 4 You really can t beat a good Pelican Case. I mounted these to my 2000 Triumph Tiger 885i and the size is perfect for long rides. For daily riding I m just using my Seahorse tail case. 
30082 4 Best bang for your buck out there. I use these for star gazing at the milky way when in the bahamas and for other scouting uses during the day. they work very well. 
30083 4 Thank you. I got it! My friend said he loves it too! 
30084 4 I love these batteries Work great and they fit my camera Now I can carry all with me incase I need a fresh charged one. Great deal 
30085 4 As expecteted 
30086 3 Pros: Shipment was timely and met specs as advertised. Cons: Not recommended for a heavy DSLR with large lenses. 
30087 4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv0BUK0YocQ Check out the video I did on the unboxing of this item! 
30088 4 Perfect fit, no loose connections to mess with! 
30089 4 Awesome 
30090 4 works as advertised 
30091 4 Works fantastic even in sunlight at F/1.4. I highly suggest it. I am using it on a 1.5x crop-frame DSLR, so I am not sure if any issues full frame cameras would encounter. However, it s a perfect ND filter to start with. 
30092 0 Defective product, poor customer service, one of my biggest mistakes 
30093 4 Fantastic optical quality. 
30094 4 I could write a technical review here. Many have touted the 7DII and its amazing performance. I will say simply......untouchable for a crop frame camera. If you are thinking of adding this to your collection, DO IT! 
30095 1 The ball joint works fine, but for the price this company charges for the weather proof housing and this stupid ball joint, it s ridiculous. For $30 you should get the housing and the ball joint. Instead it s $70 for both. 
30096 4 So far I like them. The rest we will know when he gets back from the deer camp. Anxious to see how videos turn out 
30097 4 Nice lens for the price. 
30098 4 charges my camera up right 
30099 4 Batteries charge up and hold charge well. Great value at a fraction of the cost of Canon batteries. 
30100 3 I have not as yet had the opportunity to use it, hence the 4 stars. Based on design, appearance, and the ratings of others, I am very confident that it will perform as expected. 
30101 4 Great quality great quality and intensity 
30102 4 Nice case, not too small and not too big. Several pockets outside and inside. I have a camera backpack, but I use this case much more often. 
30103 4 Worked perfectly on our older security monitor set up. Much cheaper then trying to buy a bunch of cat monitors. 
30104 4 Works like a charm. Lock the mirror up on your camera for steady shots. Great for selfies of my wife and I as we send pictures to our friends. 
30105 1 I bought this as a replacement for the original canon one that broke. It looks as good as the original however it constantly slides off my T3i. It doesn t lock in place securely and the slightest touch makes it fall right off. 
30106 4 Love the camera, new to DSLR. Easy to use, on auto settings, yet definitely want to explore more manual settings. Highly recommend. Came as advertised. Delivered on on time with prime. 
30107 4 Great looking camera but did not check out the functions since I had returned the camera. 
30108 0 You get what you pay for. The lens is exposed to dust even when not taking pictures. You have to hold this camera very steady or the pictures will be blurred. If this is a 10.1 MP camera, I am disappointed. Bottom line, it is a cheap camera. 
30109 0 Couldn t get the wrinkles out 
30110 4 Excellent products and good pricing. Thanks much. 
30111 2 It s a nice beginner scope but it is very hard to sight in and shakes a lot when trying to adjust. 
30112 4 Super happy with my drone looks great everything is there how it was advertised thanks guys 👍👍 
30113 4 very good 
30114 4 GREAT FOR HIKING,EXTREMELY LIGHTWEIGHT. GREAT VALUE. 
30115 3 Good Product Works as expected 
30116 4 OMG! I don t know how Ive done without this! 
30117 4 So far so good, a lot to learn with this camera to use it to its full potential. 
30118 4 Sharp views. Takes care of lot aberrations. Excellent high end eye piece for an affordable price. 
30119 4 These floats work as advertised. Used them in pool and ocean. Used on my Galaxy S4 phone and Kodak waterproof camera. All went well, items floated and the colors were visible. 
30120 4 Excellent! 
30121 4 Arrived quickly, and just as expected from the order. Thanx! 
30122 0 Unfortunately the tapes do not work. Not sure why but ever time I put the tapes in my equipment it would say the tape was dirty. I had to clean my equipment. Unfortunately I missed the window to send tapes back. 
30123 0 it sucks 
30124 4 exactly as described, I love this lens 
30125 3 Great bundle. Only thing is that the tripod seems a little low quality but that s something that we all have preferences for. Other than that amazing. Very pleased :) 
30126 3 Good camera bag, has a lot of compartments, well padded for protection and durable to use. 
30127 4 Tripod is a little off center like the guy posted in the video but is easily corrected. I use it with a Logitech C615 Webcam works amazing for this. 
30128 4 This is the best. I love how compact it is, it fits in my purse, and holds an extra battery. Definitely worth having. 
30129 4 My experience echoes the experience of others—they re super functional and a good buy. 
30130 3 Only used to scan 35mm. Magnifies small dust. 
30131 4 Lens works great 
30132 4 The order arrived quickly. The batteries and charger have been as good as the battery that came with the camera. Performance as I would expect. 
30133 4 I m a film student in NYC and i want to take my filming to the next level. The stabilizer was a gift from a dear friend of mine. After expressing my need for a stabilizer, my friend did his research and found the perfect combination of affordable and excellency. 
30134 3 good pictures, cycle time a bit long. 
30135 4 For a DSLR such as a Canon Rebel or Panasonic GH4, you need this! Make sure you don t leave it in direct sunlight or you will burn up your LCD like ants in a magnifying glass. 
30136 0 This is horrible only because mine turned out to be a fake. It wouldn t work and looking at pictures of the same camera, they looked nothing alike. :( 
30137 4 OUTSTANDING 
30138 3 Great glasses. Everything we wanted. Thanks 
30139 1 Great product 
30140 4 Fantastic backpack for camera and accessories. I don t go anywhere without it. 
30141 0 first they sent wrong sin card , went and got the new one and it doesn t record!!!!!!!!! The pictures freeze all the time, what a waster of money!!!!! 
30142 4 Great product 
30143 4 Nice to have some extra for all my USB sticks and then some 
30144 4 A complete kit,very usefully Nice and thought camera 
30145 2 I was sceptic all at first but after playing with the cenera and learning to programimg I am very pleased 
30146 4 Excellent quality and very fast shipping thank you. 
30147 4 Great camera for a great price. Still highly recommended 
30148 4 nice product and an excellent seller 
30149 0 Zipper broke just after 30 days warranty period expired. Do not recommend this product. 
30150 4 Film didn t work Did receive refund 
30151 4 I LOVE, VERY GOOD AND EXCELLENT 
30152 0 The notes showed this was good for beginner star gazing. It s really hard to set up and not user friendly at all. 
30153 4 Fits my Tamron 150-600 mm to a T! Quality of materials and fabrication are outstanding. Should last many years of heavy use. This item was supposed to come in September, but it arrived even before the other items I purchased from Amazon on the same order! 
30154 2 Some work, some don t. When they work they are great for a dark cabinet or a gun safe. Unfortunately some arrive DOA. 
30155 4 awesome case. helps you keeping it organized and protected 
30156 4 People had mentioned previously that it doesn t seem to have the same battery life as original camera battiers, but I have not found this to be true. I am very happy with this purchase 
30157 4 Work great , not problems 
30158 3 Hard to find Polaroid type film. 
30159 4 Wonderful camera, color is sharp and clear, the night vision IR is also great. No complaints here great camera at a great price. 
30160 1 I thought it will be good from the reviews, but no. Its not a quality product, maybe some users liked it but your experience may differ. The part that connect the legs is s***ty and sort of broken? One leg gets off really easily. Sorry, not worth the money. 
30161 4 This is truly a great value and is very functional. I received this product as promised, in great condition, and it nicely fits my iPhone. I was a bit skeptical about this product because of its low price, but it is truly a great deal and it works nicely. 
30162 4 This arrived so quickly and is working like a charm. 
30163 0 Unfortunately this is not adjustable and didn t realize it is big, would not work with someone with smaller wrist. Seller is very professional. 
30164 3 Good for what it is. Head mount. I don t really use this but its not bad when wearing a hat so you don t feel the elastic sucking the hard plastic pieces onto your forehead! 
30165 0 Does not improve lens of Fuji HS50EXR, save your money. 
30166 4 I had no problem installing and they work great. 
30167 4 No complaints so far! Affordable and far more compact than the manufacturer s charger. 
30168 4 Just what we wanted. Price was good and arrived as expected. We are very satisfied. 
30169 2 Would have been far better had it come with some directions. Bought it for my wife. Neither of us are tech gurus. Will figure it out but it would have been far easier with direction. 
30170 0 The product description mentioned a non-corrosive set of accesories such as the floating handle grip and the hand-held monopod extendable telescope pole, and both have signs of corrosion starting to show in addition to the floating handle grip getting full of water. 
30171 4 After finally figuring out how the charger works, this is a wonderful thing to have. I think the instructions of use need to be a little more clear to purchasers though. Always glad to have extra batteries for my camera though. 
30172 3 This is a pretty good little remote. Was able to use it from 16 There are no bells and whistles - just shutter button and a 2 second delay option. Your camera must be set on self timer - the 10 second mode. Easy, 
30173 2 Decent product BUT they put the name of the company very large on the side. Masione. Written large on the side. Simple google search tells you they make FAKE cameras. Why not put ANYTHING else? Gonna try and sharpie black it out. 
30174 1 Great product 
30175 3 Great for the price! 
30176 3 Fast shipping. Good performance from products 
30177 1 Great for underwater photos but extremely mediocre for normal use. Flimsy strap provided broke in a week. Takes blurry photos. Disappointed. 
30178 4 Great product! Good price and fast delivery!!! 
30179 0 This stand is HORRIBLE!! Took it out box to set it up and literally pieces began to fly everywhere.The center rod disconnected from the base causing it to be un-level. I could go on for days but overall very inexpensive,bad craftsmanship, It s TRUE You Get What You Pay For 
30180 0 impossible to make it work. 
30181 2 OKay, range is a little to be desired. Batteries that came with it were dead, thought it was DOA until i switched it out. 
30182 4 Very well-built 
30183 4 Good fit for our Sony A6000 with 30mm prime lens :) 
30184 4 Works great and easy to use/install! Great online help guide too. 
30185 4 We are enjoying watching our backyard birds with this great pair of binoculars. Finally had to buy new ones after the one pair we had is over 25 years old. Thank you! 
30186 1 I am very disappointed to say the following; Item came or received not as advertised in the amazon site. Model came was &#34;Incorrect&#34; and different from the picture shown. No item description or Label see on the device itself and looks like fake and not at all a &#34;genuine&#34; product. 
30187 4 The pictures are great, I kove this camera. 
30188 4 Unbelievable. I really appreciate this product. High quality! Amazing photo, video and time-lapse! 
30189 4 perfect, just what I wanted to protect my camera when out and about. 
30190 4 Great for my purposes 
30191 0 Equipment looks great, to bad it s worthless. 
30192 4 It seems to be doing what I bought it for, protecting the lens from dust and fingerprints and etc. 
30193 2 runs out quick.... 
30194 4 For my first backdrop stand it was a great buy. Sturdy and come with a carrying case. Great value! 
30195 4 These batteries are great for on the go and work very well to keep a long charge! 
30196 2 Given as a gift. 
30197 4 Great product 
30198 4 The camera is great and the service is quick. Walter helped me get I back on the app. 
30199 2 small bag which does the job for a starter 
30200 4 This light modifier produces lovely directed light. I wish it came with a carrying case. 
30201 3 The life of these batteries is about 40% of the battery that came with my GoPro. That s an estimate. My GoPro battery lasts about 3 - 4 hours at 1080p / 60 fps. These batteries last about 1.5 - 2 hours each at the same settings. 
30202 4 The charger worked and the delivery was very good. Happy with purchase. 
30203 4 Roy 2nd call did the job .as far as camera ,for the money ,excellent and great picture and wireless ,perfect 
30204 3 Works great 
30205 4 Package came waaayyyyyy before expectancy date (like 2 weeks early )it was amazing product is gorgeous and fitsss nicceeee 
30206 4 Great !! 
30207 4 I purchased this while on vacation so I could get all of my cameras and lenses back home safe. this is an amazing case. I love it 
30208 4 Perfect day bag for quick trips. I don t like to carry all of my accessories so this works perfectly. Can fit my DSLR body, two lenses inside easily. Outside pocket is great for extra batteries and memory cards. I use the side pockets for my cell phone and money. 
30209 2 Works ok. The only thing I would recommend to the designers is away to know that a camera is truly straight. Maybe put some markers to know a camera is leveled. 
30210 4 Great batteries. They save you money as the C123 s are very expensive. I ended up buying an 18650 for 1 of the lights and it worked amazing but it was to big to fit into the other. These will do. 
30211 3 Everything was as advertised. You could spend more and only get the charger. Here you extra batteries as well. 
30212 3 ok 
30213 4 As advertised. Quicker than expected. 
30214 0 The opteka micro lens does not even fit. They really try to trick into saying this is made for the AX100 this company needs to get its act together. 
30215 4 Worked for my 77mm Variable ND Filter which had 77mm threads and 82mm opening on front. Good quality. 
30216 4 Very good for an everyday use of online selling. Be aware that this is only for small items and if you have bigger items to photo-shoot you need to get something bigger. price is excellent. 
30217 4 love the borders! perfect for a day at disneyland. 
30218 4 Awesome 
30219 4 Thank u 
30220 3 Great Cam for the price! 
30221 4 I love these camera s, and with the Hero 3+, every change has been a solid improvement. 
30222 4 got these for hero 4 silver. no problems at all, and the dual charger is super handy! also charges the GoPro battery with no problem 
30223 4 I have already used this product numerous times. Including on my boat when my camera battery died! I LOVE IT! 
30224 4 works great...and still working great 
30225 2 Everything works pretty well. It get what you paid for. But I did not recieve the spare battery in the package. It is included with the picture but I didnt get on in my order. Other than that its not half bad. 
30226 4 The sound from this little guy is great. Love the bass that comes from it. 
30227 2 The fix for the battery is a bit loose but, it does the trick for the price. 
30228 0 Without screw lock on bottom of case, camera will fall out of case.....when opening to shoot? WHY??. 
30229 3 functions well and looks good. L E D has discontinued to function after a month or so. Will not operate without a battery. 
30230 4 The best deal in a TTL flash. Complete kit with off camera remote. Everything except batteries included. TTL Zoom flash pairs perfectly with Nikon 5200. If you need a flash but unwilling to spend $300-400 for Nikon branded one, this is what you want. 
30231 0 Can t fit extended battery. 
30232 4 I ordered these especially to make colored sleeves to put over my Windows Phone in my purse (so I could find it!). I ordered Aug. 15 and received the cloths on Aug.17. 
30233 4 Good Batteries for the prices. 
30234 4 Fit easily and looks good. 
30235 4 I just received these items yesterday 8/10/2015 and everything seems to be just fine. 
30236 4 good 
30237 4 Great underwater shots! 
30238 0 Ordered in March, stopped working on June...ineligible for return. 
30239 4 Cheap and effective. Arrived very promptly 
30240 3 It s strong and smooth. The only minor drawback is it could use a locking mechanism on the horizontal axis. But the friction knob is very adequate when transporting in the wild. 
30241 3 Excellent product 
30242 4 Very Good for Great Price 
30243 4 These work just as good, if not better than the GoPro version. No complaints and you get more for your money. 
30244 4 I was nervous it wouldn t fit/work. It worked great for my Fuji Fine Pix F850EXR. Very happy. 
30245 4 Works like a charm. 
30246 4 love, have a lot to learn best next to top of line cameras lens is built in and a viewfinder. 
30247 1 I believe it was a combo of 45 plus developing time and problems with it not feeding the 1st or last pic right which left me 6 pics.....bummed was stoked on the idea. 
30248 4 Great price with great image 
30249 4 Very comfortable, and very secure. 
30250 4 perfect for a beginner 
30251 4 Work great! 
30252 4 Just what I wanted. 
30253 2 Resolution, not that good 
30254 2 works but very flimsy, do not expect to much out of this thing. 
30255 4 Clear videos....takes a learning curve to have it up and running, but I got through it. Love the &#34;quick&#34; settings so the camera can move faster. Linked it up to my cell so I can see whats going on from my workplace. Either in the home or away...very nice camera... 
30256 4 Simple case that offers protection but not a lot of bulk. I like the zipper pocket -- I can keep extra memory cards there or just a little cash. 
30257 3 Good product. 
30258 4 Just what I needed. Couldn t find the right battery for my camera. Now I m taking pics without having to purchase a new camera. Thanks. 
30259 1 Not for outdoors. I hate it 
30260 0 This was the same number battery, but did not fit my Kodak camera. 
30261 3 Great fun recording waves and surf. Can not wait for the surf to quiet down a little to get some snorkeling done. 
30262 4 Works to get better looking video using my DSLR Nikon camera 
30263 4 Quick shipping, just what I needed and works well. 
30264 4 asdf 
30265 3 The particulars of this plan seem to suit my needs if I should need to utilize this protection plan. 
30266 0 water leak about 25ft 
30267 4 Very good. 
30268 4 Great quality from DJI as expected. I have purchased knockoffs at a cheaper price and they have all failed. This is by far the better value. 
30269 4 works for me great product and real peace of mind keeping my go pro safe. Thanks!! 
30270 3 Very soft and nice just like the vonoto. This one came in the write color. 
30271 4 Very good and cheap batteries, I am satisfied ! 
30272 4 Works great and has a good picture. Pretty easy to set up. 
30273 4 I love this bag, it is now my primary 
30274 4 Exact fit for my Canon 70D. Easy to apply. Touch screen function still works perfectly. Highly recommended. 
30275 4 A gift for my father. He loves them. 
30276 0 The device didn t work 
30277 4 Perfect for my needs. Very versatile, quite bright. I have three now. I have some vision issues and this is a lifesaver when I m doing fine work 
30278 4 Fine purchase 
30279 0 The GoPro stays on perfectly. No issues with that. But if the pole is extended it rotates. To keep it in place I have to have it retracted and hold the silver part of the pole so that the GoPro stays upright. Not satisfied with this product. 
30280 4 Excelente. 
30281 4 excellent 
30282 4 Excellent and they actually float too 
30283 3 My daughter loves it. 
30284 4 So glad I bought this replacement. Works great and charges well. 
30285 4 Great kit, and great value. 
30286 4 i really like it,,its a little motion senitive but all in all a good little camera 
30287 4 Did great. Went on vacation Rained a couple of days and did not worry it got wet. 
30288 4 Working great and the longer length is nice too. 
30289 4 Can t beat it for the price! :) Fully Manual, but works! 
30290 1 the quality is noticeably worse with these papers zzz quite disappointed. the ones that come with the printer are way better. now i m going to have 100 crappy pictures ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ never again 
30291 4 Well done, I Like 
30292 4 very simple plug and play gimbal. very good value. great if you are to scared to but those metal 3D gimbals for twice the money 
30293 3 Good product, but buy the 6-pack and get the free case from the PolarPro site - better deal and more complete. 
30294 4 works well. the alarm will continue to sound until you turn it of. The GE model will stop alarming when the trigger is released. 
30295 4 Excellent case is much bigger than expected. Holds my extra batteries, suction mount, chest and head mounts, and tons of fixture adjustments. Very well padded, perfectly fits standard locks, and the pressure release valve is very useful when travelling across country with altitude changes frequently. Worth every penny. 
30296 3 Very good camera , the only flaw is the instruction book only in Japanese. 
30297 4 I recommend, fast delivery. very good 
30298 0 Reverted back to my old Pogoplug because this wasn t working right. 
30299 2 works ok, sometimes it goes off when no one comes in 
30300 4 Really good cleaning cloths!! Highly recommend for anything with a screen 
30301 4 Great! 
30302 4 Super easy to use ! 
30303 4 awesome flash for videos 
30304 4 got this as a gift... but hope to get one for myself soon. 
30305 3 Works well, I took it snorkeling with my underwater camcorder. The extending and retracting method is a bit difficult and needs getting used to. 
30306 4 Perfect for rooms. 
30307 0 Does not work. Trim falling off. 
30308 4 Shipped quickly and is as advertised. 
30309 3 Works well with my lamp stand. cord would be a little longer. 
30310 0 Cheaply made in China. Instructions would have been a big help also! Don t buy it! 
30311 0 Junk. Did not work - at all. 
30312 0 Item does not work according to the manual. very poorly made. 
30313 4 The cables were perfect. Just what we needed. They are a nice quality. 
30314 2 Very good! 
30315 4 Work just like the battery that came with the camera. So convenient and charge quickly! 
30316 4 Original cap for my Lumix camera. Fits perfectly. 
30317 4 very good 
30318 4 Very well made Product. 
30319 4 This set is awesome.It is very durable and easy to use, It keeps your go pro in place so you dont have to worry about it getting damaged or falling while in use.I recommend this to everyone to use! 
30320 4 pretty impressive little gizmo. Everyone in my office wants one. The phone app is also great. All I do is touch the app on my phone and I can see my living room. 
30321 4 Mobile phone tripod attachment. Works perfectly well. 
30322 3 It s not professional quality, but for $24.99 you can t really complain. 
30323 4 Works great! 
30324 3 It was what I wanted at an affordable price 
30325 4 perfect 
30326 4 Fast ship! Very well-designed bag at a reasonable price. 
30327 4 Nice cameras easy to install excellent picture quality 
30328 4 Just what we needed 
30329 2 It worked for me for a year and then my cmaera would not recognize it any more. Next time I will purchase a Canon grip. 
30330 2 Definition of image is not very good even with adjustments allowed by the program. But what could you expect for the price. Would be nice to add a mirror to be able to see at angle i tight space. Probably could pay twice as much and get a better image. 
30331 0 One of the Camera s don t work and the hard drive doesn t record. One of the holder for the camera is strip. They haven t responded back to my request for a new camera and hard drive.. 
30332 4 I couldn t find a better price, and their quick shipping to Hawaii is second to none. Product is as described. The precut slots are perfect for my GoPro and accessories. My only regret is not getting the large sized since I ended up buying more accessories. 
30333 4 excellent product and fast delivery 
30334 4 surprised with how solidly its built. provides extra utility as a baton, if needed. 
30335 4 Works well 
30336 4 Works great with my Honeywell vista 20p panel. I picked it specifically because CDMA coverage in my area outperforms GSM by far. Telguard interactive is also a great feature. Very happy with the product. Long time Telular customer back to SXT1 
30337 2 It s ok 
30338 4 Works great! 
30339 3 WORKS WELL. 
30340 3 Good 
30341 3 nice product i ever used. just go for it 
30342 4 Love it 
30343 0 This did not work as expected. 
30344 4 Works wonderful for all of my lens. I like the hook on them for security and also so I can hook them onto whatever bag or case I am using for easy access! 
30345 4 Great lens, check out some photos I took with it on my instagram @jonathinadams 
30346 4 Does the job it was made for. Thank You 
30347 4 Worked perfectly! 
30348 0 POJ! Make pics blurry. They make magnifiy 2x but its not worth it when every pics comes out blurry. Returning. 
30349 2 Camera is good but battery life is low. It drain out fast. Need more power full battery. 
30350 4 good 
30351 2 The mechanism seems to be doing fine, but the programming of the system is terrible. Need to make some major improvements. 
30352 4 This kit comes with everything you would need. The quality is excellent 
30353 4 Great flash best ever 
30354 4 Thank you ! 
30355 3 Great camera, underwater pics turned out awesome! 
30356 4 Great 
30357 4 Excellent product! 
30358 3 Not much to say here, good quality cloths for a pretty good price. Gave me enough to keep one near each of my primary devices, the little phone wipe is neat but overall just kind of gimmicky. I feel like it will lose it s sticky properties in short order. 
30359 0 This product worked for 1 week, then it wouldn t recharge. My opinion spend a little more money and buy a more expensive one. 
30360 4 Everything went smooth. 
30361 0 It s not what I expected you need to remove the whole front cover in order to take pictures 
30362 2 Poor / little instructions on use i cant figure out how to cycle through all cameras on full screen not switch from 1 to a 3 view. 
30363 3 Still learning to use, good starter kit in my opinion. 
30364 3 I like it a lot... My first ring light and so far is good... 
30365 4 Good product, bit of a fiddle to apply, but then they all are. Customer support from them is excellent. 
30366 4 Cheap, easy to use, small enough to fit in just about any pocket of my pack. Lasts as long as the GoPro branded stuff. 
30367 3 I bought it as a portable container for my GoPro and various accessories. It works, but despite the flexible sections inside it really isn t ideal for it. I do like it, and it seems to be holding up well. 
30368 4 Better than I had hoped for an aftermarket product. Fits perfectly and snugly to boot. Well worth it. 
30369 4 Great Item! Would buy again. Did not disappoint. 
30370 2 The acessories not very goos, the camera is amazing, but the quality of the acessories not the same. 
30371 2 Loved the look and feel. Sadly it fell off after some time never to be seen again. 
30372 4 Works like a charm! ✔️ stabilization is quick and easy! :) 
30373 3 Works well as advertised in my Sony A6000. 
30374 4 Good 
30375 0 DVR is junk and not usable from web even internally. Received and returned to replace 3 broken cams. Should have sent the whole system back but I had already ran the cables throughout walls. I m now replacing it with blue iris and WiFi cameras 
30376 4 Awesome juice when you need it. 
30377 2 It works great thanks 
30378 4 wish it came with an owners manual like my other one. 
30379 4 First lens I got for a beginner camera. Works great. 
30380 4 this thing is better than a gopro picture good but the video is awsome 
30381 4 Great thanks!! 
30382 4 Came very quickly and works great! They don t make this camera anymore, and mine got a crack on the battery casing, so I was happy to find a good used one on amazon. VERY SATISFIED! 
30383 4 Very Good 
30384 3 Great pictures 
30385 3 Exactly as advertised. Good camera, accessories were not premium quality, but I knew that going in. This was a great value for me. I m using it to take vacation and family pictures and hobby photos. 
30386 4 It is good battery 
30387 4 Came in as expected! 
30388 0 i need help with this how do i use this i cant find out[[ASIN:B00M7RROU8 8GB Mini HD Glasses Spy Hidden Camera Sunglasses Eyewear DVR Video Recorder Cam]] 
30389 4 It arrived on time. Everything was as advertized. 
30390 4 Perfect for my Sony RX1003. Snug fit, looks good. Priced right. 
30391 4 Fits perfectly and gives piece of mind. Like some other reviewers I had the issue fitting the installed guard in my hardshell backpack, but after a little careful cutting of the pack s foam w/ a sharp knife, the guard slides right in, secured w/ the zip ties. 
30392 4 My Swann video security system came with four cameras with the DVR able to support eight. I purchased two more cameras and needed the additional power supply. This unit powered up the new cameras just fine and has been working fine for several months so far... 
30393 4 Excellent for holding multiple flash units 
30394 4 This lens hood fits perfectly on my 75mm f1.8 lens. I have not seen the Olympus equivalent, but this lens hood is well built and works as expected. 
30395 0 Dead right out of the box. My dogs were roaming the neighborhood until I could find a decent replacement. 
30396 3 as described 
30397 4 Nice backdrop. 
30398 4 Great 
30399 4 This strap makes carrying a camera very simple without pulling on the neck or being uncomfortable. I would recommend to anyone. 
30400 1 Good build quality, but did not fit my Canon EF 24-70mm 4.0 lens, despite the listed technical specifications indicating it would. 
30401 3 guuud 
30402 4 Good quality 
30403 4 I wish that I had this from the start. Now I have my 18-55 and 55-300 that are useless to me. This does it all and yes it is very well constructed. Nice Job. 
30404 4 Great Product, it is a better back pack than the actual DJI back pack. 
30405 0 Did not work! 
30406 0 Does not connect to wifi no matter how hard you try, had to return product 
30407 0 This item arrived promptly. Unfortunately the white reflector was marked with purple throughout. Whereas, I have done a lot of positive business with Fotodiox in the past, I am willing to upgrade my opinion of this product once it has been replaced. 
30408 4 Every bit as cute as shown. 
30409 4 Extremely helpful!
