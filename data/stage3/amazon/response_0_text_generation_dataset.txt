[BEGIN] These are fakes! I could barely control my Phantom with these on and nearly crashed into nearby objects. DO NOT BUY THESE!  [END]
[BEGIN] No support. Doesn t do ftp doesn t work properly with motion detection, doesn t seem to do anything well.  [END]
[BEGIN] This thing is a pile of junk, cannot even figure out how to make it take pictures! Once you turn it on you cant turn it back off you have to wait for it to die.  [END]
[BEGIN] I can t seem to get this strap to the point where I know it won t drop my camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very disappointed, needed my software tools to get the going. Did not stated in description.  [END]
[BEGIN] when i purchased this, i do not remember it saying things were not included, i can almost remember it saying it was a complete kit. NEver been out of the box, since hubby knoew it wasn t complete kit.  [END]
[BEGIN] The product did not fit the camera body properly and was a waste of money.  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera spins all around. Terrible extension pole. just by the &#34;GoPro&#34; made products. They are more expensive but the quality speaks for itself.  [END]
[BEGIN] Product was missing POE injector. I ordered 5 none of them came with a free POE injector as mentioned in listing.  [END]
[BEGIN] This stabilizer is a piece of junk. Save yourself the trouble and just buy a glide cam.  [END]
[BEGIN] dosen t stick to the surface of my Jeep dash.  [END]
[BEGIN] This camera conveniently stopped working just after the return period passed. Cheap, flimsy, and apparently breaks easily. Stay away from it!  [END]
[BEGIN] This didn t work!  [END]
[BEGIN] It is impossible to use the camera without completely removing the upper part of the case. It s just to tight for flexible use.  [END]
[BEGIN] for some reason don t work  [END]

[BEGIN] Did not fit my camera  [END]
[BEGIN] Cameras were too low rez.  [END]
[BEGIN] Takes great photos BUT never drop it. The camera fell from my pants pocket and never worked correctly again. Customer service from Nikon was very disappointing. I would never order another Nikon product ever.  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera picture is great, but significantly limited by constant dropping of wireless connections despite strong signal. Worse it then fails to reconnect without rebooting. Maybe a firmware upgrade will improve the situation, but hard to recommend as an outdoor wireless solution.  [END]
[BEGIN] first of all this tripod is 45&#34; tall not 50&#34; as advertised. It is also incredibly flimsy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Didn t work!! Don t buy  [END]
[BEGIN] I can t believe this was rated as highly as it is. Everything about this is so cheap. The velcro and the panels all show up like eye sores in photographs. Even if I could iron out the creases it still wouldn t be useable. Really disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] The background is see through really doesn t work well with photography we shooting with our something dark in back of it  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a horrible product! Do not buy! The image is distorted around the edges with no sharpness at all! I will be asking for a refund! Yes you get a wider angle but what good is it when you loose all sharpness around the edges!  [END]

[BEGIN] Sound quality of the voice of the person wearing the pen sucks. Is not compatible with Windows 8. Besides that the return was seamless.  [END]

[BEGIN] Had it set on a time to run during the day. Stopped turning on after 3 months.  [END]

[BEGIN] Does not fit go pro 4 black like advertized ended up breaking my 499 dollar camera trying to make it fit-- horrible do not reccomend  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing worked. Returned.  [END]
[BEGIN] A complete waste of money. All photos are blurry. Shutter speed is too slow. Either spend more money and purchase a high quality waterproof camera or use a disposable underwater film camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is awful and a big mistake to buy such item  [END]
[BEGIN] The film only works at night time. Very disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was one of the best products I have ever bought yet. I had to sell my siblings, house, and car to buy this but it was worth it. Jk about selling my siblings.  [END]

[BEGIN] I expected a waterproof screen cover  [END]
[BEGIN] HORRIBLE CAMERA. Takes decent photos outside but if you plan on taking photos inside be prepared to be hugely disappointed. Really disappointed with the quality of this camera. Len s cap wouldn t even stay on.  [END]

[BEGIN] It didn t work for my Sony digital camcorder..  [END]
[BEGIN] It was awesome for the 1 hour it worked, then one of the rotors stopped working and that was that. Great fun for the little time it worked. Other than that get another drone that won t crap out on you.  [END]

[BEGIN] Buyer Beware: After purchasing this, I begun getting spam email from SterlingTek.  [END]
[BEGIN] Threads were so badly created during manufacturing, the thing won t work at all. Total junk from day one.  [END]
[BEGIN] Product overheats under reasonable use (1-2 hours), making it completely unsuitable for professional use. Was using this for a high-profile shoot with a celebrity and it started flickering and turning on and off every second. Ruined the scene and embarrassed the crew. Faulty product and should be removed from Amazon!  [END]
[BEGIN] This LCD protector: This protector was useless, without adherence to the screen of my Alpha 77 II and the bubbles made it impossible to display the same. It was necessary to dismiss it, total loss. Excuse me.  [END]

[BEGIN] Does not work  [END]
[BEGIN] doesn t fit as original one fits, cap is falling off quite often  [END]
[BEGIN] Do not buy this. I didn t even receive the same model as in the description and it barely worked. After the first time I charged it, it worked for ten minutes and now nothing. What a disappointment.  [END]

[BEGIN] My old camera case is better than this one.  [END]
[BEGIN] Plastic snapped off, weak for larger phones, I have an LG G3  [END]
[BEGIN] Awful Shoulder strap. Every time you raise the camera quickly, the strap gets tangled in the D ring. This makes the product useless as it prevents a quick draw. Bought a Cotton Carrier and never looked back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Unfortunately, I couldn t get it to work :(  [END]
[BEGIN] sent back. the eye doc gives bigger cloths than these/The size of a postage stamp!!!  [END]

[BEGIN] The service was very good, but the glasses doesn t work.  [END]
[BEGIN] No records goes to the battery being charged, it has given me too many problems  [END]

[BEGIN] awful camera, doesn t include everything you need as well as just an awful camera I would highly recommend not buying it  [END]
[BEGIN] Very poor quality. Pictures are dark, sometimes scrambled, and strange signs are sometimes shown instead of pictures. I’ve always had good luck with Amazon, but these frames are definitely not as advertised.  [END]

[BEGIN] Camera did not recognize this battery as Info-Lithium.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does not work  [END]
[BEGIN] My tv lamp popped five minutes after I put it in, the glass on it was in pieces, the product was defective, I have bought this product before and it took a year for it to do that, so I was very unsatified this time around  [END]
[BEGIN] Literally bs, pay so much for so little and such bad quality. It s like there s a horrible filter on every picture. Don t waste your time haha  [END]
[BEGIN] I m having issues with charging it will not take a charge at all. I purchased the extended warranty with it but I m not sure how to claim it. Any help would be great.  [END]
[BEGIN] The battery was about a millimeter off from the correct size, so it would only make momentary and unreliable contact with the Canon camera s battery housing, which made it unusable. Had to send it back. Return was handled promptly, but I would recommend using another retailer for this battery.  [END]
[BEGIN] I sent the product back. It didn t hold time. Nor was it user friendly. It also only recorded short clips.  [END]
[BEGIN] When I got it seemed OK after recording one time tried to record again when I needed it would not even light up. I had even charged it up to make sure had full charge.  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible product. Has a bounce upon each revolution of the bearings.  [END]

[BEGIN] The camera and lens that comes with it are a good quality, all the other stuff is junk and not even compatable with this camera  [END]
[BEGIN] Bad quality  [END]

[BEGIN] don t buy it doesn t work with 1DX :(  [END]
[BEGIN] Conterfeit item,does not work for nikon camera  [END]

[BEGIN] The screw in plate that connects to the camera tripod mount was not threaded. There is at least one other reviewer that had the same problem.  [END]
[BEGIN] Could not see a thing during night or day!! Returned.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very cheap looking and sheer.  [END]
[BEGIN] I must have older Flip...these wont plug into mine goofed again  [END]
[BEGIN] Not worth the money. Does not fit properly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Magnet not sticky enough  [END]
[BEGIN] I changed all the settings on the back to self timer on my Canon 6d and I could not get this remote to work. I even replaced the battery inside to see if that was the issue & it still didn t work. Having to return it. :(  [END]
[BEGIN] Neat camera with great features. Like using it with my phone but the app is a little weak. Wifi stopped working after a few months and now the camera is worthless. Too Bad!  [END]
[BEGIN] NO! It didn t! The darn thing didn t even work! I hope NOONE ever buys anything from Discount Jungle ever again! They are crooked! Update: July 2016- I NEVER got a replacement camera or my money back!  [END]
[BEGIN] It doesn t work  [END]
[BEGIN] This crap will void your gopro warrentee, do not purchase it.  [END]
[BEGIN] just a tipp to the EU customs offices. This device MUST NOT be imported to the EU because of a lack of user manual in EU languages. The user manual is only chines which has to be taken ass an afront to EU regulations and againt EU customers.  [END]
[BEGIN] Didn t work with my Nikon D750 even though it says it is compatible. I spent an additional $5 for a new battery and still doesn t work. Save yourself the hassle and some money in the long run by passing on this and buying the Nikon brand.  [END]
[BEGIN] Maybe it was me but I could not get the thing to zoom in and see anything. I returned it.  [END]
[BEGIN] I bought this as a baby monitor and it does not work. The recording lags sometimes minutes behind real time or will time out completely. Nothing scares a new mother more than to wake up and see the video frozen.  [END]
[BEGIN] Motion detector does not work properly need to send it back to get exchange  [END]
[BEGIN] I knew Bolide for good quality security equipment, but this change my mind, i bought 8 units, and 5 are defective, during almost 4 months of working well, 5 of 8, got a bad image. Really disappointed for this bad experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] This camera was the most difficult installation I have ever come across (updates are way too complicated) and support and software was lacking. Would not recommend this camera to anyone!.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lasted 3 months as a backup battery and stopped working completely.  [END]
[BEGIN] Useless junk - it burned both my original Canon batteries - do not buy!  [END]

[BEGIN] Bought this at Khols and it could not install on my computer or my dad s. We tried everything! What a huge waste of money.  [END]
[BEGIN] I returned this after a few days - difficult to use, doesn t work in low light, and recording time is extremely limited.  [END]
[BEGIN] the flash works but does not work with my canon 5Ti also, the flash is not the one where you can remotely use on its own.  [END]

[BEGIN] Within 24 hours of regular, everyday kind of use, it stopped working. Boo.  [END]

[BEGIN] Plastic price and plactic piece.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Package I received didnt had the screw to be used to mount the go Pro. I have highlighted it in the image.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pure Junk.  [END]
[BEGIN] I only managed to get one session from this when the screw from the ball joint came out. Tried screwing back in and there no threading at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] Replaced the originally item only to find out the replacement is just as bad. The adjustment dial doesn t not change.  [END]
[BEGIN] Images were not sharp at any distance, with and without a tripod. The original lens came with original Kit was excellent. I am returning it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Don t fit good even though size is correct  [END]
[BEGIN] Broke the first time my 5y/o used it  [END]
[BEGIN] Less than a year old and will not charge to full capacity. Doesn t last very long. After charging overnight it only had about 30 minutes of charge.  [END]
[BEGIN] One battery charged and performed adequately, but one battery would not charge and caused a &#34;battery not compatible&#34; error.  [END]
[BEGIN] Instruction are only in chinese. I am wondering how to conect it.  [END]
[BEGIN] I would never buy again. The only reason I didn t return is because I ran wire around my home. Never again  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheap and hideous  [END]
[BEGIN] The tension pieces broke the first time I put it on the camera. Now it s useless.  [END]
[BEGIN] The quality of the picture is very poor. My iPhone s camera takes better pictures.  [END]
[BEGIN] totally and completely worthless. extremely unstable. check out the how small the legs are. unless you are using a tiny COMPACT mini camera it will cost you a broken camera. MOST IMPORTANTLY THE SELLER IS TERRIBLE. RESTOCKING CHARGES AND AN ATTITUDE MAKES YOU WISH YOU NEVER BOUGHT FROM THIS SELLER.  [END]
[BEGIN] Broke after a week  [END]
[BEGIN] Constant issue with the power supply  [END]
[BEGIN] Crapy product. Save your money and get a promaster. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008SSMYZ0?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00  [END]
[BEGIN] LCD quality is very low, contrast is very bad using with my GH4, don t recommend it much.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wasn t loud at all, could barely hear it  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible product, too many problems to waste my time writing about it ,no customer service ,just find another company then Lorex , and I don t normally write a 1 star review but this product and company did it ....  [END]
[BEGIN] If you re a Pro. Don t do it. Spend the extra money for the Canon. I should have just thrown $70 down the toilet. Live and Learn...  [END]
[BEGIN] Did not fit my lenses. The adapter fit into my camera body fine, but the lens mount was wrong. Ended up returning.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very cheap quality. It wasnt out of the box and it was broken! DO NOT WASTE YOUR 11 DOLLARS JUST MAKE THE INVESTMENT IN A GOOD TRIPOD!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] this does not work well, the setup is confusing the company will charge you to help set it up. I did get it to work after 4 hours but the recording process stinks. I don t recommend this product at all  [END]
[BEGIN] Works but it s stuck on my Nikon.  [END]
[BEGIN] fabric is much lighter than show. It s pastel blue instead of the deep blue with dark accents. Very disappointed!  [END]

[BEGIN] it works as long as you don t try to go over 5 feet..  [END]
[BEGIN] Not A mirror, very small , very low quality  [END]
[BEGIN] These came without all parts. It said in the listing there was no manual, so I was expecting that.I was not expecting it to come with no peer sources. I had to ship it back  [END]
[BEGIN] It says on the site that it is compatible with the T5i but in the book that comes with the remote it does not say it is compatible and I cannot get it to connect to my camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] wy too small to use with a selfie stick! will work if you use the clamp from the stick for your phone or have a camera with a 1/4x20 hole in your device but that s about it. I need something with a wider stance (longer legs).  [END]
[BEGIN] Save your money! This is a piece of junk. The software is terrible and there is NO US support. Try emails to China. Look at the other reviews; all written by the same person. Buy a camera which has a US presence and support.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the green pens is totally dry and doesn t work at all. Out of ten pens, only four show up on a black paper. The box is broken.  [END]
[BEGIN] I would like to know if the little screw that s long enough for the P3S is sold anywhere? The one supplied is not long enough to mount to the rc mount to eyelet.  [END]
[BEGIN] Got a couple of these. Both went down within a day of putting them up. I hooked them up to all 5 of my camera systems and they didn t work on any of them. One did last an hour longer than the other. Won t do that again...  [END]
[BEGIN] Swivel section will not turn more than a few degrees! Had to move the whole unit to video.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not user friendly and the owners manual is worthless. Find another product that is easier to use and more reliable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Smaller than advertised :(  [END]
[BEGIN] Didn t work. Manual had instructions for a different model. Honestly, I wish I had just spent the extra few dollars for a decent one  [END]
[BEGIN] heavy, flat look at objects  [END]
[BEGIN] The logo does not look like what it shows in the picture!!!! Instead of the embroidered letters, it s actually an ugly piece of black rubber attached onto the bag. :(  [END]
[BEGIN] This battery died very quickly on me.  [END]
[BEGIN] The cameras have only been up a little over a week now and two out of four no longer even work. Is this set of security cameras junk? I paid an additional $100 to have them mounted on the outside. And I am out a lot of money now.  [END]
[BEGIN] Would not fit my camera. Should have read reviews before ordering.  [END]
[BEGIN] It okay the press button does work to good  [END]
[BEGIN] it doesn t last and it gets hot  [END]
[BEGIN] None of the pictures came out. They were too dark.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not impressed, already the large thumbscrew has strip out. The quality is very questionable which is my reason for one star.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not that much good quality video  [END]
[BEGIN] Bought one along With the camera but the lens cover on the case was cracked and felling apart Just by taking it off the bag, by mistake I bought two cases and the other one was fine but Im second guessing on submerging this case With the camera incide  [END]
[BEGIN] It is too small for my Nikon D3000  [END]
[BEGIN] I ve had nothing but problems with it, from the wheels falling off, to the knobs not holding their position to an unfixable wobble, the problems are endless. Invest in something better than this, you ll be glad you did.  [END]
[BEGIN] My old worn out battery holds better charge that this new one... I don t recommend it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Did not come as pictured. Connectors are female to RCA, not female to female  [END]
[BEGIN] Don t bother with these. They fall apart and are easily lost. My husband lost 2 in 2 days. Money down the drain. Buy better ones.  [END]
[BEGIN] Screen became washed out after 40 days.  [END]
[BEGIN] Returned  [END]
[BEGIN] To hard to get loaded on pc , light weight and moves around to much on your face and you can t tell if you are recording or not  [END]
[BEGIN] This product is a piece of crap I tried to get my money back but they never responed  [END]
[BEGIN] Junk. Brand new and don t hold a charge.  [END]
[BEGIN] absolute trash  [END]
[BEGIN] I received this and wanted to charge the battery for my son. It didn t charge, I don t know whether the battery is bad or the actual charger. :(  [END]
[BEGIN] LEAVE ME ALONE!  [END]
[BEGIN] Returned for refund as they were not genuine GoPro items, as advertised. All of the other items I purchased WERE genuine.  [END]
[BEGIN] trash!!!!!! original battery with 1030mAh working in two times longer than this batteries with 2300 mAh  [END]
[BEGIN] The battery is listed as DMW-BCF10PP but i received BCF-10E which is a different voltage and mAH rating so i had to return it.  [END]
[BEGIN] don t buy it !!!!!! went up smoke !!!!!!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] The LEDs are grossly underpowered. It wont even light up an area 10 feet away. I m sorry I bought it. Used to sell for over a hundred dollars? Baloney!  [END]
[BEGIN] Fake toy, None of the sensors were accurate, not even close.  [END]
[BEGIN] I bought this for nikkon p900.. But it too small to store it..  [END]

[BEGIN] terrible  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera won t connect to phone. App won t let me sign in on tablet. They shipped a color they didn t even have as an option. Instructions had details wrong. No troubleshooting in instructions. Did I forget anything? Now I have to get my money back.  [END]

[BEGIN] Doesn t work  [END]
[BEGIN] The package that i got didnt work  [END]
[BEGIN] quality...You must be kidding  [END]
[BEGIN] Need to return this. It never worked. Worst product I ve ever ordered off of Amazon. It turned on but would not record anything. Then was unable to turn it off. Seriously do not buy this.  [END]
[BEGIN] I thought it would be perfect and ordered one. The product did not work and even when changing the batteries, it still did not work. I ll try another product and see if I have better luck.  [END]
[BEGIN] I ordered 2 and got 1 not pleased  [END]
[BEGIN] did not fit my lens  [END]
[BEGIN] Item broke within a week. Money wasted on something that didn t work.  [END]

[BEGIN] did not work as expected. returned  [END]
[BEGIN] photo instructions are NO value. There is no visible way to connect the wires to the power terminals.  [END]
[BEGIN] It only lasted a few months and it no longer holds a charge. The original battery that came with my camera is still going strong after three years. Over $36.00 and I had to throw it away.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not what I was expected, to cheap.  [END]
[BEGIN] It filled up with water and sunk the first time I used it.  [END]
[BEGIN] [[VIDEOID:32726b0daee64c9d77072690c0baf647]]Unfortunately just a few days outside the one month return window the camera broke. The record button no longer works. Since I cannot return it I took it apart and the button is stuck in its housing so it is not fixable.  [END]
[BEGIN] THIS THING DOESNT COME WITH THE REQUIRED 12V POWER ADAPTER!!!!!! I don t know how well it works yet. Gotta buy a power source...... lame  [END]
[BEGIN] Unhappy with stiffness  [END]

[BEGIN] It did not work, I had to return it and get my money back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Didn t fit at all on my Camileo X100 video camera. Difficult to find the right cap for that. Universal means it should fit, right?  [END]
[BEGIN] Some of the parts are useful , most I found won t fit the camera,poor engineering I believe, stick with the go pro accessories! The case as far as I can see was not made to hold the camera securely and not well thought out.  [END]
[BEGIN] These frames are cheap plastic and they do NOT work! I ve been trying to get the company to take them back and give me a refund, to no avail! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT! COMPLETE RIP OFF! And lousy customer service.  [END]

[BEGIN] Cannot recommend. Shoe would not even fit in my Nikon.  [END]
[BEGIN] Did not charge my camera :(  [END]

[BEGIN] Would not work with my camera/lens.  [END]
[BEGIN] Unusable. Plastic flexes rather than grips.  [END]
[BEGIN] Duds...batteries don t fully charge  [END]
[BEGIN] This does not work at all with the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 I bought at the same time. I want to return it.  [END]
[BEGIN] I could not see any improvement from normal phone lens.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not beginner friendly at all. I ve been trying to balance it for almost 4 hours now, didn t work at all. Still trying, looked at the CD, every tutorial on youtube. I find it impossible  [END]
[BEGIN] Came off and left a permanent residue on my screen.  [END]
[BEGIN] Couldn t get it to work properly. Would up in the trash with my old one.  [END]
[BEGIN] it did not work well it only work for 15 mini and that is all  [END]
[BEGIN] It broke the first time I used it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Beware! This third party Seller does DOES NOT ALLOW ANY RETURNS!!! Make sure this cable is compatible with your particular camera - is works with only select Canon digital cameras.  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera did not make clear pictures and did not satisfy me. Very blurry images and wasted very expensive film on this. very disappointed in my purchase.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does not work  [END]
[BEGIN] Gave it a one star because when I received it, it didn t work, if only it had a return address maybe I would give it a higher rating.  [END]
[BEGIN] The quality is beyond poor…and there are Chinese characters on the back of the paper frame, the color is terrible as well. I threw them all.  [END]
[BEGIN] These just run out of juice too fast!! Only last a couple of days!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Felt flimsy. Plastic, light weight. On/Off button sticks. Sent it back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Did not work at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] The product NEVER worked. Battery wouldn t hold a charge and the zoom wouldn t work. Couldn t get any decent pictures. Photos all disappeared every time the battery died. Who thought this one up?  [END]
[BEGIN] Silly product and has no sleeve. VERY disapointing.  [END]
[BEGIN] very Packaging bad and quality bad  [END]
[BEGIN] All ready malfunctioning  [END]
[BEGIN] Complete scam, f n cons, false advertising,...get a rope!  [END]
[BEGIN] cant return and has not user manual!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Low quality. Globe just fell off after just a couple of days.  [END]
[BEGIN] The battery I received did not work even after hours of charging. The charger itself felt cheap and unreliable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Within the first week, the main zipper broke. Within about a month all the smaller side pocket zippers were broken. Such a shame because this is a nice looking bag and otherwise sturdy. But you just can t use the bag with ALL zippers broken!  [END]
[BEGIN] Not ready for prime time. Very poor internet server. As with all internet accessible services, if the company shuts down, its server will and you will have nothing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Do not waste $12. Poor quality. Stitching for drawstring closure broke just after two days of use. Small pouch useless; too small  [END]
[BEGIN] this camera doesn t even have a mic port so how can it be for this camera?  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheap, useless camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] DO NOT BUY ! I have 3 of these systems and on every system 2 cameras on each system went bad If you know what is good fo you don t buy this junk. DON T BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] SO SO SO glitchy. I only get this to record about 30% of the time. Battery life is s***. I hate this helmet camera, it has let me down so many times.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very very small  [END]
[BEGIN] This material is is extremely abrasive. Compared to the factory strap (only a few bucks more) it seems to be made from old pot scrubbers.  [END]
[BEGIN] FALSE ADVERTISING. This case does NOT fit Lumix camera, specifically the DMC-G6. This case is too small, and will not physically enclose the camera. Do not waste your time or money. RETURNED.  [END]
[BEGIN] Even at $4 this is a waste of money. The cheap vinyl smells awful, there are loose threads, and the fit is cludgy. Immediately replaced it with a good quality strap for only $12.  [END]
[BEGIN] I don t understand why you can t get the one which pops directly on instead, they have this Velcro held diffuser which flies off sometimes, no bueno, it works though ughhh  [END]
[BEGIN] Came with an EU adapter. Was unable to use. Did not mention this in the product description!  [END]
[BEGIN] Hard to set up for recording, I return and switch to some other brand that can record!  [END]
[BEGIN] Not easy to assemble.  [END]
[BEGIN] The picture of this charger shows it as a dual charger for charging 2 batteries at once. I ordered 2 since I have 6 batteries I keep charged for my professional photography business. I was sent two standard plug in chargers. This is false advertising! Buyer Beware!!  [END]
[BEGIN] If you try to figure out how to work this thing-good luck! Whoever translated the instructions from the Chinese obviously forgot to learn English! It s indecipherable goobledygoop.  [END]
[BEGIN] Broke less than 2 fays after receiving this product. Not happy with this service at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] The bundle did not come with the camera wall mount like shown in the picture and also in the description. Contacted company and the response I received back was that the bundle did not come with any additional lenses (I was not asking for a lense).  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst instructions ever seen. Can t understand how to set time or clear value memory. Maybe the instructions are for a different model.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked fine for a day. I originally purchased this for a trip out of the country. The day I was leaving I tested the camera and it wouldn t work. Ended up having to buy another camera last minute. Not happy with this purchase at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was very happy at first. I installed the battery and everything seemed great until I tried to charge it. Thats when i figured out I got ripped off. Very disappointed. I have a new battery that I can t charge.  [END]
[BEGIN] Don t bother getting this. It arrived already broken and felt fragile anyway. Not worth the money if it even did work.  [END]
[BEGIN] Did not work on my pc. Instructions are confusing therefore will be returning the product.  [END]

[BEGIN] Cheaply made...The shaft broke after one us......  [END]
[BEGIN] The thumbscrew was missing for the gopro stand and the thumbscrews that originally came with my gopro hero3+ weren t compatible for some reason- which is too bad. It s really light and would have been great for backpacking trips.  [END]

[BEGIN] There is no off switch You must remove the battery to turn it off  [END]
[BEGIN] The camera would not turn on.  [END]

[BEGIN] It doesn t work. The battery never charges and the light of charge doesn t work. The app doesn t exist!! Sad you sell a not working product  [END]
[BEGIN] My camera doesn t have a snug place to place it. I am using it because I couldn t wait for another but once I have enough money I will purchase a better one.  [END]
[BEGIN] Doesn t have enough storage and broke after only a few uses.  [END]
[BEGIN] box was opened returned it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Send item back was to big  [END]
[BEGIN] Dead on arrival. Not worth the print to advertise it. A peice of junk!  [END]
[BEGIN] Outrageously expensive for a camera for which you cannot buy good film - all film for this camera has been discontinued or is expired.  [END]
[BEGIN] Did not buy this item  [END]
[BEGIN] 3 days past the 30 days return policy and stopped taking a charge! I would think that an expensive item like this would last more than 30 days guess not! Maybe thats why they only offer 30 days?!?!?!?!  [END]
[BEGIN] Item did not specify what it could (or could not ) fit. This does not fit a Nikon D60 so I had to return.  [END]

[BEGIN] Sucks  [END]
[BEGIN] can not loop record and destroy 3 of my SD card  [END]

[BEGIN] Broke first day!  [END]
[BEGIN] it does not work for Samsung cameras - not for NX. The NX screen flips up and the hinges are on the upper side. Impossible to mount on those cameras  [END]

[BEGIN] Really upset that I only got 6 prints out of each pack when it claimed to have 10 prints per pack!  [END]
[BEGIN] I received a used filter with finger prints on it and multiple chips on the glass, they were needle size tips chips but none the less, I was under the impression that I was getting a new filter. Very disappointed, going to stick to buy my filter from B&H Photo  [END]
[BEGIN] Nowhere in the description (or product packaging) does it say that it is ONLY usable with the &#34;Swann&#34; brand receiver. Bought this as an add on to a different brand wireless system, it will not connect.  [END]
[BEGIN] Do not buy this product, after days trying different things to make it work it will not detect the cameras, its not worth the headache, it does not work, buy something else.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lasted a few hours with its first charge, which is fine. But with subswquent charges it only held its charge for about 30 minutes or less before dying. Sucky.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was not able to use. Even though it was a replacement for Bf808u, the wall unit nor car charger was correct.  [END]
[BEGIN] Broke within minutes. Seller said the faulty part would be replaced, months later, nothing  [END]
[BEGIN] You can t wear it, inside is the hat there s a hard plastic shell to keep the wiring from you head so the hat doesn t stay on your head. This was a waste of money for me not a good purchase.  [END]

[BEGIN] Won t stay on!  [END]
[BEGIN] It works like few weeks now after few days It was not working. I am not sure its battery or remote control by it self.  [END]
[BEGIN] Useless. Faulty design. Returned it.  [END]
[BEGIN] It doesn t work! I opened it and the screen won t turn on  [END]

[BEGIN] IT WAS THE WRONG CHARGER  [END]

[BEGIN] Generic lens failure reported on google search. Returned.  [END]
[BEGIN] I am very unhappy with this product as we have been unable to connect it to the internet and numerous calls to the company s tech support have only resulted in frustration. It is a huge waste of money since it can t be set up.  [END]

[BEGIN] The binoculars had a very strong noxious odor from the rubberized coating.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was broken when I opened the box!  [END]

[BEGIN] After using the camera 8 Times( bought july 22nd) one button stop working. I just checked the return policy and just expired the 30 days window. What should i do?  [END]
[BEGIN] The grip was not equipped to attach to the camera. A 2nd one was ordered and it was also missing the connection between the grip and the camera body.  [END]
[BEGIN] Was not the quality of camera I was expecting. No instruction manual to tell you about the camera settings or how to use them. Accessories not for the same camera. So disappointed.........  [END]

[BEGIN] very small size, puffy, not comportable  [END]

[BEGIN] not for a nex 3  [END]
[BEGIN] I guess I missed the part about this being a flimsy tripod, but then you get what you pay for I guess.  [END]

[BEGIN] They didn t explain how to use them so they are pretty worthless.  [END]
[BEGIN] This product may work well, but I wanted and expected it to be white (looks very white on your web site). It is gray!! Now what?  [END]
[BEGIN] This charger worked great for 3 months and then died.  [END]
[BEGIN] We got these for our Arlo security system. Even fully charged, they did not show as &#34;fully charged&#34; They were dead in a matter of hours. Definitely not worth the price.  [END]

[BEGIN] Never work....... Waist of money.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does not support the weight of my standard digital slr camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] cannot get sound to work and pic quality is real bad, will never get another one.  [END]

[BEGIN] Say somthing and comes opposite  [END]
[BEGIN] Not even got the charge, and this is the second one i bough from Amazon the first one was broken at the time of delivery.  [END]

[BEGIN] Hard to setup. And battery life sucks. Will be returning it  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked for about 1 second with the new batteries that I purchased with this order. Back it goes!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Poor quality. You can get the same quality for $4 in Chinatown  [END]
[BEGIN] did not work well.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was a European model so the power supply had a European plug Had to call and buy a 120v power supply...bummer  [END]
[BEGIN] i can t believe this. the software is on amazon although foxhole has stopped supporting it. so why was it sold to me and why did i waste my time learning how to use a software that is no longer supported? This is a matter worthy of litigation  [END]
[BEGIN] Junk. I was trying to save money but instead got a flash that fell apart, didn t work, and took up space in my bag. Spend the extra and get the one for your camera from the manufacture.  [END]
[BEGIN] Defective  [END]
[BEGIN] Watch for Warranty! Got 2 of this a couple of month ago and 1 got out of order, and Hikvision refused it s warranty coverage. Very bad![[ASIN:B00G7GMEOG Hikvision DS-2CD2032-I Outdoor HD 3MP IP Bullet Security Camera 4mm]]  [END]

[BEGIN] I have purchased six Yongnuo flash units in the past and was completely satisfies that I got my monies worth. This is the first unit that I m dissatisfied with.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have had this replaced three times in the past week. None of them work. Two of the batteries warped upon first use. CHEAPEST PRODUCT EVER DO NOT BUY  [END]
[BEGIN] This is not worth the money I spent on it and will be sending it back I and very disappointed with this  [END]
[BEGIN] Use it twice never damaged it but it started shutting off by itself I guess the product had it defects  [END]
[BEGIN] The description should be changed. You cannot get film for this camera. It is useless ! Do not buy! If you want to look at it or collect them then but it. If you want to use it you are out of luck!  [END]
[BEGIN] Bought last year, was still in unopened package and installed last week. Waited because I was undergoing chemo. Replaced battery, doesn t work at all. After reading multiple other reviews where people received ones that never worked, I would give this item a -1 if I could.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheaply built, sound quality was extremely poor, and I could barely hear the sound. Would not recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sorry, but this was a piece of junk. It s cheap plastic like a table cloth from the dollar store. It came crushed and wrinkled and I was never able to get the wrinkles out in order to use it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera uses unusual means of releasing the shutter. There is a ring outboard of the zoom ring, that must be pressed just right to release the shutter. My technicians had great difficulty getting the shutter to release on several occasions.  [END]
[BEGIN] I just got the chance to try it right now. it is cheap material product, it s broke right away.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is not working after a week!  [END]

[BEGIN] The harness broke tge first time we put it on. Cheap!  [END]
[BEGIN] junk  [END]
[BEGIN] They have great instructional videos n the product is easy to manipulate however, due to flimsy materials used it does not function as advertised. Expected stronger parts...seems like a $25 product instead.  [END]

[BEGIN] The neck broke on the second use... Very cheap plastic.  [END]
[BEGIN] Charger didn t last a week and batteries won t keep a charGe  [END]

[BEGIN] I did not receive a Kodak battery. I received a Halcyon battery, which would not recharge. Since I ve misplaced the receipt, I can t return it. I have purchased a Radio Shack battery instead of trying to order one again.  [END]
[BEGIN] in day time is perfect but in night cant see anything i not return because is really difficult take it off but i don t recommend to no body  [END]
[BEGIN] parts where missing  [END]
[BEGIN] Don t waste your money on this battery grip for the Sony a6000. It is a piece of junk.  [END]

[BEGIN] The instructions are terrible. We still can t figure how to make it work!!  [END]
[BEGIN] This was advertised a product with the Canon camera I purchased so I wrongly thought it would fit the camera and it doesn t. Much too small for the camera I bought so it is useless to me  [END]

[BEGIN] The software sucks. The fingerprint reader is terrible. Highly NOT RECOMMENDED.  [END]
[BEGIN] The sharpness, rather better say non-sharpness after using this ND filters is terrible. I tested on high shutter speed, tripod mounted. The images is not usable. Buy expensive good quality filters or don t buy at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] cheap crap- but I paid cheap--- you really need to get a TALLER tripod  [END]
[BEGIN] Work the first time coming out of the box. The next day? It stopped working.  [END]

[BEGIN] flimsy  [END]
[BEGIN] pain to use  [END]
[BEGIN] Poor video view and it don t have a HDMI on it  [END]
[BEGIN] Sucks no other word to describe this item. A good looking watch I ll give it that but everything else sucks  [END]

[BEGIN] Everything was fine.  [END]

[BEGIN] When I used it the water went there waterproof Case do t buy This  [END]
[BEGIN] did not focus waste of time and money  [END]

[BEGIN] Horrible camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] wrong cord  [END]
[BEGIN] Return it  [END]
[BEGIN] The ring does not work at all !! It is not possible to focus properly with any FD-lens, probably due to the inserted ekstra lens in the adapter. Waste of Money ! Frank Visti  [END]
[BEGIN] this gooseneck is worthless, it is almost impossible to twist (massive grip between the joints) and any flexion or shortening (separating the joints) causes them to fracture. Boooo!  [END]
[BEGIN] The leg post will not work after a few uses. The locking mechanism is cheaply made and, after a short time, will break. I can only use it from a sitting position now - not standing as the legs will not elongate anymore. Very disappointing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sent this back. I m not a rocket scientist.  [END]
[BEGIN] The remote did not work with my canon 5D as indicated.  [END]
[BEGIN] we used it twice and one of the propellers stopped working. don t know how to get ahold of anyone for parts and if there is a warranty  [END]
[BEGIN] pretty sure this is copy write infringement... or at the very least toeing the line. http://store.froknowsphoto.com/  [END]
[BEGIN] Returned the product. Items were missing from a sealed box.  [END]
[BEGIN] The add listed this as a Panasonic Lumix charger. It is a GENERIC charger that barely even works and it is so bulky it won t fit into my small camera bag like the original Panasonic charger did.  [END]
[BEGIN] Missing half of what s in the listing  [END]
[BEGIN] I bought this screen protector and was excited to use it. I put it on my D7100 and it s immediately cracked on the right corner. I m terribly disappointed with this product and I will be returning it immediately.  [END]

[BEGIN] Total pain in the butt to set up!!  [END]
[BEGIN] excellent item, solved my problem  [END]
[BEGIN] Was not what I expected!  [END]
[BEGIN] Product was described to work with go pro camera mounts. The mount would not tighten to secure the go pro. Reached out to the seller with no response. Extremely disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible what a waste of my hard earned money is all I can say! I did not even want to give it a star pretty sorry!  [END]
[BEGIN] This doesnt even deserve one star.  [END]
[BEGIN] The swabs were different sizes and all it did was smear cleaning solution on my sensor. I ended up having to pay to have it professionally cleaned anyway.  [END]
[BEGIN] Received replacement, worse than the first, all the unit does it vibrate, then shuts off, then starts to continuously vibrate again without any input from the remote, remote is totally useless. Starting to believe that there is no quality control or testing before sending these products out.  [END]
[BEGIN] Blocked out too much light. Couldn t see much with it and when I returned it I had to pay the shipping  [END]
[BEGIN] The instructions on disk do not go well with this clock. The buttons are not labeled the same or even close to what is in the instructions. I don t have the time to decode it. I wouldn t make this purchase again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Came missing parts.  [END]
[BEGIN] Much larger and bulkier than I thought it d be.  [END]
[BEGIN] [[ASIN:B00OV9IB2A Spy Tec STI_ZIR32 Surveillance Cameras]]  [END]
[BEGIN] The plug was obviously corroded before it was shipped out. I should have taken the other recent reviews at face value.  [END]
[BEGIN] what was advertised as a &#34;kit&#34; containing mini tripod and micro sd card, was just the case.  [END]
[BEGIN] Arrived broken!  [END]
[BEGIN] Stopped working and I waited to long to return it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does the job but overpriced!  [END]
[BEGIN] When I bought this as a stand alone wireless camera and it was no such thing. This camera is an add on to a system that has a special screen and receiver.  [END]
[BEGIN] App wouldn t work.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tip kept coming off and was lost after the 2nd day. Poor quality, junk.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just had it professionally installed for it to not even work! it looked legit and brand new so never thought about asking them to test it first.  [END]

[BEGIN] This is junk  [END]
[BEGIN] This tripod would not seat my camera firmly against the base, effectively making it useless. The screw to attach the camera was did not have long enough threads to pull the camera tight. It wobbled like crazy even when screwed all the way in. This was with my Pentax K-50.  [END]
[BEGIN] Quit funtionjng after a week!  [END]
[BEGIN] The video sunglasses mp3 Is not working.  [END]
[BEGIN] They never worked I m so upset, I ve bought different spyglasses and have worked well, but this purchase was sadly a mistake.  [END]
[BEGIN] Arrived with a broken plastic clip rail, so I had to tape the battery in while it charged.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not as described at all. Seller did make up for it!  [END]
[BEGIN] The hood doesn t fit properly on my Pentax lens.  [END]
[BEGIN] NO WHERE in the advertising did it say for GoPro 3 or earlier models. Does not work with any GoPro 4. Huge disappointment.  [END]
[BEGIN] The frame lasted as long as the time that it was too late to return,  [END]
[BEGIN] Too complicated for me. I thought it was Wireless so there would be no wired connections  [END]
[BEGIN] Only wanted one set of two but must have double ordered as I got and paid for two sets  [END]
[BEGIN] Plastic. Cheap. Threw it away.  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything about the description of this product is miss leading. Will not purchase from this seller again. The light does not come with AAA batteries and it is only one light.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does not come with flash  [END]
[BEGIN] tripod will not hold the camera  [END]
[BEGIN] Rotors broke after first use. Charger cable cannot be decoupled so I haven t been able to charge the copter.  [END]

[BEGIN] terrible. doesn t fit fuji battery or batteries that came with it, which were both dead.  [END]
[BEGIN] If the camera lens on your phone isn t in the middle of the phone it doesn t line up. Even if it did work well it isn t worth the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Didn t work as advertised, there was no sound and it wouldn t record. Returned for refund.  [END]
[BEGIN] No memory card in packaging  [END]
[BEGIN] This lens hood does not fit well on Canon EFS 18-55 mm 3.5 -5.6 lens. Buyer beware.  [END]

[BEGIN] Broke the side door within 3min of opening the package.  [END]
[BEGIN] I did not buy this  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a very lousy product for the price. The image during the day is to overexposed when recording and the unit itself lasted about a week and a half before it died. For 140 dollars you can get yourself a way better camera than this marked up Chinese junk.  [END]
[BEGIN] Didn t work -_-  [END]
[BEGIN] it broke the first time I wanted to use it, bad quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] this is a fraud, doesn´t work, dont wast money buying this crap  [END]

[BEGIN] They simply don´t work. I want a refound. I already tried to do EVERYTHING to make them work, i tried in different areas with different internet conexion. The light always stay yellow and never changes to blue.  [END]
[BEGIN] I m very disappointed with this strap. It s super cute in the picture and looks long. I got it in the mail and extended it and the tiny black string is so small and is longer then the actual strap.  [END]
[BEGIN] Didn t work. Don t buy it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Don t buy unless you don t mind your SD cards falling out of the slots with the slightest jarring. This won t protect your cards as they get bounced around inside the case.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheap quality  [END]
[BEGIN] Inexpensive and the quality shows. I would not recommend this to a friend.  [END]
[BEGIN] very bad. I did not use it. the power is gone after a week.  [END]
[BEGIN] excellent product.  [END]
[BEGIN] We actually replaced the first one because it wouldn t update and when we received the second one it wouldn t update either!!  [END]

[BEGIN] junk customer service not patient on the phone for almost a hour after getting it up and going soon I hang up it stop working sent it back could not get it to work I m not even giving it one star sucks  [END]
[BEGIN] These batteries are not worth the price. After shooting about 24 pictures they are dead. I bought these to have extra batteries on an Alaskan cruise. Little did I know I would have been better off not purchasing these. Don t waste your money.  [END]
[BEGIN] not at all worth it. do not buy useless product. display quality is very poor  [END]
[BEGIN] Light is great but they did not ship everything that comes with the light. Missing a vital piece.  [END]
[BEGIN] The included mounting accessories do not fit the GoPro Hero 4 housing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not work  [END]
[BEGIN] this product does not work for the canon g12 camera  [END]
[BEGIN] Very disappointed with these filters. The threads do not seem to line up properly and they are difficult to get on and off. In fact, the uv filter actually fell off my camera as I was taking a picture over a cliff in Portugal!  [END]
[BEGIN] The cameras were not uniform, some were hard to wind and didn t indicate 0 pictures left. I was not happy with the quality of pictures.  [END]
[BEGIN] Well equip will put to use  [END]
[BEGIN] Most of these have had good reviews. I returned mine, it would not power on. I would have replaced it, but I found a less expensive one. (I am paying for that now)  [END]
[BEGIN] Looks fake and has to be eye leaves to work- we have it tilted up on a shelf but then it looks even faker. Very unhappy, especially for the price!!  [END]

[BEGIN] It s okay. Not very sturdy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Gopro did not work. Headband is of no use to me  [END]

[BEGIN] Not right one. I ordered EN-EL19  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything seems OK quality, but received a non-functioning 52mm adapter. Seems to be a 55mm adapter that came with it... How did that happen?  [END]
[BEGIN] doesn t fit the lens. I l have to return it  [END]
[BEGIN] Worthless. The 1st-time ring is not loud enough, and then from the 2nd-time on, it just makes a quite clicking sound that is hardly hearable as if it had not power- but it was directly connected to a power source. Wasted my money.  [END]
[BEGIN] The foscam app will not connect to any of my devices. have lost 90% of the use for this camera  [END]
[BEGIN] DO NOT BUY!!! Dropcam was great, Google cheapened and ruined it. Dropped resolution to 720, and the network drops off 8 or 10 times per day, even cust.. Support will tell you that nest(Google) ruined their company. Be fore warned, find a different camera!  [END]
[BEGIN] Setup way to complicated for the average user.  [END]
[BEGIN] This did not fit the battery to the camera I own even though the listing says it will.  [END]
[BEGIN] Thrs no intraction how to use it  [END]
[BEGIN] it dosent support P2P  [END]
[BEGIN] It didn t work  [END]

[BEGIN] worst flash i ever used , doesn t work with d7100 in wireless flash trigger mode and the quality of the light in hot shoe is too bad  [END]
[BEGIN] Didn t work consistently. Had to return. Thank you Amazon for a wonderful return policy!  [END]
[BEGIN] The selfie stick is cheap not worth it in my opinion. The other gadgets worked fine  [END]
[BEGIN] Stay away took 12 hours still won t able to fixed  [END]
[BEGIN] too small to use  [END]
[BEGIN] Soooo cheapy, we went to extend it and one of the poles came all the way off, one wouldn t open (stuck inside tube, tried to remove it with tweezers but it bent--- with tweezers!) very low quality, don t waste your money!  [END]
[BEGIN] Not suitable for a 6 individual. Sling strap when adjusted to max length is too short. Camera rides high (under your arm) and cannot be raised for shooting because of the short straps.  [END]
[BEGIN] vibrates way too much to use for camera  [END]
[BEGIN] Buy a go pro instead  [END]
[BEGIN] Not for original go pro  [END]
[BEGIN] really hard to get a signal. A waste of money  [END]
[BEGIN] These dont even hold a charge as lonh as my original 2yr old battery  [END]
[BEGIN] I only received two lens not three.  [END]
[BEGIN] lots of problems, wouldnt buy it again.  [END]
[BEGIN] You have to charge this thing everyday...complete waste of money. First item arrived damaged, return was easy but still not worth the money. Going to be putting into the trash. Only recordings I have gotten are when I first place it onto the wall.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sorry- had to return it. Much too small for a 50mm full frame lense.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not well ventilated.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does NOT do anything  [END]
[BEGIN] Suks  [END]
[BEGIN] Broken product was not what I expected to be  [END]

[BEGIN] I just got this product and it s not charging I m so disappointed hope will refund my money soon  [END]
[BEGIN] Shotty. Didn t work  [END]
[BEGIN] I used it less than five times decided just stop trying. It was so hard to figure out what I was hearing. I wish I used it sooner so I could get my money back. Don t waste your time and money on this device!  [END]
[BEGIN] I bought this as a combo for the infinity portable speaker and it didnt fit the damn thing  [END]
[BEGIN] This mic was the reason I kept getting error messages on my 70D. Didn t have time or patients to trouble shoot it. Sent it back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera stopped working within 30 days. It was a worst experience i had, i went for a trip with my family and thought to capture all the moments with this new camera but it stopped working all a sudden and i couldn t capture any pics of this trip.  [END]
[BEGIN] It did not accept the app, the disk would not load up.many trials and nothing.  [END]
[BEGIN] bad camera sent 2 back to aweek will not try that brand again  [END]
[BEGIN] Old model camera. The case is too small for the camera with battery. Except for the camera, nothing is of the brand or description advertised. I paid $90 for expedite but I was not shipped for 2 days and by Snail mail.  [END]
[BEGIN] More than half of the joints broke, all at different times. Only used once. It s hard to try to turn or twist. Not worth it on my book.  [END]
[BEGIN] Did not work!!  [END]
[BEGIN] The sd card would not play on my Galaxy phone, the info on it said it would.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have used this bag maybe five times and the zippers have failed. One zipper fell completely off and the other zipper popped out of the teeth; rendering the bag worthless. Look for another bag.  [END]
[BEGIN] Did not include the correct DVR.  [END]
[BEGIN] died after three months of use  [END]
[BEGIN] This tribrach has a iron items. I have been looked for tribrach with unmagnetic items and that it has items to brass or aluminium. Also screws are magnrtic item to iron.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the lenses was messed up and not clear, and the clip had chips in it. Disappointed  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked for about an hour, red light came on and that s it. Wouldn t reset, just a red &#34;I m dead&#34; light.  [END]
[BEGIN] Do not buy this camera. It failed me after two weeks of use! The lens mechanism stopped working and no longer extends out. You are better off using your mobile phone camera!  [END]
[BEGIN] It s Not sharp  [END]
[BEGIN] not at all what I thought it was. Returned  [END]
[BEGIN] Want to return but cannot and it does not work  [END]
[BEGIN] Arrived broken. They insisted I watch their video on proper way to use. I ve been using these for 30 years. Broken is broken. Very, very low quality product. Not one you can count on.  [END]
[BEGIN] the tow arms too short, the V-grove is too narrow, there is no way you can hang monitor and light and mike at the same time!  [END]
[BEGIN] Poor! It doesn t value the money that I have paid. The head of tripod doesn t screw the Gopro.  [END]
[BEGIN] These cameras are very buggy as they stop working all the time and have to unplug them the ptz doesn t as promised  [END]
[BEGIN] For a GoPro with accessories this case is not near big enough.  [END]

[BEGIN] It did not work for what it was supposed to work for, which was the sanza Clip  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible does not work I would like my money back please !  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing but problems from this thing. From freezing to not coming on at all. Doesn t even record you whole drive. Only records when it feels &#34;vibrations&#34;... Well the sensor must be poopoo! Do yourself a favor and stay away  [END]
[BEGIN] The product didn t even reach me.  [END]
[BEGIN] The battery lasted 6 weeks in a device designed to run for 5 years before replacing the battery. A bad product!  [END]
[BEGIN] This item clearly shows a 2nd part in the bike handle bar mount position photo. The description and images are misleading.  [END]
[BEGIN] The first day we used this product on set, 2 of three screws holding &#34;Sticks&#34; together came loose and we had to use gaffers tape to hold it together. I went to hardware store and replaced screws and it still falls apart. Do Not waste your time with this product!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very cheaply made, not intuitive at all. But the real reason for the one star is that after two months it stop working, now all the pictures look almost white, impossible to distinguish anything.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had to return as it would pair with my Blackberry Z10 but seemed to interrupt other functions on my phone and too hard to figure out for me - didn t have time to waste to figure it out. Time to change to another phone probably...  [END]
[BEGIN] Product does not work. I sent it back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Spend the extra money and get the brackets that are made out of metal, these are plastic and I had a brand new strobe hit the floor because of them. They just don t tighten down enough on the flash shoe to keep it from moving and sliding.  [END]
[BEGIN] the batteries do not hold a charge  [END]
[BEGIN] Canopy sent me a download that was illegible. I requested one in print someone could read. As of this date they have refused to send a legible copy, so I am cancelling the plan.  [END]
[BEGIN] They are a piece of s*** they re no good I m sorry to say that  [END]
[BEGIN] Absolute Junk. Could not get this camera to be recognized by the dlink software. Followed all instructions, tried both WPS and wired methods, tried both a desktop and a laptop.  [END]
[BEGIN] A real piece of junk, a waste of good money. Used it twice and the small metal connectors at the bottom that make contact with the battery broke, it s real garbage!  [END]
[BEGIN] Mine came broken I can t even use it because the metal part of the strap is broken  [END]
[BEGIN] Broke at application.  [END]
[BEGIN] this didn t work for me or my Nikon d5300. Of course I didn t try it right away so, I am beyond the 30 day return period. Charger indicates a full charge but when I put it in the camera, it is not charged.  [END]
[BEGIN] You need to hunt down required accesories and build this one yourself to get it to work - of you can find the right parts outside of London  [END]
[BEGIN] IT took OK pictures then died after 2 days. The camera would power up but crash when taking a photo.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was so excited when I got this cables. After 2 week of used the connection that screws into the camera broke. I am very disappointed.. please do yourself a favor and don t spend your hard working money on this crappy cables.  [END]
[BEGIN] This cameras are just poorly made. Either they reset, send me an email every minute or I cannot connect to them. Nothing but headaches. Thank god I only bought two. Don t waste your money on these.  [END]
[BEGIN] They send me defect one...I will never buy this again  [END]
[BEGIN] First time using this flash on my Nikon D3200 the flash was stuck on the hot shoe. Small ball bearing on bottom of flash would not retract all the way so it would not release the flash. Had to bring it in to have it removed. Poor quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not only was this NOT a plug & play device it is plastic cheap Xhina made. Even their Level 2 support cld not fix - wasted THREE HOURS! Returned & bought Nest (drop) cam which is AWESOME wyality & indeed installed instantly!!! Get a Nest cam!!!  [END]

[BEGIN] Its not good for my canon t3 after a couple of shots it tells me the communication between the lens in the body are not compatible I have to clean the connectors this lens is s*****  [END]
[BEGIN] The product is very low quality. It is cheaply made and does not work properly at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was working now it keeps disconnecting. I dont know whats going on  [END]
[BEGIN] Not ready for prime time. After countless hours with their support, we could not get it to work. Had no choice but to return it.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had to return it. Bad flash & one of the batteries were also bad. It was after 30 days & Amazon would not accept my return!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] CAN NOT fit my D750 as the title described!!!!! Please change the item title and the description!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] The camera is fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] The NVR is dead after 7 months. Front panel light are dark. Also ... The cameras require Microsoft Windows to configure. Cannot access without an unsecure and unsigned Active-x IE plugin. This system is useless to users with real computers. Linux users beware.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not working with Control4...  [END]
[BEGIN] Didn t work well broke, but I got what I paid for  [END]
[BEGIN] PIXDIGITAL is not an approved NIKON dealer (called 3rd Party by NIKON). Subsequently NIKON will not honor their warranty on the camera.  [END]

[BEGIN] So bad it s not worth a review.. useless junk.  [END]

[BEGIN] stopped working after a week  [END]
[BEGIN] This is not a UNIVERSAL AC ADAPTOR, it does not fit into my device  [END]
[BEGIN] Ok  [END]
[BEGIN] There are much more effective staff on the market. But I found how and where to apply it. Good for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] The gaps (in the way the cover closes) reflect on all of the photos.  [END]
[BEGIN] cannot connect as wireless unit have done everything - useless  [END]
[BEGIN] It blew..... amazon gave me a refund, also I would have given it 0 stars if I could  [END]

[BEGIN] camera would not work with my iphone ,appel 5s. The app kept dropping info and I had to re enter.  [END]
[BEGIN] worst product ever, no instuctions sent it back for full refund...still cost me $300.00 to find out it would not work I also sent message to amazon to let them know  [END]
[BEGIN] Would not take the information for the protection. How can you register your product if the website will not take the information. NOT GOOD! I feel like SmartGuard took my money - no coverage of product.  [END]
[BEGIN] Can t get it to work.went step by step.records nothing  [END]
[BEGIN] Far smaller than appears in photo  [END]

[BEGIN] It broke the first day i got it the foot crumbled now can t be used. Didn t even get to try it out very disappointing  [END]
[BEGIN] Crappy accessories.  [END]
[BEGIN] The blower was the only item that completely matched the description. Biggest letdown was receiving a cheap brush pen instead of a Lens Pen.  [END]
[BEGIN] It didn t come with all of the pieces to cover all the sides.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was cheaply made and tightening each leg as i lengthened it was a night mare. Didn t stay tight. The legs became loose and one of them broke. This was all within a month of getting it with minimal use.  [END]
[BEGIN] Poor quality product. Battery never charges, buttons work randomly and after 2 months of use the volume buttons stop functioning.  [END]
[BEGIN] No customer support ? Who is responsible here Agasio ? Foscam ? The support number dials Foscam and they say call Agasio ? Ridiculous Do not buy Agasio  [END]
[BEGIN] Charges battery but e charge on the camera runs out only after one hour of use!  [END]

[BEGIN] Out of the eight pictures taken, only 4 developed. I have never seen instant camera film this bad.  [END]
[BEGIN] Unit worked once then quit working. New egg and manufacturer FAILED TO refund or replace defective product after many requests. New egg passed responsibility to CHINA company who has not refunded for product. RIP OFFS  [END]
[BEGIN] The video not clear. The sound is bad and nosy. The detect move notification is late. It is really useless  [END]
[BEGIN] I m so unhappy , the mobile holder was broken as you can see in the photo  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible it didn t work at all, it didn t show any recording only lines across. Don t by it just try a different one.  [END]
[BEGIN] Unable to use the suction cup, I think it requires a housing for the gopro camera that snaps onto the suction cup and the same goes for the chest strap.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked ok but very disappointed that it did not come with the device.  [END]
[BEGIN] this does not work for a Canon 5d mark iii, they say it does but it doesnt. Will return.  [END]

[BEGIN] how do I return it Can t get it to work most of the time on my Samsung Galaxy S 4 I phone.  [END]
[BEGIN] too lightweight...not good at all  [END]
[BEGIN] I try this for my iPhone 6 Plus. The thing is top heavy and keep ripping over not matter how I adjust this thing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheap product, memory card inserted all the way into the camera instead of clicking into place. You can t record on a card that is floating around inside the camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have to revise my initial review. This product mostly worked as advertised for about a month, maybe less then suddenly stopped working. I emailed the seller for guidance with no luck. Be Wary  [END]

[BEGIN] its not working......  [END]
[BEGIN] Bad product that doesnt work at all  [END]
[BEGIN] Looks nothing like the picture on the box.Just clear through cheap plastic. Cant get the film roller to turn.Acts like it is locked into position. Then what could you expect for 10.00? Hopefully I can return it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Total junk. Needle was stuck from time took it out and would never move.  [END]
[BEGIN] I hate it. Not comfortable. Still slips down when you lift the camera up to take a picture. Tried it for a long time, now looking for something better.  [END]
[BEGIN] These cameras have very poor color rendition.  [END]
[BEGIN] The 3 second delay between detected motion and picture taken along with poor focus gave no useful pictures.  [END]

[BEGIN] Didn t work at all!  [END]
[BEGIN] Like the idea it seems to work but there is no way to play SD card on your computer you have to use the dvr I thought you would be able to emailed several time hard to get point across its sitting in a box  [END]
[BEGIN] Took it and phone to shop and they couldn t get anything out of even after hours of trying to charge it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Absolute piece of crap. After the update it won t work anymore. Hugely disappointed! DO NOT BUY! There is no way to contact the manufacturer for a replacement or anything. It s a rip off. Amazon needs to step in and stop these douchebags from selling here.  [END]
[BEGIN] taped thru the middle all the way across. folded like an accordion so folds won t come out..can t use as a background.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was looking forward to receiving these but I was disappointed. They were already broken before I could put them on. One of the arms was in a few pieces I will probably use the parts to make something different.  [END]
[BEGIN] Doesn t work outside USA  [END]
[BEGIN] The sticker did not fit and fell off right away. Terrible item. Waste of money.  [END]
[BEGIN] What can I say....it broke 3 minutes into my ride. It was lose so I gave it another turn and it fell apart. Plastic junk.  [END]
[BEGIN] Flash will not work anymore. Only 1 day after purchase. This thing is bad!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] It was nice  [END]
[BEGIN] It doesn t zoom well  [END]
[BEGIN] I ONLY GOT ONE SET, NOT TWO! SO this was a JOKE of a product!  [END]
[BEGIN] This item ripped in several places on the first use. The quality was horrible.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bad product and bad documentation, it has issues to function. It is surprisingly that a leader brand like Nikon develops a product like this. Another story is the software which is realy poor. I don t recommend it  [END]
[BEGIN] Not up to the expectation. Would recommend Nikon COOLPIX S5300 instead of this model.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does not make a smooth uninterrupted scan no matter how fast, slow or careful you are with it. You get what you are willing to pay for it, I guess.  [END]
[BEGIN] The usb charging port already broke.  [END]
[BEGIN] I couldn t get this harness to fit at all. I m female 5 5&#34;. When I adjusted it to the correct length I was unable to raise my binoculars to my eyes.Definately not a product that will work for everyone. Returned without any problems.  [END]
[BEGIN] Broke right out of the box.  [END]
[BEGIN] Garbage, does not work!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked fine when I first got it, and now a few months later, I go to record and nothing. No sound.  [END]
[BEGIN] I wanted extra batteries for an upcoming research trip to Mongolia. Sadly, this held an incredibly low charge and was next to useless. Very disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] I got this because I m a bit p-noid sometimes...this only made it worse!! I get it and test it out, the signal was going off every where, my tv, my ceiling fan, my cable box and spots in my ceiling I which is probably an electric junction box.  [END]
[BEGIN] This item is really unattractive and not functional. Also they charged me $7 to return it??? Terrible. DO NOT BUY!  [END]
[BEGIN] This hood is not worth ordering. It does not securely mount onto my Canon lens, and has fallen off more than a few times. It is only a matter of time before I loose it for good (which at this point I am okay with).  [END]
[BEGIN] good  [END]
[BEGIN] When I attached it to my camera it wouldn t focus at all  [END]
[BEGIN] i think maybe they lit for one night, then dead, nothing. get them at Home Depot instead. I should of.  [END]
[BEGIN] As soon as I put my flash, the clamp would fall and lost it grip. Not worth the price  [END]
[BEGIN] Sucks... i need a serial code that they were supposed to give me to use the software so i can t use it until I get it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great idea, worked great for about a month then started having all kinds of problems. Would like to see someone build a more durable and reliable unit and charge more for it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Too small to comfortably hold Coolpix S33.  [END]
[BEGIN] No windows 8 drivers, not compatible  [END]
[BEGIN] Does not fit the Canon EFS 18-55 IS. The lens has 3 tabs, the hood only has 2. Returning to Amazon. I don t know how the people that answered questions got it to fit unless they have a different version of the 18-55 from Canon.  [END]
[BEGIN] too dificult to operate  [END]
[BEGIN] Nope didnt like it  [END]
[BEGIN] My order was for 5 cameras- 3 of them arrived broken beyond repair. Of the 5, zero of them have a functioning light. They are passable as cameras but your odds are low that they ll arrive in usable condition.  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible super cheap made! They should not be selling this item it all I give it zero stars!! Please don t buy this item you will be very disappointed! I promise!  [END]
[BEGIN] It did not work. The screen was completely white.  [END]
[BEGIN] My bouancy mount just crumbled in my hands after less than a month of light use. What gives? This is after the screw for one of the mounts disappearing in the ocean. I m dumbfounded.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wonderful toy, if it just worked how it supposed to. It doesn t matter how much i correct or &#34;calibrate&#34; it with the correction buttons in the remote, it just keep going front or aside, i almost lost it to the ocean 2 times!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Not sure have not got it to work yet. I will repost later.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not made strong  [END]
[BEGIN] Was good till it rained. Camera maybe outdoor but not the poe connection.  [END]
[BEGIN] AWFUL! Save your money. The software wouldn t download, making it completely useless.  [END]
[BEGIN] My camera stopped working the minute I plugged this in!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] not good at all  [END]
[BEGIN] The fit is so far off the batter fails to make contact when this device is screwed onto the A6000  [END]
[BEGIN] Both units arrived DOA. No functions worked, not even flash test. Tried several Nikon flashes - all the same. Best thinks I can say is that I got a prompt no hassle refund.  [END]
[BEGIN] This does not fit a Nikon P500 even though it s listed.  [END]
[BEGIN] does not contain the circlip, not be able to repair ,the image does not correspond to the product  [END]
[BEGIN] It was a plastic globe with purposely large drilled holes all around the base of it but packaged in a profoto box. Didn t seem legit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not good at all! Never had Wi-Fi , you suck!  [END]
[BEGIN] This product freaking sucks! We have now had it for two and a half months, and it just QUIT WORKING! And Amazon won t let me return it, I am pissed!  [END]
[BEGIN] Poor connection that requires the camera to be turned on before the lens is seated. This is too expensive for the build quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] Battery would hold enough charge to power the camera for 3 minutes. From first charge, this new battery would not hold a charge. Warning! Avoid! Pour quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] Junk! waste of time and money! Don t buy it!  [END]
[BEGIN] bad  [END]
[BEGIN] I purchased the older model a few years back and it worked great! The new model works but is fuzzy and hangs on shutdown! I would not recommend. Instead of getting better it is far worse! If you can get dvu104 it works very well!  [END]
[BEGIN] Other than it breaking 2 days after getting it, it s great. I wish I could leave negative stars. Biggest piece of crap. Poorly made.  [END]
[BEGIN] I got the incorrect brand for my camera, loot at the details first before you purchase it.  [END]
[BEGIN] I wouldn t recommend buying this, the tripod is plastic, and one of the legs broke! Not very sturdy and it came to me all scratched up and rusty!  [END]
[BEGIN] Didn t fit. Didn t work. Didn t charge.  [END]
[BEGIN] Then Vivitar Auto Focus teleconverter lens would not operate on auto focus. I had to manually focus to obtain an image. I m very displeased with this purchase and when I return home later this week I will be requesting another one that works.  [END]
[BEGIN] The product do not work well. First the stop sign I thought would have been a little bigger. And it want light up when the car touch the pole. It will light up way seconds later. I really not satisfied with the product.  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible. I didnt even get a chance to get it wet. Thr screen stopped working and the battery died within 15 minutes. Now i have no pics of my event  [END]
[BEGIN] It was weak and break easy  [END]
[BEGIN] Was NOT the color I ordered. I wanted raspberry, received a very dull, red camera instead. Very disappointed  [END]
[BEGIN] Didn t fit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Its advertised as new, the product is not and wont hold charge  [END]
[BEGIN] Doesn t fit any canons  [END]
[BEGIN] The documentation is in unintelligible English. Product support is non-existent. Returned.  [END]
[BEGIN] BUYER BEWARE... Both zipper pulls from main compartment broke off in less than 3 months... the shoulder strap also broke in half. This case have only been used lightly since I bought it... I guess you get what you pay for.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hight of the mount slide was too shallow for my GoPro Hero 3 clip and I could not insert the clip. Nice try but useless.  [END]
[BEGIN] Monitor had to be sent back to uniden for repair 1week after installation!!! Very disappointed and inconvenienced! Still haven t heard back from manufacturer!  [END]
[BEGIN] I expected this pencil to be able to mark the back of photos. It does not. Was I incorrect in my expectation?  [END]
[BEGIN] Super cheap plastic. Horrible video quality. Wasn t worth the $26 amazon prime day special. Returned it.  [END]
[BEGIN] The camera never worked and a child was very dissappointed. Do not buy this camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very bad product. It show no value for money  [END]
[BEGIN] The one thing I slider is supposed to do is move left to right smoothly. Not only are there a lot of kinks in the move, it also wobbles forward and backwards along the track.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bought two. Each charged in less than 2 hours with Canon charger, but both were depleted of charge in 2 days. One with no use and the other used to take only 2 photographs. My rating would be a minus 5 stars.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not was explained.. Wasted money!  [END]
[BEGIN] Extremely upset! Wish i could give it zero stars. I did not receive what was pictured. It was suppose to be film with rainbow borders instead they all have white borders. Will be returning.  [END]
[BEGIN] it is not charging anymore!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Half didn t work  [END]
[BEGIN] Bought this less than 6 months ago and barely made use of it but one of the batteries is a dud already. Disappointed!  [END]
[BEGIN] didn t fit my gh1  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera is sold by Vivitar as &#34;underwater&#34; witha picture of a diver on the front of the box, yet on further review of the fine print, is only &#34;water resistant to 10 feet&#34;. This is a gross misrepresentation. Buy a go pro or another cheaper camera that is truley waterproof.  [END]
[BEGIN] Detail of material  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible, terrible , terrible!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Wrong Key code on the software disk. Software will not load.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does not fit my sb400  [END]
[BEGIN] Looks like a good quality product, but unfortunately it doesn t fit my gopro as advertised. I have a gopro hero 3. This skeleton housing is slightly too big for the houaing my gooro came with. Too bad.  [END]
[BEGIN] Did not like this item the lights are not bright enough to light the background properly for a good photo. I ve tried everything with this box and my photos do not come out nearly as well as my last box ( different brand).  [END]
[BEGIN] terrible quality, the camera is way to small, it is plastic witch makes it eel like youre using a toy, it sucks  [END]
[BEGIN] returned it ---not good  [END]
[BEGIN] adequate for the task at hand.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does not work at all. Does not hold a charge for the camera. Basically I bought a $50 wall clock  [END]
[BEGIN] Bags are really loose, neoprene is really thin, won t protect your lenses!  [END]
[BEGIN] FLIMSEY, CANNOT OPEN THE BACK. DON T BUY IT.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is so thin. I thought it would be thicker and not look like a piece of cheap cloth.  [END]
[BEGIN] It would not open on Mac  [END]
[BEGIN] Does not bring any SD card 6 feet of cable what is that good for you would need an outlet on every camera very very poor quality video super super cheap quality!!!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Garbage product. Broke before I could install it. Again, IT BROKE BEFORE IT WAS USED. That s a little problematic. Don t waste your money. Buy the Canon version. Mine Canon cable is still going strong 6+ years after its purchase.  [END]
[BEGIN] It does a very bad job of zoom. The zoom feature was why I purchased the camera and if you use the zoom the pics are blurry. I am very disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Volume down button didn t work. I got s replacement and the same thing was wrong with the replacement. I ended up returning both and got a different camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] I ordered. I charged. It just did not work. So, I returned...  [END]
[BEGIN] 👎  [END]
[BEGIN] back door does not fit Hero 3. it is too large.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does not fit well. Keeps slipping of the Canon lens it was built for. Don t waste your money on this piece of poorly made plastic. You should expect more from the lensmaker  [END]
[BEGIN] Flash does not work as advertised. It will not work wirelessly. I contacted the seller for help, but never heard back from them.  [END]
[BEGIN] it does not fit my camera like it was advertised!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I want my money back, not worth the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] The belt loop breaks fast.  [END]
[BEGIN] Plugged in just as instruction said. About a minute after taking of lost all power and copter board caught on fire. Been flying for a year with no problems until I attached the camera  [END]
[BEGIN] TERRIBLE, I bought this when i was at the beach. Then took it into the water and it was suppose to be so called &#34;waterproof&#34;. It wasn t and rusted then I was going to use it again and the pole popped right off and bent.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bough in November, 2014. After July, 2015, they charge about 2 hours of use (one bar). Enveloping plastic detaches from edge, which makes difficult to get battery out of camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] This item was not working well.... Turned on the camera and I got pictured.. But the picture was blur like smudge ..... Not in good condition...  [END]
[BEGIN] Screen was completely backwards (clock, etc.) Sent it back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Junk, send it back to China  [END]
[BEGIN] The tripod is not stable. When I attached the selfie stick to the tripod, it tilted over and dropped. I would not recommend this product if you are looking for a tripod to hold the selfie stick for pictures and recording.  [END]
[BEGIN] it is the fourth one I have purchased hoping it would work. its a hit and miss (with most MISS) also if I am lucky it records but can t play it on any of my computers  [END]
[BEGIN] Charged this battery upon arrival. Camera ran less than one minute and died. Not pleased at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] not part what I needed  [END]
[BEGIN] This is NOT a 500 watt light. It is 75 watts, equivalent to a 300 watt incandescent bulb.  [END]
[BEGIN] These binoculars were too big for my use  [END]
[BEGIN] It was cracked. I took it into the water and it started to flood. Luckily I noticed it before it killed my go pro  [END]
[BEGIN] Never worked with iPhone. Now in junk drawer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Was not for your shoulder like it says and it is very short even for around your neck  [END]
[BEGIN] Broke the first day.....  [END]
[BEGIN] Didn t like this. The case was too small for the GAlaxy2 camera and would sometimes turn the power on as you slid it into the case. May be ok for a smaller device.  [END]
[BEGIN] Optic tubes were not aligned. Two discrete images with an angular separation both horizontally and vertically. This should have been discovered before shipping by simple inspection. Did not re-order.  [END]
[BEGIN] Crazy number of tiny parts to assemble and instructions were worthless.  [END]
[BEGIN] the film we got was outdated in 2008 pleas give me my money back  [END]
[BEGIN] Total FAIL. Camera mount completely came apart and we lost our camera in the waves. Do NOT buy if you care about your camera  [END]
[BEGIN] -0 star junk THE END  [END]
[BEGIN] This is NOT plug/play. It is plug/install an executable from china/play. It requires flash which is on it s last leg as software. This does not work with Blue Iris software. You cannot play the video without installing their software.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very cheaply made, and cannot even figure out how to use it (no, it isn t simple at all -- actually has two pieces. Huh? Just another lesson in purchasing on the cheap.  [END]
[BEGIN] I did not receive the product shown in the pictures. Very dissatisfied right now  [END]
[BEGIN] DON T WASTE YOUR TIME BUYING THIS! NO INSTRUCTIONS AND ALL THE PARTS WEREN T INCLUDED.  [END]
[BEGIN] broke after about 6 months. I used it about 3 times within those 6 months :(  [END]
[BEGIN] I live in a very hot area, the glue loosens from the back and the adapter (and the attached lenses/filters) falls off of the camera... what a waste of money, useless  [END]
[BEGIN] pictures are so tiny you can t see it clearly,so I ll return it  [END]
[BEGIN] Battery did not hold a charge, was unchargable so I returned it for a refund  [END]
[BEGIN] It is a big disappointment,it worked just during installation with good audio and Vedic but late the audio turned to one way traffic. The outdoor will hear you but you can t hear from indoor. It is a wast of money.Video picture is great and clear.This product needs improvements.  [END]
[BEGIN] Too small and rip apart too easily  [END]
[BEGIN] Impossible to set up. Do not waste your time.  [END]
[BEGIN] The lens hood interferes with the camera lens by obtrusively vignetting the view and thus the photos. I can t think of any situation in which I would find this product of any value.  [END]
[BEGIN] Mine didn t work. I feel like these were overstocks with batteries long dead. No amount of charging time made any difference. On the plus side, Amazon refunded my money promptly  [END]
[BEGIN] it did not look like what picture shows , in the picture it has the thing for attach to tripot but one I received dose not has one you need to change the picture or send same thing as picture shows  [END]
[BEGIN] The Camera works fine. However, Fuji download software is out of date and I cannot download pictures to my windows 10 software on my computer. I have contacted Fuji about this matter  [END]
[BEGIN] The s mirrors are useless. They constantly move even though I strapped them very tight to the handlebar and also tightened the small bolt that holds the unit together.  [END]
[BEGIN] i was really excited to use this, but it came broken. I changed the batteries three times and nothing.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have a Nikon 5300 and this doesn t come close to fitting. Pretty disappointing.  [END]
[BEGIN] One attachment worked. Nine wouldn t attach to the GoPro because the slots didn t line up. I must have gotten a bad batch.  [END]
[BEGIN] I received the camera and didn t open right away cause it was a gift. When it was opened it didn t work. Still haven t heard back from them.  [END]
[BEGIN] DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE.  [END]
[BEGIN] don t really stay on the visor, depends how thick your visor is... not working on mine.  [END]
[BEGIN] Package was received opened and reclosed and without the product.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had to return it 2x for the same problem over the span of 3 days, unreliable.  [END]
[BEGIN] poor quality it SUCKS!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] mine will not charge any of my 3 batteries. they fit fine in the charging port but they will not charge and no light comes on. what do i do.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does not load photos  [END]
[BEGIN] defective out of the box. the part that attaches to the camera was not assembled properly and didn t align on the camera. had to return so don t know if anything else about it  [END]
[BEGIN] Sorry to say mine didn t work properly. Only one side work. And there is a loud popping static sound on the other side. Maybe somebody else will have better luck but mine was a malfunction I guess.  [END]
[BEGIN] The white trash and ghetto thugs living around me think they are real and that s good enough for me. Combine these with Mr Beams motion sensor lights and you ll be making those unsightly neighbors very uncomfortable and compliant in no time  [END]
[BEGIN] I could not connect to the camera. LAN cable to the camera and the PoE power supply then to the router. The light on camera came on but kept getting Log In Failure using the supplied Configure Setup software. Returned the camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] Return it  [END]
[BEGIN] didn t work  [END]
[BEGIN] I just got this today and it is already packaged to be returned. Apart from being junk, the battery was corroded and the film was dated 2002. What???? Save some money and buy a disposable camera, they will work much better. If I could give it zero stars I would.  [END]
[BEGIN] They were the worse thing I ever bought  [END]
[BEGIN] too soft  [END]
[BEGIN] VERY CHEAP MATERIAL ... BATTERIES RUN LOW FAST. NOT WORTH IT. .. LOOKS FAKE ANYWAYS  [END]
[BEGIN] Won t stay on! Keeps falling off! Crappy product!  [END]
[BEGIN] It was broken when I received it .so I didn t get a chance to use it  [END]
[BEGIN] Very cheaply made.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very poor quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent! I loved and it worked very well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Useless commodity. Neither battery was chargeable. It s not worth processing for a refund.  [END]
[BEGIN] The soil is used contaminated a whole bunch of stuff, send me them! I got really upset.  [END]
[BEGIN] The camera was not what I thought it would be so the this protection plan was a waste of my money since I do not even use this camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had to return the main product these accessories, and this seller did not take these back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Videos come in hkv format. Have to watch full video can t skip thru.  [END]
[BEGIN] I afraid that I bought it so much big to my lens..I mean I didn t read in the product details about the filter size&#62; I use a Nikon and those filter don t fit an any lens that I have....Bad purchase.  [END]
[BEGIN] Doesn t work and got no refund. Stay away  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera fogged in side camera lens during first use.  [END]
[BEGIN] I bought this with the expectation that I am able to pan my camera for panoramic pictures. The problem is when the ball is locked into place, it also locks the panning mechanism below! You can t rotate the damn thing. Stupid design.  [END]
[BEGIN] Right out of the box, the owner s manual is missing. I m thinking this is a return. I will charge the battery, go online to look for a manual, but if the camera doesn t work, I want a full refund. I m very upset.  [END]
[BEGIN] No, it does not meet my expectations. I need to return.  [END]
[BEGIN] Showed up only one side charges.  [END]
[BEGIN] Did not have a universal fit like it describes. My Cool pics and Easyshare didn t fit. I returned for my money.  [END]
[BEGIN] Smudge on the lens that I couldn t get off. Took a few pictures...all blurred.  [END]
[BEGIN] Received and it was broken  [END]
[BEGIN] Does not fit my factory Gopro case or the aftermarket case i purchased. totally useless junk.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s not good :( I m not happy i open it it s toooooo small not great quality recording and pictures are worse i don t know how to get a refund but I wish I could :(  [END]
[BEGIN] I wouldn t recommend. It definitely doesn t work for what I want. EXTREMELY limited focus. You truly get what you pay for. The only upside, packaging was great and it did arrive quickly.  [END]
[BEGIN] I thought I was getting a good deal for B+W 72mm UV filter but when it arrived, it was a used one. It had finger prints and a dry sugary substance (ad if someone spilled soda on it) very disappointed. Going to stick with purchasing my filters from B&H Photo  [END]
[BEGIN] When turn on camera need to pull battery out and back in for camera to work  [END]
[BEGIN] This tripod is not up to my expectations too short and unstable but for the money I guess it s all right  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible product. Worked only 3 times and never again. Do not waste your money in this crap  [END]
[BEGIN] I got the accessories yesterday, when I open it, there is no connection with the selfie stick, I cannot use it for connecting with waterproof case.  [END]
[BEGIN] Doesn t even deserved 1 star.... Terrible, horrible, stupid app that will never connect to WIFI even when completing all steps multiple times your camera will appear offline on the app while the connection light is green. Without the app working this camera is useless... Never again....  [END]
[BEGIN] The product came with the brand name &#34;Camson&#34; written in front, it was not in the sample photos, I do not like how it looks.  [END]
[BEGIN] Case leaked while in Florida.  [END]
[BEGIN] Do not waste your money-broke almost immediately on landing after third day flying. I would say I am a medium level drone operator and this product was poor. I own 5 drones, so take it from me, not worth the savings.  [END]
[BEGIN] Poorly written instructions and doesn t work as advertised.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheaply made and put together! The pieces of it don t even fit together so the led light emits from EVERYWHERE drawing attention to it and even annoying the wearer in darker environments. Stay away!  [END]
[BEGIN] poor colors, al photos have a green screen with this papers… bad choice  [END]
[BEGIN] Umbrella hole is too small for my 43&#34; Westcott Umbrella.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s basically impossible to make this camera/feed work consistently. It is unbelievably frustrating and a waste of money.  [END]
[BEGIN] This watch is supposed to be water resistant but water got into watch after a few months of use, now it s filled with water and not usable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheap - Don t buy this!  [END]
