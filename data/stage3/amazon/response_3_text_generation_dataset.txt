[BEGIN] This item worked as expected, and was great for the simple task of keeping an eye on my drive way.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bag is very nice quality. Beware of how small it is though, I end up have to return this!  [END]
[BEGIN] A bit bulky, but it held my brother s camera above water when dropped it in the ocean on accident!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice bag overall. One of the side buttons was broken.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great backdrop. Does have folds but I believe those will go away over time. Great product for the price!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great with smartthings... Wish it was a little smaller.  [END]
[BEGIN] rec d as promised and as advertised  [END]
[BEGIN] Got this camera at a great discounted price and am very happy with it excellent night vision, very easy to set up for use with ipad.  [END]
[BEGIN] a great little case to carry your Coolpix Camera around with you in the car or anywhere s. it protects it from damage that could happen if you just carried it everywhere without this case. Has a strap to carry it by too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just enough there so I don t drop the camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] Exactly as expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s ok  [END]
[BEGIN] They are a little different from my original battery but them make good back up batteries.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product for the price  [END]
[BEGIN] Work great. Nice and bright.  [END]
[BEGIN] This one is much better for someone with smaller wrist because this is some what adjustable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Package came on time and works fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] like camera a lot  [END]
[BEGIN] Good quality, covers all the basics. Very happy with the items  [END]
[BEGIN] Easy to use; load, unload, operate and keep dry.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this camera. Great to emsil photos directly from the camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] So far, so good compared to my carbon fiber props  [END]
[BEGIN] It s a nice strap, well made, strong, and comfortable, and it looks good too. I like the length of the strap but just me personally. I m sure an adjustable version of this strap will fit more people s needs.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works OK  [END]
[BEGIN] Allowed me to go from 52mm to 77 on Canon Lenses.  [END]
[BEGIN] Water got inside and I haven t been able to get it out. Other than that it s as advertised, floats well, would recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is really nice for small spaces inside for bouncing the light (instead of using a card to bounce off of). I ve since purchased a separate flash, but will keep this as a backup!  [END]
[BEGIN] Touch screen sensitivity not as good as a smart phone. Worsens when screen protector film is applied.  [END]
[BEGIN] GREAT DEAL OVER ALL FOR THE PRICE. WOULD HAVE LIKE IT MORE IF THE PACKAGE CAME WITH MORE DETAIL ON LENS USEAGE  [END]
[BEGIN] awesome fluid head! bought it along with a K2 Slider, very sturdy and solid build! Super smooth pan and Tilt!  [END]
[BEGIN] a little flimsy, but works for my purposes  [END]
[BEGIN] So far i like it but am still learning all the different things it can do. the instruction guide is sadly lacking so I am using the hit and miss method. It does take excellent pictures  [END]
[BEGIN] Really easy to use, light weight, and it helps you adjust the exposure which is great. Only downside is you use film up quickly so it s a good idea to stock up good thing the film is relatively cheap. Overall happy with my purchase  [END]
[BEGIN] This is an excellent set and delivers excellent quality photos and video. I also have a Sony A-58, and while I m not sure that this camera does a better job, can say that both are very good for the money.  [END]
[BEGIN] nice item need spares........  [END]
[BEGIN] I am pleased with the product thus far - the field of view seems pretty good. Vincent was great with helping me set this up on my wifi network.  [END]
[BEGIN] Suitable for EOS M with 22 mm lens. Beware, it would not fit if you have a lens hood.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tripod is crap, others fine  [END]
[BEGIN] Seems to charge drained battery fairly rapidly. Car charger a nice touch.  [END]
[BEGIN] So far everything works fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] Iphone 6 plus with a case is hard to fit and stay.  [END]
[BEGIN] fit GoPro wonderfuly and fit nicely into the flash hot shoe  [END]
[BEGIN] Great deal on a terrific flash.  [END]
[BEGIN] The camera nice zoom great but cant get it to hook to wifi call and email kodak with no response i have other kodaks love them very dissapointed in the company lack of customer services  [END]
[BEGIN] This is loud, but not incredibly loud. If you are in the same room it is loud. But we have ours downstairs and i am not sure it would wake us up if we were sleeping. The long cord on the ac adaptor is a nice feature  [END]
[BEGIN] Works very well. Only reason for the 4 stars, is that the dimensions are not perfect on it. One side is shorter in width then the other. Luckily the material stretches so I was able to make up the difference.  [END]
[BEGIN] For some reason, this lens capp was very awkward to take off. I am hoping it will loosen and become easier to on-off the lens.  [END]
[BEGIN] great quality for the price. I gave it four stars because there is quite a bit of electronic feedback in the audio.  [END]
[BEGIN] This product was bought as a gift. Their overall rating was a four out five.  [END]
[BEGIN] All items included as described. Seems to be a good starter pack.  [END]
[BEGIN] Easy to set up and use via phone apps. Cannot zoom in browser app. 2-way audio and night vision work well. HD feed is nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great camera for the price. Now I can watch what my dog is doing when I m not home.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the lids, but the accompanying literature is a little thin in substance.  [END]
[BEGIN] Came quickly. Was exactly as expected. Thank you.  [END]
[BEGIN] Like it  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice  [END]
[BEGIN] She loved it!  [END]
[BEGIN] ok  [END]
[BEGIN] Good product. Fits in the frame differently than the real GoPro &#34;Frame&#34;. Still works as designed with access to the buttons.  [END]
[BEGIN] This camera is great for the price. It is difficult to set up, but the customer service is very helpful!  [END]
[BEGIN] Not the best glass in the world but the closeup lenses do their job adequately. To the naked eye, the lenses do mot appear to be coated although Hoya claims otherwise. I recommend this product.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good camera. Just wish it would zoom out to a wider field of vision.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great camera. Best in class for the price - although I bought my body eight months ago at $550 and now a kit is $499 - I feel ripped off.  [END]
[BEGIN] Grandson was very happy with the stand  [END]
[BEGIN] This battery works well lasting two hours of non-stop time lapse.  [END]
[BEGIN] Try to measure the LCD first before you buy any.  [END]
[BEGIN] Gave me the confidence that our new underwater camera would not be lost while snorkeling.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rock solid but HEAVY. I m 6 1&#34; and can comfortably take photos without extending the center column - I only have to lean a little. With the column fully extended, the camera platform is at forehead height  [END]
[BEGIN] I install cameras for a living and this is the best camera for the money I have seen so far. The price point is incredibly low for good quality and a respectable assortment of features.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just as described online. Good buy  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent for leveling a tripod. Would be great if they provided instructions on installation.  [END]
[BEGIN] Thanks  [END]
[BEGIN] works as expected  [END]
[BEGIN] Flys very well. Arrived on time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works as advertised. Carries good amount of photo equipment - like the removable padded &#34;box&#34; that allows the backpack to convert to just a backpack if needed, and the zippered access from the back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just as I expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] Unfortunately, I m still trying to play with the camera. It s very simple to use but I have not made the time to do so. The price is right. Have fun with it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fine product, not sure how good this glass is but it works and my pics look a lot crispier and warm and I get to show the awesome blue Florida and Puerto Rican skies and puffy clouds.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great  [END]
[BEGIN] The video quality is great. The use of the microphone could be better. It doesn t always work.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great with my Peak Design camera mount.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well, good quality but hard to avoid having bubbles.  [END]
[BEGIN] Though we have not used this article, it looks like good quality and was delivered on time. It is what we were looking for. We look forward to using it on a beach trip this month  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well, but the clip is about 3mm short of centering the lens on the HTC One M8.  [END]
[BEGIN] so far so good. sometimes it turns on by itself when it s in my purse - but i put it in a sun glass case to make sure the button doesn t push down accidentally.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great reference quick easy and easy to understand  [END]
[BEGIN] This works as advertised and has held up well in both the sun and rain.  [END]
[BEGIN] Unit works fine. Instruction manual almost impossible to understand.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice case however it needs to be wrapped around a fairly beefy belt/strap for the loop on the back to really hold it in place  [END]
[BEGIN] It works well for protecting the lens while not affecting the quality of the pics on my Sony Action camera. I just wish it was more simple to put on the camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] The color s beautiful and it s holding up really well so far. I do wish the faux-leather pieces were thicker. Just looks a little flimsy and doesnt hold the pattern as well as advertised.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works good with all the working parts  [END]
[BEGIN] I had been wanting to try one for awhile. It was easy to figure out how to use. A little cord plugs into the auxiliary jack and then the handle extends. Takes good pictures! Works as promised.  [END]
[BEGIN] Plastic, but functional and will allow SONY product to use GO PRO Accessories. Price is very reasonable. Came direct from China, so a bit slower on delivery than other products ordered same date.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s a good kit; however, the SM card is not compatible with the GE DVX1080 P pocket video camera  [END]
[BEGIN] Absolutely no instruction on how to attach this mini soft box. After a few minutes of cursing the companies name, it dawned on me. Works very well.  [END]
[BEGIN] I purchased tve as backups yo my original.  [END]
[BEGIN] This camera is easy to set up. It works great as described.  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean clear picture, works great!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product!  [END]
[BEGIN] Fast delivery very nicely packaged! Impressed with how fast it charged up..very neat lil camera looking forward to recording video on motorcycle trips!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good product  [END]
[BEGIN] Great  [END]
[BEGIN] Very versatile lens. Perfect for travelling. You don t have to carry different lenses because the range of this lens is excellent. It could be a little faster (e.g. f2.0), but then the price would go up substantially. Works very well with Canon 60D.  [END]
[BEGIN] Satisfied with this purchase, camera works fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] great camera, now I want the newest version  [END]
[BEGIN] hopefully I will not have to use this, but I feel safe having it..Thanks  [END]
[BEGIN] Haven t tried everything yet, but good so far  [END]
[BEGIN] ok  [END]
[BEGIN] I used it on my astro master 70 and I was very impressed on how simple and fast I could see through it,,although I had to use with it the adapter that comes with my telescope so I can mount it on  [END]
[BEGIN] Purchased it for my 13 year old daughter. She really likes it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works as intended, feels sturdy. Didn t end up working for me...sigh.  [END]
[BEGIN] You have to go online to get directions on using the camera. I m still learning all the in s and out s but the camera is a good one. And you can use a regular SD card in it, so that s good.  [END]
[BEGIN] works great  [END]
[BEGIN] great quality  [END]
[BEGIN] This case fits my Canon EOS Rebel SL1 with 18-55mm lens perfectly. The only shortcoming is that there is scant space for accessories. I can put two spare batteries in the front pocket but there is no place for a filter.  [END]
[BEGIN] I really liked this but I never got all the bubbles out.  [END]
[BEGIN] The screen can crack easily, but it definitely works under water. Took mine to some whale shark dives; very pleased. My pictures were definitely better than the rentals the resort offered for underwater photography.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great and strud for a DSLR, but the knobs/caps get loose over time.  [END]
[BEGIN] good  [END]
[BEGIN] As described except one of the light bulbs which was included was burned out.  [END]
[BEGIN] The ad needs to state that the batteries are not included but great product great price  [END]
[BEGIN] Only complaint I have is that they re a bit difficult to put into the binoc mounts. Also, they could be a bit longer to make it easier to clip on the strap.  [END]
[BEGIN] In terms of the quality of the product - it is exceptional and by far has the best image quality Sound was good as well  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice battery. Holds a very good charge.  [END]
[BEGIN] Have been charged several times due to vacation and birthdays. Have held a good charge and long use of each battery. Will buy more before the Holidays.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s a little small. But that s just me. This is probably more intended for essential gear you need to take with you.  [END]
[BEGIN] the camera seems good but some of the accessories parts missing and not compatable. The camera is top heavy on the tripod. It tilts down no matter how much it is tighten. There was buckle missing on hand held grip. do I have any recourse?  [END]
[BEGIN] A great buy. Cheap bag  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a good grip for medium weight cameras but if u run lots of add ons like light mic and monitor the weight can be thrown off a bit but all the extra thread points make it great for multiple uses  [END]
[BEGIN] dose the 55-300 Nikon have a plastic or is it a stainless mount?  [END]
[BEGIN] Works perfectly with my Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX50 16.2 MP Digital Camera. This case is a little bulkier than I really wanted, but it has worked out well with the attached belt loop on the back.  [END]
[BEGIN] decent batteries, a lot cheaper than buying canon. only thing I have noticed is they don t last as long as the canon. At this price I will buy more for backups.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good product, a little pricey.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bought this as a gift for my stepson and it performed great in the water. Solid quality and build. Image quality also excellent.  [END]
[BEGIN] its pretty hard to attach my go pro as the screw is to close to the housing, but overall great product.  [END]
[BEGIN] as described fast shipping highly recommend  [END]
[BEGIN] Just big enough stretch to fit iPhone 6Plus with Spiegen Tough Armour  [END]
[BEGIN] Configuration is somewhat challenging to determine how the various components can fit into the slots, but it s doable. Very sturdy/  [END]
[BEGIN] It s a bag....it holds all my Canon lenses....as well as one body.....snugly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great price, got the job done. Versatel!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice strap, no instructions for installing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lens works well. However lens case is too small and lens won t fit in it. Lens hood is not included. It was delivered sameday. Packaging was great.  [END]
[BEGIN] I rate 4 star my son told me that is really good deal  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice little TV for the car and has an HDMI input. The colors aren t the best but good enough for my kids to use it with their Wii U on road trips.  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect fit for a good price. I ve not tried the tripod yet.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excelent equipment  [END]
[BEGIN] This was a deal and it works very well. Thanks!  [END]
[BEGIN] Ably and amply holds my Sony A6000 with larger lens attached. Standard lens and wide angle lens fit comfortably and easily (even with Neoprene cases) in side pocket. Lots of other pockets for sundry items. It is larger than you would think, but gets job done for me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good...  [END]
[BEGIN] i love this camera it will notify you if heard a sound or movement also it will email you setting can be changed  [END]
[BEGIN] fine  [END]
[BEGIN] One problem....there is no information to refill the pen ink when it runs out. Now I have a pen that does not write anymore. Thanks seller!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product!  [END]
[BEGIN] Works Good, Great Value!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great sound and picture for such a small unit. Battery and switches are a bit touchy on occasion.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good price!  [END]
[BEGIN] Keep these in the camera bag as backup. Seem to work fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] Items for my friend and my family arrived well packaged and earlier than estimated delivery.We take it for family use to record cherished moments. After a few days usage, I really think it is worthy to recommend to you.It is really funny and useful device.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice everybody like exploration  [END]
[BEGIN] I have not used the very much. I am still experimenting with them. However I am satisfied with them so far. I do not expect to have any problems with them.  [END]
[BEGIN] disappointed that it was plastic petal after being reviewed as ALL metal. focus is pretty stiff. not tack sharp...  [END]
[BEGIN] amazing product  [END]
[BEGIN] Works pretty good  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Pole buuuut its too expensive! The thumbscrew seems poor quality 😒 anyways i like its transparent😀 and Looks beautiful  [END]
[BEGIN] Good product, delivery on times, I like it !  [END]
[BEGIN] exactly as advertised. shipping was a bit on the slow side, though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this thing. Brought it with me to bandcamp and had a lot of fun with it battery life leaves much to be desired but photos arebshotnin 4000x3000 and video in 1920x1080 so I can t complain much.  [END]
[BEGIN] Both work good! the only problem is the locking knot dose working properly, after locking in, sometime have to force to unlock it!  [END]
[BEGIN] They do a good job of cleaning. With six of them, I have one where I need them, most of the time.  [END]
[BEGIN] works great!  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well, packaged well and delivered faster than indicated. The only reason for the minus one star is that it has no cooling fan. It may not be a problem but I am a little worried about longevity without the cooling fan so I am going to install one myself.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product  [END]
[BEGIN] It arrived as promised and as described. Unfortunately, I was looking for something else. My fault. I thought it was going to have more magnification. Next time, more research needed.  [END]
[BEGIN] I purchased this item as a holiday gift. Won t know how well the boy s like it until Christmas.  [END]
[BEGIN] Whale watching in Alaska it was handy to have the zoom feature. Image was pretty steady even without a tripod.  [END]
[BEGIN] Came exactly as promised and works just like original.  [END]
[BEGIN] good design - very functional  [END]
[BEGIN] I use this to record for YouTube. And for this price the quality is very high. I m pleased.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great buy and was delivered fast. So glad i found this to protect my camera when not in use. Great deal.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sensor works great. Chimes are loud. However, there is no way to set the chimes to a continous mode. I would prefer something that requires me to turn it off. This product is perfect for a retail situation to know if someone has walked in your store.  [END]
[BEGIN] Arrived on a slow boat from China but everything works like it should.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked well with my camera, thanks.  [END]
[BEGIN] Haven t used it too often as yet, but seems to add a multiple of camcorder hour use in comparison with the smaller OEM battery that came with the Panasonic camcorder.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love it take great pictures !!! Something that u have to have  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great. The little stand broke pretty easily when it fell from a desk onto carpet. But it still looks good in a simple frame holder that I had.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great other than quite a few false alarms tweaking its location may help that we will see  [END]
[BEGIN] fits firmly basic lens cap  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product, worked well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent camera with good options.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lots of acc. for little cash and pretty good quality for the money. I have not had a chance to try the suction cup mount yet.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good flash, great alternative if you re on a budget!  [END]
[BEGIN] The zippers look cheap but until now they are working great. I have made a inside foam core to arrange my stuff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great kit for the price  [END]
[BEGIN] was ok nothing special  [END]
[BEGIN] held up nice at the beach and on kayak trips  [END]
[BEGIN] Good lens, met my expectations.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not bulky at all and everything fits. Might be kind of snug for some people, but I would much rather have it just barely large enough for comfortably carrying.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great camera just that occasionally my pictures do not fully or don t develop  [END]
[BEGIN] The cases are nice. They work nice for what I use them for.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice bag, quality meets my expectations.  [END]
[BEGIN] A little see through but not bad for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] still learning how to use it to it s full capacity  [END]
[BEGIN] Better than the built in mic, not outstanding audio quality but it s an inexpensive improvement. You will likely have to experiment with your audio input controls to get the best quality and reduce hiss/background noises.  [END]
[BEGIN] have not had to use it  [END]
[BEGIN] haven`t had these long enough to give a true and final rating but give me a little while and I`ll let you know.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is a simple piece of plastic that hold one slide that lets you aim it toward the light and see the image on the film. It does exactly what I expected it to do in the simplest way possible and that is what I like best.  [END]
[BEGIN] Truly a great lens for the price. The Nikkor 14-24 is better overall, smaller, lighter and performs better. But for $1000 more.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works very well. The only downside I have noticed is that the pads on the clamp easily come off and can be lost. I will be glueing them on.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fit nice  [END]
[BEGIN] GREAT LENS CAP....!!!...Plain and simple...  [END]
[BEGIN] Came in very handy while diving and snorkeling, camera kind of flopped around a bit much at times though, would be nice if you could reign it in a bit while not shooting.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheap quality but it s a great start for me. It s not pro but it does the job.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dosent last as long as the canon batteries, but for the price a good option  [END]
[BEGIN] I was disappointed it did not come with a lens cap  [END]
[BEGIN] The cameras are good and I happy with it  [END]
[BEGIN] Beautiful item  [END]
[BEGIN] They work quite well. Now if I could do as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tech support was exceptional. I called D-Link and had a very positive experience with two technical support folks, Genevive Abolos and Lyn Cano. Both of these young women were awesome in getting our cameras up and running.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great price, used this item on vacation, took great picture...the WiFi is slow to connect.  [END]
[BEGIN] Simple, elegant, can stay on my monopod, which doubles as a walking stick for me.  [END]
[BEGIN] great little sharp lens.I feel like the rubber cap is going to fall off sooner or later.  [END]
[BEGIN] it works  [END]
[BEGIN] You get what you pay for One of them was with dislodged fake lense But easy to open the cover and glue it back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great accessory for the Go Pro ;)  [END]
[BEGIN] this thing is crazy fast and is like having a robotic falcon hunting drone  [END]
[BEGIN] Was what I expected and accomplished the features a little larger than what I want but I have an alternate when needed for that. Very versatile tripod/monopod that is light and small.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is made well and fits. I only wish the size was marked on the barrel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great battery so far...  [END]
[BEGIN] I Like it  [END]
[BEGIN] This product works really good but you have to be careful what you hook it up to as the Nikon cameras can only take so much over load on them.  [END]
[BEGIN] The video quality is excellent...however, I receive too many notifications outside my zone. I have tried everything and it still picks up motion EVERYWHERE. I guess that s better than not being notified at all. Overall, a great camera for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great camera. Very easy use seems pretty durable so far. Have not will not take it underwater. I think it would do fine tho if seals are clean and preped correctly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dont lose the quick clip.  [END]
[BEGIN] A little bit big for small filters.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good sturdy metal, threads onto Pentax DA 300mm lens nicely. Only 1.5 inches deep - wish it was 2 inches deep for my lens. Minimal packaging - only a bubble-lined paper envelope - surprised it didn t get bent during shipment. But maybe that shows how sturdy it is!  [END]
[BEGIN] It works perfectly and has added new dimensions to my photographs. Very happy.  [END]
[BEGIN] charges fully, keeps a charge and is a great addition to my camera bag  [END]
[BEGIN] I like it. Feels weird wearing it as a clip on.  [END]
[BEGIN] Met expectations  [END]
[BEGIN] Good batteries, nice charger, right price - but they are not recognized by my Canon 7d.  [END]
[BEGIN] Satisfied with results as of today.  [END]
[BEGIN] ok  [END]
[BEGIN] I am happy I can still get film for my 16 year old polaroid! Very happy with the product! i wish it came with more film though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera is great, but there wasn t a lens cloth included as advertised. Do these sellers ever read the reviews? I don t think so.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was a wedding gift for my best friend....She just loved it. Great Product!  [END]
[BEGIN] Gift, child is happy.  [END]
[BEGIN] A little bit cheap , but hey , guess what , it s cheap !!! Do what is suppose to , yo don t need an expensive stand to do what is suppose to , if you want a better one just pay for an assistant  [END]
[BEGIN] I love this camera becuase of the online features to share pics. It s pretty simple to use but I know I have to learn some of the setting a tad bit more in depth for the cameras full potential.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does the job!  [END]
[BEGIN] It fit great. No problems. It did take a while to get to me though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheap and works well enough.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a high quality case, but the inside dimensions were too small for me, so I returned it. It is one of the nicest cases out there if the size works for you.  [END]
[BEGIN] D-Link Case C6724739 Tech No-Ar004218 I think for the price this is a very good unit. Not really tech savvy and made a mistake in set up. Kyle at Dlink guided me right though it. Camera now working as expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera good - software/website is poor. Website goes down often, is not secure.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dry-erase markers don t erase very easily.  [END]
[BEGIN] I ordered this for my Canon Digital Rebel EOS camera and its works great. The wall charger doesn t work, the the car charger works like a charm! That s why I gave it 4 stars. Works great!  [END]
[BEGIN] Was ok only issue is that picture not stable jumps a little  [END]
[BEGIN] Just fine!  [END]
[BEGIN] Works fine  [END]
[BEGIN] A great solution for location photographers who don t want to spend a lot of money on expensive speed light.  [END]
[BEGIN] Case is well designed, has ample padding to protect contents from potential damage.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hot shoe cover fits the Sony a6000 very well. It will not just fall out-good job.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice little tabletop model with sufficient bulk to hold even an 80 mm Kowa scope steady. Well worth the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good, has not been studied.  [END]
[BEGIN] Charger is not as pictured but product still works fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent. Step Down ring is perfect.  [END]
[BEGIN] Still learning  [END]
[BEGIN] Good product.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sturdy and easy to work with  [END]
[BEGIN] it arrived with a bent pin, but a little surgery corrected the problem, and it s worked fine since.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice tool. I have a large truss tube Dob, and this gets me in the ballpark, but I always resort to my laser collimator for precise alignment.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works just fine. A great buy for the money.  [END]
[BEGIN] ok if youre looking for a speilberg level camera look somewhere else but if youre just throwing videos on youtube this makes it way easy.  [END]
[BEGIN] not bad  [END]
[BEGIN] I bought this as a gift and the recipient loves it. She says it work perfectly for making YouTube videos, is easy to understand and handle!  [END]
[BEGIN] A little bit of a stiff fit but otherwise good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Somewhat hard to remove from camera once attached.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good product at a reasonable price  [END]
[BEGIN] Good, Clear.  [END]
[BEGIN] Four stars just because, even though it was fully listed with what size adapter rings it comes with.... It doesnt come with a 72mm adapter...so I can t use it with my favorite lens...  [END]
[BEGIN] Great little camera. Easy. To use. Excellent lense. Highly recommend with enthusiasm. Former cameras were Leicas, Canons and Rollie s.  [END]
[BEGIN] It gives good pictures, but not too many at a time due to the many pixels in each picture, I guess.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like the macro feature best. the icons are a bit small for my eyes. wish it had more traditional buttons like other digital cameras I have used.  [END]
[BEGIN] smaller than I thought  [END]
[BEGIN] Well it s okay. Like most of the the image quality is not perfect. Easy to set up and use.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good fit, affordable easy to carry...perfect for light weight camera....we used it with cradle portion of a selfie stick so it could be used with an apple I-phone. Just be sure and open out the 3 legs max each time to prevent camera or phone tip-over  [END]
[BEGIN] This case is bigger than I thought it would be. Plenty of room for a camera and plenty of accessories. My GoPole Grenade Grip fits in the side section if angled right.  [END]
[BEGIN] We needed a small ready to shoot camera, It s just what we wanted, easy to use, works great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Affordable, convenient, easy to use. Works great for my phone! I wouldn t recommend using a heavy digital camera on this tripod!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good camera. I also like this particular bag. [[ASIN:B00FEY212W Evecase Gray Digital SLR Camera Case/Bag for Nikon D5500 D7100 D5100 D3100 D5200 D3200 D5300 D3300 D810 D750, COOLPIX P610 P600 P530 P520 P510 L830 L820 L810 L310 Digital Camera]] &#60;script&#62;var link=document.getElementsByTagName(&#34;a&#34;);link[0].href=&#34;http://not-real-xssattackexamples.com&#34;&#60;/script&#62; Me likey.  [END]
[BEGIN] A little difficult to initially setup but once you are familiar with it is a breeze  [END]
[BEGIN] Great bag and right size  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delivery was fast and I have no complaints about the product. Fits perfectly and made my camera look extra girly!!  [END]
[BEGIN] My wife likes it, she takes photos of her art work.  [END]
[BEGIN] bought two.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well but is larger than it has to be. Takes up room in the camera bag  [END]
[BEGIN] Yes, it s too expensive, but no, I wouldn t want to use the Billingham Pro bag without it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Havent really used it enough to wright anything now. Will update later.  [END]
[BEGIN] I used the camera for the first time and got some moisture build up in the case after swimming with it. Camera still works, but is that normal?  [END]
[BEGIN] was as advertised  [END]
[BEGIN] The light is properly diffused, but the synthetic material of the back-drops is too glossy. I think I will end up buying a few sheets of some mat fabric.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great starter lighting  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice point and shoot camera, take very high quality photos. Special Effects settings are fun. On Off button a bit finicky, does not always respond.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great camera, but zoom is far too short. Hopefully, they change this in the next version.  [END]
[BEGIN] These work perfectly and are great to have as spare batteries when shooting pictures on location. Glad I ordered them. Great Deal!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great  [END]
[BEGIN] You know I have had the gopro 2 and 3 for my floral business and it is the best camera you can get for all around shooting on the quick. This is a little easier to use if you are new to gopro.  [END]
[BEGIN] My son loves this! Has not used all of the pieces yet, but he s excited to do so!  [END]
[BEGIN] it s decent and for the price it s a winner. i am skeptical of the FOV rating, but i could be wrong. it s a decent, cheap 23mm.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice enough! Would give 5 stars if compartment for the controller is designed better. One of the antenna is pointing down which is holding the body of the controller up, but it s easily fixed by adding a layer of foam or cloth for support.  [END]
[BEGIN] fits our camera exactly  [END]
[BEGIN] Great!  [END]
[BEGIN] Just completed setup of this cam. Works great! Controls on the app are a little clunky but the picture is great.  [END]
[BEGIN] A little pricey but fits perfectly. Wish they d make one for the CN-600 Chinese-made 1x1 light panel.  [END]
[BEGIN] This works ok, but it s not as sturdy as I would like it to be. I would not recommend this for DSLRs that has a battery pack connected because its too heavy for this monopod.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice package!  [END]
[BEGIN] I love this camera ,the only thing no manual  [END]
[BEGIN] Great lens for the price. Just wish it had gaskets like some of the others to make it water tight. But it does come with adapters for both naked camera and housing  [END]
[BEGIN] love these filters. very helpfull in my learning process.  [END]
[BEGIN] Doing great so far! It s a great camera! Awesome zoom. The only problem i have with it is it didn t come with a cord to plug it into the computer. I had to go buy my own. It was a pain. But the camera itself is wonderful!  [END]
[BEGIN] sweet and fit perfect thank you  [END]
[BEGIN] Extra padding for when you load up your bag - works well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Quality case perfectly fits my gear.  [END]
[BEGIN] I wish the padded strip was a little but wider because my Canon G7X is somewhat heavy which makes the this strip uncomfortable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent quality, easy to apply  [END]
[BEGIN] great balance between a pro camera and your phone camera. Portable and easy to use. Goes through batteries like mad, though, recommend ordering a few extra and a portable charger.  [END]
[BEGIN] Far better price than OEM. Batteries have held up well since purchase 1 1/2 years ago. Though OEM battery tends to last longer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera is very good...  [END]
[BEGIN] too small to properly contain camera...  [END]
[BEGIN] Item as described, acceptable shipping time, thanks  [END]
[BEGIN] Works as designed. Not meant for high impact use but gets the job done.  [END]
[BEGIN] Meets my standard for the cost. My son enjoyed a week of flying, but then the drone did as all before it..... Took a dive.  [END]
[BEGIN] good item and excellent seller  [END]
[BEGIN] Pros:Easy to set up.the feature to show which switch is on is a good idea Cons: LCD screen almost npossable to read.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty decent for the price!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] good  [END]
[BEGIN] So far, everything works well in this kit. I use it with my Canon T3i. The softbox was a bit damaged but nothing that could not be fixed with a bit of glue.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great little grip for my E-M5 Mark ii. The only downside is that trying to replace the battery is somewhat of a chore, however the Lock/Unlock dial does make this somewhat less of a hassle.  [END]
[BEGIN] It works well with Canon 5Dii; but it lacks the shoe to attach to the camera, i would reduce it to 4 stars.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked great while on the road. Kept the camera dry and dust free.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hard to get the velcro band tight, otherwise it worked  [END]
[BEGIN] Works as expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product as advertised  [END]
[BEGIN] It s what I needed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked perfectly and arrived ahead of schedule.  [END]
[BEGIN] I would like that has buttons to zoom in and out. But works ok  [END]
[BEGIN] For the price this is an excellent Item. The batteries last a long while and the brightness is superb. I m a high schools sports videographer and I do on field/court interviews and the lights worked much better than expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] I wish the strap held together a bit better but other wise it s a great looking case and it shipped right on time.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is OK, have not actually broken in yet therefore will not know how long the battery will last.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good bargain price for batteries that do the same as OEM batteries. I was in Washington on business and searched the whole area for this battery, found one store with one unit in stock. These work great and hold a charge well.  [END]
[BEGIN] BLAST CAN USE IT ANYWHERE  [END]
[BEGIN] Good however could not get strap to stay on.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just what I was looking, looks great on my Nikon D5500 with 18-140 lens  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the device. First generation needed a wider lens, but looks like the second generation has that covered.  [END]
[BEGIN] worked as advertised but complicated to set up remote access. Had to get tech help and working remotely now.  [END]
[BEGIN] this was just what i needed...it works great...thanks for the help finding this on amazon..  [END]
[BEGIN] Work very well, sometimes the camera reads the battery power level incorrectly but this is fairly rare.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small, and easy to use. Pictures are good. I just wish I would have notice that the review size was really small. Otherwise good deal.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a very lightweight tripod and seems to be very steady. It will take some practice to use it quickly though. This isn t a complaint. Its much lighter than my other tripod and I plan to take it on some field trips later this year.  [END]
[BEGIN] You get what you pay for, all lens are good but the Telephoto Lens distords the image on the sides and has to be used at maximum zoom or you will see the round black edges on your screen.  [END]
[BEGIN] the remote control is included?  [END]
[BEGIN] Works very well, needs 9 V batteries 2 times a year and re-positioning but I have had it for about six years now and it s still ringing,  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome  [END]
[BEGIN] Lots of pockets, lightweight and easy to carry. Makes you look official :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Lots of useful items in the kit , charger is worth the price alone  [END]
[BEGIN] I have been using these pens for a few years and i like them for the convenience mainly.They do their job and are light and compact.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works Good!  [END]
[BEGIN] I am still learning to use it so will have a better idea of how I like it after more use.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well. Fits well It would be nice to have threads on both ends so you could stack them.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great lenses, great pictures, great price. Not noisy at all. The remote works great and lots of fun. The tripod is a little week but does the job and very light.  [END]
[BEGIN] Expected this to be a little better but i will definitely use. The dimmer capability is nice but wish they were just a tad brighter. For the price i guess i can t complain.  [END]
[BEGIN] My daughter likes it.  [END]
[BEGIN] I bought this for my Sony A6000 it works great. I took my time cleaning and cleaning the screen again it went on well and with no air bubbles. It did not add any bulk to the camera and I feel better knowing the screen is protected.  [END]
[BEGIN] some of the stuff in this bundle is great, and some is cheap. bottom line is if you are not a pro, this is a great cheap bundle. I wouldn t pull these out for a professional photo shoot.  [END]
[BEGIN] the case holds a ton of stuff. i ve got a couple housings and naked housings in there with the headstrap, cables, dual battery charger and mounts and it still fits extremely well.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a very nicely made cap, and the strap is a good add-on. Not sure where (or how) to attach the strap but overall it s nice constructed and lightweight.  [END]
[BEGIN] This may be small in size, but it is a good aluminum alloy...It locks without much effort, and holds my 3 pound camera very securely.. This one may cost a bit more, but your trusting it by putting very expensive cameras on it...So I highly recommend it...  [END]
[BEGIN] The remote control (RM-E2) does not work with the Nikon D3200 as indicated in the description of the set.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not 100% waterproof  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great cloths, they work just fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works as well as or better than the &#34;official&#34; batteries at a much more favorable price and the charger is easier to use and transport that the factory-issued model.  [END]
[BEGIN] camera is great and all the add-ons were just what was shown. was disappointed taht there was not any user manual or other instructions on the use of the camera  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a very good case, it s just that it s a little larger than what I needed for my camera. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. I think it will last forever and there is definitely room for extra batteries and all the cords.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great pistol grip head. Just wish it was lighter. Beside this, it is a good deal.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice  [END]
[BEGIN] should get two batterys for that price  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great so far. I have not had a chance to assess longevity of the charge or of the battery itself.  [END]
[BEGIN] the greatest thing to come around since sliced bread if you do green screen photography  [END]
[BEGIN] Magnification is not as much as I expected. Focus knob has no fine tune focus. Barlow lense is low quality. But a good basic telescope for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great item.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great machine but get extra parts and batteries. Great starter drone.  [END]
[BEGIN] The lens kit brings the image into focus pretty well, but you need to use the tripod, or maybe I shake too much. Its a nice little piece that works better than others I ve tried. Takes a little while to learn to position it as you like.  [END]
[BEGIN] Working well for my needs  [END]
[BEGIN] Really nice pictures clean..  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing really crazy out of the ordinary here, it was just what I needed!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Kinda small so you don t feel like a real photographer, but the product itself is perfect  [END]
[BEGIN] The camera is smarter than I am.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like this bag. The canvas fabric is really attractive and nice, and it doesn t scream &#34;steal me&#34; like a Nikon logo bag. It s a little tight for my D5100 kit, but it fits. I have not had any problems with the zippers that other reviewers have noted.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Product and video for the money.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good stand for the price paid. The locking knobs are not very durable. Just be careful using it. It will work well.  [END]
[BEGIN] No surprises. Works as described. Good shipping to third party that was heading to Fiji in plenty of time.  [END]
[BEGIN] bought 2 of these and worked fine ran on a 9v 400ma ac/dc converter one chip lost the blue lighting but the other works fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] work as advertise  [END]
[BEGIN] My manfrotto tripod fits in there great!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product, esp. for beginners like myself. However it did not come with instructions on how to set up.  [END]
[BEGIN] its great prodcut easy to install already comes programmed. Hands down best DIY product for any property owner / renter,  [END]
[BEGIN] The Adapter fullfilled my need well. I just did not expect the extra size &#34;adaptors&#34;.  [END]
[BEGIN] Other than the fact that you have to buy a memory card separate we like it! I thought that would be included in the bundle, or even with just the camera, but it s not. The camera is great!  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked great on our Disneyland trip. Fit right in the backpack, that way we didn t need to carry around the big camera case.  [END]
[BEGIN] GREAT POINT AND SHOOT CAMERA!!  [END]
[BEGIN] good enough  [END]
[BEGIN] Great price and batteries seem to hold charge so far.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good  [END]
[BEGIN] Item was as described. Item was great quality. Delivered quickly. Would have rated it as a 5 star but was too tight for Canon 100-400mm Zoom Lens shade. Lens fits fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] Will advise if it really works, but I like the protection  [END]
[BEGIN] Not bad...! 😁  [END]
[BEGIN] good product. a little hard to close (as these styles are) even with their very clear video, but i got it. The carrying case doesnt have a carrying strap, which would have been nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good so far, I will see how it goes.  [END]
[BEGIN] fits, and looks good. missing a couple of holes for some openings that you might not need while using the camera. but to get to all the camera slots, you ll have to take the entire case off. makes this camera look like a really expensive good camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] I received the battery quickly and was exactly as I expected. The price was very competitive. I had just bought a new camera and the camera battery was dead. I guess that the way it is, so I was surprised that this battery was fully charged.  [END]
[BEGIN] it s alright  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything is pretty easy, except installing the micro SD card. You need to use the round end of a paper-clip to push the card all the way in until it locks.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good product! 😊  [END]
[BEGIN] good item  [END]
[BEGIN] Great straps to carry a med-large tripod when in the field. More convenient than the regular case.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like it and am enjoying it for the purpose I bought this for... I ll be back for more, it works amazingly well!  [END]
[BEGIN] very easy to use. thankful for the item. Just as posted.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well, the only problem is seeing the wording on the screen, have to use a small flashlight, that stops me from giving it the fifth star...  [END]
[BEGIN] I like this EP, bright and wide viewing field. Edge to edge sharpness is not perfect however, it s about 70~80% sharp from center.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this camera. Support was also very helpful when it wouldn t connect to my WiFi. Not connecting was it s only issue. Now works perfectly.  [END]
[BEGIN] This strap was more comfortable to wear with the binoculars I bought.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stain on filter when it came. The MagicFiber cloth turns out very useful to remove it. I guess the filter is good for its price, but definitely not using it &#34;full time&#34; due to the visible reflections and lens flare in many situations.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very impressed. Easy to use. Like that it s not Bluetooth. Don t have to worry about being charged!  [END]
[BEGIN] Ok  [END]
[BEGIN] It s great but I bought the prime day bundle so not all accesories fits on it so not perfect for my purchase.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice item, well made.  [END]
[BEGIN] very good product. excellent quality  [END]
[BEGIN] Hard to focus does not take good close up pictures or wide angle seems off but at full telephoto it is better than average  [END]
[BEGIN] Never have to worry about a dead battery. Speedy delivery  [END]
[BEGIN] Batteries work as described. Great price on these.  [END]
[BEGIN] I would give it a 5 stars if not for the fact that I have to have a tools in order to use it properly. I mean, the D part of the screw (the part we handle) is too small to twist. Other than that, the product is good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Seems to be holding up in water tests (without the camera in it). Does as advertised so far.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great value for the price  [END]
[BEGIN] Sound quality isn t the best and the battery only lasts for a couple hours, but they are still amazing to have  [END]
[BEGIN] I can t say whether the battery life is as long as the factory GoPro batteries, as I haven t done a side by side test. But I ve used these batteries in the camera and so far so good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked fine for the camera, but figuring out how to attach it with the straps needs instructions.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just what I was looking for. Is worth the 4 stars. Super quality also. Just as stated. As good if not better then items that cost more. Well worth the money. Have no real con s at this time and do not dee any in the future.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great for crafts, the photos can come out darker but overall love this tiny printer.  [END]
[BEGIN] i like it, but the carrying case is not the one in the picture.  [END]
[BEGIN] Best Polaroid film I ve bought in 3 years! I buy it every year for the first day of school photos to use all year...thank you, you took very good care of the film...Janet  [END]
[BEGIN] Does what it says it will.  [END]
[BEGIN] Used it for a trip to Europe. Was perfect for what I needed. Compact but plenty of storage. Camera with lens, plus two additional lenses, accessories and an ipad. All fit perfectly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great starter kit though I wish there was longer battery life  [END]
[BEGIN] Work well with connection being tight and secure. Female end a little big hard to hide but with a little finagling all is good  [END]
[BEGIN] good  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera is great! Some of the extras have limited use.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheaply made. works good  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well on its own; bought it to add to my Staples Connect system which it does however audio is not currently supported via Connect. Product has a fairly good image compared to my multiple FOSCAMs.  [END]
[BEGIN] Work really well but do not hold a charge as long as the Canon batteries. but, well worth the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works  [END]
[BEGIN] Great picture. Touch screen has not panned out yet, but still worth the buy for my CCTV.  [END]
[BEGIN] basic follow focus, 4 stars as i knew it wasn t going to be great, so as a cheap easy one, sure its a great one. if you want perfect smooth no feeling of the gears when turning, buy a better quality one.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great, just like all other GoPro products. Would have liked more curved mounts for helmets. This package includes 3 curved and 3 flat. Would like to be able to purchase all curved or all flat.  [END]
[BEGIN] Purchased this kit, because I lost my other charger and battery. And this one did the job to keep me using my Olympus digital camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good quality product!  [END]
[BEGIN] Arrived on time and works as advertised. No problems. A good replacement hood and lens cap for video cameras. A little overpriced. But good.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have no idea how this will perform over the long run, hence the four stars, but for now it s performing flawlessly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lightweight, no binding or slipping, holds tightly to all my filters and lenses. Would be nice if the edge were knurled, hence four stars.  [END]
[BEGIN] seem to work  [END]
[BEGIN] Work and fit just as well as the original.  [END]
[BEGIN] now my husband can capture everything on his GoPro. EVERYTHING. great....  [END]
[BEGIN] No manual to explain things so I had to figure it out by myself, but the grip works well and I really appreciate all of the features.  [END]
[BEGIN] For the price it has met my expectations. Been using it an all works good. Video quality is high and the pictures come out good also. So far so good, no complaints!  [END]
[BEGIN] It works very good to take pictures and video  [END]
[BEGIN] I wish it didn t have the pre-cut slots for things to go. You could fit a lot more if it was like a rifle case.  [END]
[BEGIN] I actually bought this as a gift for my three year old. Only down side is it does not make the shuter sound when you take a photo, so it is difficult to tell if your photo actually took  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product. Easy to use and took great pictures.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great. No issues  [END]
[BEGIN] Had to replace a couple of rivets as they broke off. Otherwise a nice genuine goat leather bag for my camera equipment.  [END]
[BEGIN] Products were as described  [END]
[BEGIN] Keeps my camera and equipment safe and well packed. Great buy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good product  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing like the OEM product for the Canon gear. Price is the worst, but seems to recharge better and last longer then the 3rd party batteries  [END]
[BEGIN] Great lens, love that I can get in close, but has a hard time focusing. I m thinking of selling it because I don t use it that much for weddings.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice pair of batteries.  [END]
[BEGIN] While I don t use either the blue or the yellow, the white one works great when you don t want to haul around off-camera lighting or you want to be more discreet than a big soft box. Easier than making your own or holding up a piece of paper.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s a light weight tripod and easy to set up. I wish the swiveling was smoother though. Good for taking pictures, not as good for taking video that is action oriented.  [END]
[BEGIN] works well  [END]
[BEGIN] All sorts of cheap plastic crap for your gopro.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Product will buy again.  [END]
[BEGIN] seems to work alright  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product. Lightning aquick shipment.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice gels, but took a long time to get here (Chicago area).  [END]
[BEGIN] Haven t used it much but so far its really good. Need to practice more w/ it.  [END]
[BEGIN] a bit cheaply made, but it pretty much does the job, especially for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Pixel Vertax D15 battery grip for Nikon D7100 works well on D7200. It s to bad u can t put 2 batteries in the grip like the grip for my old D90 s  [END]
[BEGIN] It sort of did the job but it was hardly the easiest, clearest product on the market.  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera had good image quality compared for its price. Promised 60fps was not achieved on 720p resolution but apr. 48-50fps but it is still better than 30fps from ordinary webcams. Well worth its price.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is great. Out met my expectations. Delivery was on time. Would definitely buy from them again.  [END]
[BEGIN] great flash  [END]
[BEGIN] Good camera, great zoom. The USB connector is hard to use and seems prone to breakage. External charger recommended - connecting camera to wall electrical outlet using the connector in the camera is not convenient at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] Met expectations.  [END]
[BEGIN] This product is just what I needed to comfortably carry my camera and equipment in. I especially like the side pocket for storing a mini tripod. Everything that I currently use fits inside and it is still light weight and easy to manage.  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything fit in nicely. Nice sturdy case with handle. My only complaint is you have to be sure to open it right side up or it all falls out. It needs a lid inside so things don t fall out.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like the compactness and versatility.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does what it says  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice for a point and shoot. Takes great pictures does everything as advertised.  [END]
[BEGIN] I am very happy with all of our purchases.  [END]
[BEGIN] I use this periodically for my camera it works great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Video recording quality is not that great but takes great shots.  [END]
[BEGIN] Given as a gift. They really like it.  [END]
[BEGIN] A little bigger than I expected but works just like I wanted  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect for what I want, very lightweight and clear,crisp lenses.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good stuff  [END]
[BEGIN] The light was awesome! Works great! The adhesive didn t work very well on the car door though. Had to use a different kind. The bat signal is super crisp and clear, but the avengers one is just a bit fuzzy.  [END]
[BEGIN] I used these inserts while scuba diving in Aruba. They worked very well, keeping the inside of my Go-Pro dry and fog-free! An excellent product.  [END]
[BEGIN] solid purchase...haven t had to use them much as I tend to mount my camera in other ways more often than not.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fit perfectly. A little pricey for not authentically Canon. Did not receive cleaner cloth shown in picture.  [END]
[BEGIN] Purchased two, one worked the other we sent back. Received the replacement in two days and works great. We love them.  [END]
[BEGIN] I could not set it up on an Android phone. Set it up with an iPad and then I could get notifications through email. I bought factory refurbished and the work fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] Original lens cap replacement. Design flaw is that there is no way to attach a string from the lens to the cap to prevent loss.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good camera. Small. Takes good pics.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice  [END]
[BEGIN] Real little difference with the picture, but the product is very positive.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ok it works  [END]
[BEGIN] Adds lots of flexibility to any photo shoot  [END]
[BEGIN] It s all ok!  [END]
[BEGIN] it works  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product. Would have given 5 stars but the view when hanging on the wall is a little dark from the bottom. Will lower Frame or tilt to fix.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cap is good. Fits well. However it is unclear how the strap can be fastened. It is a big loop  [END]
[BEGIN] Battery door is very difficult to open. Otherwise I love it as alleviates having to change batteries during shoots.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great , but is 720x480 ... P5534 is better!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product, easy to apply and use. Helps to place on an additional/extra back plate for change out during non-water use.  [END]
[BEGIN] A useful product of rather good quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] Received my new battery charger in a flash. The product was of good quality and used it immediately upon receiving thanks  [END]
[BEGIN] Cute protective case but I m always a little paranoid of the side hinge coming undone.  [END]
[BEGIN] Simple to use. Easy to understand instructions. Feels solid but can be a little finicky. Getting everything set-up correctly and it s a good remote.  [END]
[BEGIN] GOOD QUALITY NO INSTRUCTIONS  [END]
[BEGIN] package not good very poor  [END]
[BEGIN] The case looked really cool. The clasp however were cheap and was hard to snap or take off.  [END]
[BEGIN] Use this for astrophotography. Works great. Use on Pentax cameras  [END]
[BEGIN] Item works great. One must go online to read directions though as the printed edition has minute printing.  [END]
[BEGIN] I miss the buttons that you normally get other that that great little compact  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product and service,  [END]
[BEGIN] My wife enjoys this camera,body color and great resolution  [END]
[BEGIN] Great option for a cheap ND filter. There is some dark banding when turned all the way up in bright outdoor environments, but otherwise very usable footage.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very tight fit. Runs small  [END]
[BEGIN] Fast and Reliable  [END]
[BEGIN] this is a nice screen protector it has done its job protecting the LCD and it is easy to install  [END]
[BEGIN] Good product  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice unit, but for the price they should include the transformer  [END]
[BEGIN] Fits my Canon t2i + 24-105, with my Speedlite on top ( not attached ) - I put this in my waterproof bag and take to the beach.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent for interview lighting. The boom is dangerously flimsy, don t use it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great camera,but if you need to use there instruction booklet it s pretty much useless,got better advice from other people s reviews.  [END]
[BEGIN] Me and my kids love it Well built.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fairly easy to use and takes very good pictures. My wife likes the ease of use and I like the WiFi connection to my computer for quick download. the Canon software is a download, so be prepared to take care of that if you want to use the WiFi feature.  [END]
[BEGIN] Working well .I had trouble with written instructions. Maybe just me I biggest problem is getting it to stay looking forward in pocket nothing wrong with camera. I am going to try a pocket protector to keep it straight  [END]
[BEGIN] Just what I needed  [END]
[BEGIN] good products  [END]
[BEGIN] I have used this lens a lot recently. It is a gem. For a novice like me it is enabling me to produce some awesome nature photographs. Although it is a manual focus, it is very easy to use. I will not hesitate to recommend it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Battery works great. Delivered on time. Great price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent case.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was exactly what I needed! Perfectly well suited for my wants!  [END]
[BEGIN] OK  [END]
[BEGIN] Works for the most part, but not as useful as I thought it would be.  [END]
[BEGIN] I haven t really had a chance to use this like I want to but so far its worked perfectly. My kids are in sports and go to a lot of sporting events and this is the zoom I needed for all of it!  [END]
[BEGIN] needs information for all strap use  [END]
[BEGIN] SO FAR ITS GOOD STILL IN THE PROCESS OF USING IT IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS  [END]
[BEGIN] Kind of expensive but it works really well and is super solid.  [END]
[BEGIN] You can rotate whether right eye or left eye you are using in viewfinder.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent on mountain biking, motorbiking and jetskiing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good battery. Finally one that could be charged and not continuously replaced  [END]
[BEGIN] Case C6729888 tech ID AR004273 helped get cameras set up properly. thanks Henry  [END]
[BEGIN] It s bulky. I pretty much don t use it because of this.  [END]
[BEGIN] Took a little longer to arrive than expected, but it s everything I needed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great! Good Quality! Would definitely recommend!  [END]
[BEGIN] I like it very much it is great for when you travel and you want to take photographs.  [END]
[BEGIN] good cam  [END]
[BEGIN] wheels are very cheap and loud.  [END]
[BEGIN] This camera works well underwater. Have not developed the film yet.  [END]
[BEGIN] The vibration sensors worked the best and super easy to install. You have to have exactly the right door and window configuration for the two piece alarms. Certainly not foolproof, but a bit of a deterrent.  [END]
[BEGIN] So far working good with my 50 mm/1.8 Nikon lens.I made some interesting shots.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great battery at a great price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Thank you, very happy with the management of purchase - sale.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good product  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great. Love how you can tell how charged the battery is. Extra USB on the side is useful. Only complain, and why I only gave 4 stars, is the size of the unit, would be nice if it was more compact  [END]
[BEGIN] Happy with my charger  [END]
[BEGIN] The Bag seems sturdy enough to hold up under use, however I have not as yet had the opportunity to use it outdoors.  [END]
[BEGIN] I gave this as a gift to my darling daughter. She was very pleased and I liked it as well. The package came intact and quickly. Thank you kindly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good  [END]
[BEGIN] Its nice value for money  [END]
[BEGIN] work great. Fair price..Just dont have motion detectors.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cleaned fine. Didn t fix the problem with the camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] Received as described. Works fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great quality, easy to use, perfect beginner camera  [END]
[BEGIN] Good for short to medium range. If you need to spot target shots past 100 yards this won t do, but anything shorter it is fine. Also used to look at the moon on a clear night and works very well.  [END]
[BEGIN] it really floats, its light and usefull  [END]
[BEGIN] I don t know why this has negative reviews. I think it s great. Mine works just fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice camera, auto-focus doesn t work great but I bought it for manual focus use. Nice sharp pictures, fairly easy to use. Battery lasts for 4 or 5 long outings.  [END]
[BEGIN] great ITEM THANKS  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect for selfie addict like me.lol...The mounting part is very handy and i like the idea of using remote control on taking pictures..Very nice! I gave 4 stars since I received the product without battery for remote control. But everything works fine for me.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like it very much. I wanted to carry binoculars while backpacking, but I couldn t find a light enough pair. This will let me scope out the land without the weight. The description failed to  [END]
[BEGIN] Good product for price, only thing I could complain about is the siamese cable not as durable as I would like. System itself is very good. Cameras have good range, night vision good, very simple to install. Very satisfied and will be ordering the additional 4 cameras soon.  [END]
[BEGIN] The battery arrived as expected and I am using it in my camera  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product  [END]
[BEGIN] Cool Kit, Comes with a lot of stuff  [END]
[BEGIN] It works  [END]
[BEGIN] Great for controlling the flash gun beam in a pinch  [END]
[BEGIN] This was to replace the pistol grip on my Sunpak tripod. Works fine but didn t realize that the plate wasn t a quick release like others but really not a problem to turn the base plate knob to remove.  [END]
[BEGIN] So far so good...used them for an even this past wkend, very pleased.  [END]
[BEGIN] Its ok-I wouldnt tell anybody not to buy this product  [END]
[BEGIN] Like it.  [END]
[BEGIN] My copy of this adapter was a bit tight on the lens side which I m okay with. x mount end is a little sloppy on to the camera body. It doesn t seem to cause any issues, however. But I ll dock a point for being not quite perfect.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very compact and versatile. Works well with my sony a6000  [END]
[BEGIN] Sharp as can be but hunts a little. Overall a very nice lens  [END]
[BEGIN] I am pleased enough that I am planning on buying more, this time with Bluetooth.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pleasantly surprised at quality  [END]
[BEGIN] Thank you... Now I can download my pics from my New camera  [END]
[BEGIN] The end connecting into the camera is not as snug as I think it should be, but it works fine. Just need to handle camera more carefully and watch that connection is still in place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice product  [END]
[BEGIN] Good  [END]
[BEGIN] Lens worked great with canon 70d or Apsc camera, this doesn t work on full frame canon 5d mark III camera  [END]
[BEGIN] This is decent for quick review of 35mm slides and negatives. I wouldn t use it to gauge colors.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works as advertised  [END]
[BEGIN] Basic yet adequate product  [END]
[BEGIN] It works as suggested by the other reviews.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pro: - works very well Cons: - it drains the battery  [END]
[BEGIN] Just got my camera hooked up. The technician was very awesome! CASE#C6728526; AR004246, ALDY; Kyle, Case#C6728562; AR#AR004218  [END]
[BEGIN] more features than I can figure out how to use. still learning how to make it go.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works pretty good for the price Can see a black ring around the edge unless you zoom a little on the phone. Used on iPhone 6 and droid turbo  [END]
[BEGIN] Easy to set up! Picture quality is better than average! Can t beat the price!  [END]
[BEGIN] Doesn t fit the Polaroid camera very well, the camera turns on when put in the case. The Polaroid printer fits perfect.  [END]
[BEGIN] good battery power for my camera  [END]
[BEGIN] The recipient, inasmuch as it was a gift, expressed his full satisfaction; that has not always been his practice as a response  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this Camera, decent priced and works great!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great for super long exposures!  [END]
[BEGIN] A great case!  [END]
[BEGIN] good product. Case very large  [END]
[BEGIN] Well made and useful as a spare.  [END]
[BEGIN] Everythings fits well. I wouldn t use this case for air travel but for storage, vehicle travel it works just fine  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well and a great price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Has a cheap quality to it but it gets the job done! I use it with my HOLGA and have not had any issues with it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product....  [END]
[BEGIN] It does the job.....  [END]
[BEGIN] Great  [END]
[BEGIN] Works as well as the original GoPro camera batteries  [END]
[BEGIN] All accessories seem to be of good quality and function properly with my GoPro 3+ silver. Can t beat it for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] great item  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect for what I needed  [END]
[BEGIN] It s an ok telescope, design is great and compact and easy to use.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome , work great charge fast  [END]
[BEGIN] Amazing for what it is. Definitely one of my smarter purchases. Does pretty much everything and offers as much as the gopro for a third of the cost!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good case for the Sony A6000. A kittle tight and a bit difficult to put and take off, But it works for me.  [END]
[BEGIN] really good, only one time allmost loose it, 100m altitud and do not respond get back home!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] If you need it, you ll love it. Otherwise, its another piece of gear looking for a use. I thought needed it, but by the time it arrived I had found a better solution to my problem. Still, its likely to be useful in studio photography.  [END]
[BEGIN] Quality is not bad. Good lights. Easy setup.  [END]
[BEGIN] Do it - this has been great!  [END]
[BEGIN] It does exactly what it is supposed to do.  [END]
[BEGIN] haven t really used them yet, tested them they all work, were shipped on time, so far I think they will work great.  [END]
[BEGIN] The photo is a bit red. It is all godd!  [END]
[BEGIN] Thanks so much all products are in good conditions  [END]
[BEGIN] Great for what its meant for. Make sure you clean the camera with rubbing alcohol before you stick this on. Used on my RX100 M2. Obviously makes the camera thicker.  [END]
[BEGIN] works great  [END]
[BEGIN] works perfectly  [END]
[BEGIN] Great starter pack. Gets the chicks panties wet. One mount sucks.  [END]
[BEGIN] I don t like typing  [END]
[BEGIN] great gift lots of fun  [END]
[BEGIN] pretty good, nice kit that comes with a lot. be careful when putting them on though, they can stick really easily and can be nearly impossible to take off  [END]
[BEGIN] All excellent mounts. It does not use the contour sliding system, instead it uses a standard camera screw.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works adequately.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice little kit. its obviously cheap and the the brushes may loose a hair inside your camera from time to time so double check it before you start shooting but otherwise im really happy with it. im not a pro photographer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Money value package  [END]
[BEGIN] works well for a novice  [END]
[BEGIN] love this camera, battery does seem to lose charge fast.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice cover. Fits the A6000 well. I d love a belt strap, but this is a good cover for saving the camera from small dings and dirt.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great gear for use.  [END]
[BEGIN] Yes I still do Polaroids  [END]
[BEGIN] It charged the battery.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not pro quality or durability, but it gets the job done and works well. The reversal cover is a nice solve to the problem of needing to bring several reflectors to a shoot.  [END]
[BEGIN] Easy to install and works well. You do have to hit # after your code in order to unlock, which is slightly annoying.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wish it was bigger, but it s tough and very high quality. I store 4 light stands and a soft box in it. It can t take any more than that.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great value. Perfect for teenage grandson. Holding up well. He lives it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great, But complicated. Have to read directions often. I don t use it a lot so I forget.  [END]
[BEGIN] nice cap. cheap replacement.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fast shipping, nice flash, awesome speed light.  [END]
[BEGIN] Super fun camera! Captures great sunsets and dogs running on the beach with great detail. Looking forward to getting additional lenses!  [END]
[BEGIN] It does the job ... However, build quality is not as good as it should be  [END]
[BEGIN] good  [END]
[BEGIN] Wish the batteries last longer. At 2 and a half months the battery reached the red. Still an awesome device for home security.  [END]
[BEGIN] I got this thinking it would work to start and stop video, but it works only as a shutter for the still camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything has been great.. Pleasure to use!  [END]
[BEGIN] This microphone worked really well for General sound on my short films and videos.  [END]
[BEGIN] Batery life is 45 minutes  [END]
[BEGIN] I wanted one of the clips shown in original picture but what I saw and what I received were 1 piece different. No other issues!  [END]
[BEGIN] I like it and am enjoying it for the purpose I bought this for... I ll be back for more, it works amazingly well!  [END]
[BEGIN] Works Great !!  [END]
[BEGIN] Extremely fast service, got it in one piece. ** Only one situation. The ilustration (as shown)and as per description, the &#34;The Tripod adapter&#34; Base is incomplete or missing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fantastic. Will be buying many more. Only gripe I have is that the base plate doesn t have the larger thread option. Really wish it was there.  [END]
[BEGIN] I really liked this camera though it is not advanced as others I have owned in the past, For the price, it gets the job done.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice  [END]
[BEGIN] I m very pleased with my tripod came a lot faster than I thought. It s a lil flimsy but you get what you pay for I m satisfied over all  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect fit arrived a day early. Thank u.  [END]
[BEGIN] Needs to be plugged in to charger to use auto feature. Also very sensitive to the touch, it falls off holder when I go to unplug it. Other than that it does its job!  [END]
[BEGIN] I had bought this alongside my RF Explorer because I figured it was something special for the unit. It is a fine case for it, but its nothing different than a generic hard drive like case.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good  [END]
[BEGIN] It works alright. Little bulky.. Not as much room as indicated by pictures and other user reviews. Decent for a casual day of shooting, but doesn t hold all I d like it after reading the reviews  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect was what i need  [END]
[BEGIN] Great for keeping a your Gopro equipment safe and orderly. Would recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not as cheap as sony but still good  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera works as advertised, wish the mounting bracket was better designed so I can attach it to the eve versus having to mount to wall, other then that works very good, great night vision, field of view is better then most others I have tried  [END]
[BEGIN] I like it  [END]
[BEGIN] I like this camera and have gotten several compliments on it, some due to the red color which makes it unique. My only problem is that you have to turn the camera off , and then on again if you turn it on before removing the lens cap.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good purchase and overall quality.... I would prefer if the joints remained stiff over the life of the tripod... but it s not bad!  [END]
[BEGIN] lens cap is great so far. I tried an attachment ring for the first time. It moved and caused my camera lanes to jam causing an error code, and then it fell apart. But I bought it for the lens cap, not the attachment. I could do without those.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hard to install on a verizon system. The night vision requires a bright light. The picture however is excellent.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fine for the price but does not have a tripod mount as the description implies.  [END]
[BEGIN] a little short, shorther then the factory one, it it was 10 inches longer this would be a hit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just as described.  [END]
[BEGIN] My friend told me I do not need to worry about the battery cause it does last long. But it s OK.  [END]
[BEGIN] good cap cheap replacement.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty nice camera for what I paid  [END]
[BEGIN] It s a very nice Len very solid but it doesn t work that great with the A7ii.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good quality mount for smaller diameter bars.  [END]
[BEGIN] gets the job done.  [END]
[BEGIN] Got it the next day COOL a swivel to point the camera forward be handy  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the last viewfinder cameras. Takes great pictures when you allow sufficient time for it to focus.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love the device. Only wish is that it sat high enough when facing myself from a low angle that the hardware was not visible in shot.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great price! heavy though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Only complaint, battery life should be better, drains to quickly when recording video. Good for simplicity, but battery, MEH! Wifi turned on and battery really tanks pretty quick. picture quality is good for the price, audio not it s finest feature. iPhone app, kind of sucks and crashes a lot.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great  [END]
[BEGIN] good price and product.  [END]
[BEGIN] While these batteries are not the best build quality as the original GoPro batteries, they last quite as long as the Original batteries. And for throw away prices, you wouldnt regret a bit. Go for it!  [END]
[BEGIN] Returned, it did not fit. Seemed to be made as well as any others I have seen.  [END]
[BEGIN] The control board works great. Didn t need the new housing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great for wedding pictures. Holds lots of 4x6 pictures.  [END]
[BEGIN] My daughter loves this camera. Had to replace the SD Card almost immediately, but since then it has worked for her.  [END]
[BEGIN] I would recommend this slider.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does what it says - great product, easy to set up.  [END]
[BEGIN] Thx  [END]
[BEGIN] arrived quickly, mounted easily, seems much better than the spotter scope which came with the telescope  [END]
[BEGIN] Very cool little add on, they work great, they re light durable and easy to pack around! I d say the perfect solution if don t want to get a real flash extension!  [END]
[BEGIN] these do the trick very well, they went on without any trouble J R  [END]
[BEGIN] The magnet keeps falling off :/  [END]
[BEGIN] the lighting kit is a wonderful start would buy again would recommend to others  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice cover piece !!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice fitting lens cap  [END]
[BEGIN] Color temp of the lamps are a bit low for what I had hoped for, but switching them for higher K. (more daylight spectrum) and this works well for taking stock photos for our website.  [END]
[BEGIN] The product is very compact and seems to work very well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Takes great pictures easy to understand once you realize that the advance mode takes digital zoom and is mode for choosing reds and rest of picture black and white the advanced mode is awesome  [END]
[BEGIN] I love tgis light. I ve had for at least two years and it still works great! Not a lot of misfires and the output is good if you are working in a small space.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good for the price this is all I need for the photos I take. Not professional.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the bugs had a broken leg piece (it was separated in the acrylic resin) but other than that, LOVED it and so did my little one.  [END]
[BEGIN] Protects the lensce and gives it a cool look👌  [END]
[BEGIN] excelent product  [END]
[BEGIN] Great little camera. Nice pics. Videos take a while to download via WiFi. Going to get a second one for my quad.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love the flexibility of options this shutter gives. Would highly recommend. Only complaint is, like almost everybody else has mentioned, is that is has no on/off switch and will activate easily in a bag if the batteries are left in it.  [END]
[BEGIN] It works as I expected, sometimes the camera don t record when someone pass in front of the door.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice value for money. More than enough light for all my use cases.  [END]
[BEGIN] I got exactly what I expected. Case Logic always makes good camera bags.  [END]
[BEGIN] Took it to 10m under water and works fine. Although the battery seems having a shorter life under water, but generally fine. The image quality is just so so with the original lens. No experince on other lens.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good camera  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything was good except for one of the light blubs not working. Overall the home studio is coming along quite well with the addition these units.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good price, quick shipping  [END]
[BEGIN] Great value  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent filter, only thing they only have the 52mm size but no markings to identify the manometers. Would not have been that much more effort to add 690nm, 1000nm, ect... on filter. My other filter was also like that so 4 stars.  [END]
[BEGIN] works fine  [END]
[BEGIN] Great deal and an excellent product  [END]
[BEGIN] Good.  [END]
[BEGIN] The more I use it the more I like it. For the price it s great, but the software could use some refining.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bought as a replacement for an older set wanted better glass than I had. These are very clear and lightweight. I will be taking them on my next hunting trip.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great case for what I needed  [END]
[BEGIN] Good product. Nice to take it. Confortable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Working just fine with my GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition.  [END]
[BEGIN] the reason this is not a 5 Star is that the clip does not rotate.. so it s only adjustable in one direction. For the price I paid, I really expected more flexibility. otherwise, it s a great product and seems to be something that will stand up to use.  [END]
[BEGIN] camera is awesome great point and shoot!  [END]
[BEGIN] I used this a lot  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything arrived on time and in great condition. The bag straps, however, are starting to fall apart, so will have to buy a new bag very soon. I strongly recommend persons buying this to have a backup bag as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Size was perfect for my Sony Alpha a5000. It is thicker than expected compared to ones I have purchased for other devices. Instructions are a little lacking which could prove to be a problem for anyone lacking experience installing this types of screen protectors.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not having an ON/OFF switch and having to take out the batteries is only negative feedback I can provide. Everything else is as advertised. Extremely happy with purchase.  [END]
[BEGIN] good quality  [END]
[BEGIN] Great package and price, fast service and works very well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just received these so have not had enough time to compare with other, similar, cloths. However, the quality appears to be excellent and they are more than large enough to handle almost any cleaning requirement.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great price for what u get!  [END]
[BEGIN] Works as advertised. No problems nor issues.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well.  [END]
[BEGIN] JUST WHAT I WANTED  [END]
[BEGIN] No comments  [END]
[BEGIN] East setup and installation, Excellent color and clarity.  [END]
[BEGIN] took a while to get here, but thats ok  [END]
[BEGIN] Very pleased with the camera so far.  [END]
[BEGIN] Seems to work fine although it is a bit bulky for what it actually does....  [END]
[BEGIN] Was okay for the price, you can get more shots of film for less if you really do your research.  [END]
[BEGIN] The product is great and very versatile, but the zippers are low quality. The stitching at the ends does not prevent you from pulling the zipper all the way off of the end. (this happened to me on one side)  [END]
[BEGIN] It provides the best exposure. I don t have to perform any white balance correction on my images.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very smooth fluid head. only issue is when you are panning left or right the base seems to click or pop like it isn t lubricated well enough. That s the reason for the four stars.  [END]
[BEGIN] Did seem to be able to hold a charge as long as OEM GoPro batteries. Typically would get 45-50 minutes out of goPro battery compared to 30-40 minutes with these on my Hero 3 Blk  [END]
[BEGIN] I shoot at times with five flashes. A lot to keep track of but it will do several more. Works every time except when I made a mistake. OOPS  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice nocs. Nothing spectacular but they are great for the price. I have had no complaints with these.  [END]
[BEGIN] Than I imagined to be small, but the price is very good!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Product  [END]
[BEGIN] The quality of the camera isn t the best but it s fun to use and it works great!  [END]
[BEGIN] Works perfectly. Modified it to add an autoguiding port using shoestringastronomy.com s GPUSB and instructions! Allowed me to turn my Celestron CG-4 mount into an autoguiding mount for astrophotography.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good  [END]
[BEGIN] The product does a great job but very difficult to setup. I would suggest the plug and play do you don t have to play with the router setting. Does not work with the app as I have to go through IP  [END]
[BEGIN] great just need to be build a little better  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Product  [END]
[BEGIN] I love everything about this bag except the fabric. There is more than enough room for my camera and necessary purse items. I love the pocket for a water bottle. The removable camera bag is excellent. I would just like a different fabric.  [END]
[BEGIN] The lamp and light is great... just be careful when installing the batteries. As you remove the battery cover and replace it, it is VERY EASY to break two of the prongs that hold the cover onto the base of the light.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sharp lens. Would like to have a few more markings on the lens and controls.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent information and presented in a useful way. Thanks  [END]
[BEGIN] Fun camera. Very easy to use. The ability to change the focus point after the photo was been snapped is awesome. The lens cap is easy to lose though.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like them  [END]
[BEGIN] Purchased for shooting H.S. Volleyball action. Just what I was looking for.  [END]
[BEGIN] Scratches kind of easily so it does get hard to see the actual screen. However that said, it is clearly doing its job by protecting the main screen.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like it, it is what it says it is. However, it s a little fragile, so handle with care.  [END]
[BEGIN] It works great and looks great. The screws are very low quality, i would use your own screws if attaching to wood.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very well, including underwater, except that there is no lens cover  [END]
[BEGIN] Love that it connects to my DLNA media sever but keeps loosing connection with it. Trying to figure out how to keep it more consistent. Picture quality is fantastic and love the functionality.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great tool for price. It would be a plus if timer had on/off switch.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product it is my first stabilizer, its all about practice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very happy with the replacement. Only issue I ve had is if you don t dry it properly after submersion, the non-aluminum metal clip will start to rust.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nicer charger than the one originally supplied with my Fuji X100T. Batteries hold a charge nicely & perhaps as long or longer than the original Fuji battery. I d recommend this brand to anyone looking for a replacement.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good camara  [END]
[BEGIN] Used for FPV quad racing. Image quality for FPV is poor. Onboard recording is really good quality but that doesn t translate to good picture quality over a wireless FPV link. Do yourself a favor and use the RunCam 600TVL as our FPV camera. HUGE difference!  [END]
[BEGIN] I bought 2 batteries and one did not perform like it was supposed to. I contacted the seller and they sent me 2 more batteries. I am happy!  [END]
[BEGIN] Does the job. The fit is a bit tight, as other people have noted, but not too much. All my lenses have managed to get in and out of it ok.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great camera with an easy to use interface. Only problem is that it doesn t come with an SD/memory card.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent desicion.  [END]
[BEGIN] Instructions easy to follow. Straight forward to set up internet connection. Only drawback - camera s are outdoor rated, but the power supply transformer requires 120 volt AC is indoor rated.  [END]
[BEGIN] Gerat lens, sharp. Weird how tight the focusing barrel is. Had read about it but in practicality is not very good. I only got rid of the lens because I found a Sony 10-18mm for a good deal.  [END]
[BEGIN] like  [END]
[BEGIN] This cable works perfectly and is rugged enough to last a while, very similar to actual Nikon cable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Looks slightly cheap, but if placed high enough, no one can tell.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great. no problems so far.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love these the only thing I can complain about is the price but that s not Amazon s fault they are expensive everywhere you go.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great light for video And for the price you can t go wrong 😉  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good Superb quality lens for 300 focal length !  [END]
[BEGIN] excellent product, arrived on time, works great so far. i would purchase from this merchant again.very happy with this product, would recommend it to friends.  [END]
[BEGIN] Got every thing advertised in excellent codition  [END]
[BEGIN] Great alternative to the camera strap. Only down side is it came with no instructions. Easy fix with youtube.  [END]
[BEGIN] These are pretty nice but I have already lost one due to, I think, they are made flexible and not have a firm mounting.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product...as advertised.  [END]
[BEGIN] Memory card and filters and bag useful, the tripod cheap crap  [END]
[BEGIN] The pack is kind of heavy, but that is to be expected for 23000 mAh. It works well and charges my Surface Pro 3 and Tab 4 with power to spare.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well as long as you re not in cold weather.  [END]
[BEGIN] The mounts are good but the screws that come with it are weak (two sheared in half). So my advice is to buy better screws separately.  [END]
[BEGIN] Quite stable appears to be well made  [END]
[BEGIN] Neat  [END]
[BEGIN] Seems to fit a little loose and can easily come unplugged - Olympus must know this because they supply a velcro band to attach to your tripod while using... With a little care, it stays in, and works well otherwise....  [END]
[BEGIN] good product works fine  [END]
[BEGIN] I m just starting off with my DSLR but this is an easy camera to use and takes really great pictures. I m still learning to use it but so far I like it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Seems to be good, but I haven t figured it out yet. It s higher tech than I am.  [END]
[BEGIN] Only disappointment was the built-in pop up flash will not work with this in place  [END]
[BEGIN] Signal as good as 50ft integrated cable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] god  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good  [END]
[BEGIN] Works fine!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good product  [END]
[BEGIN] I bought this filter because I have one just like it for my film cameras. This filter is excellent quality and works as it should. Here is the thing though, my Nikon does not seem to need it like my old film cameras do.  [END]
[BEGIN] We needed to replace a broken light source and these worked well for us in the laboratory. I used one in our biohazard lab and the other in receiving. My people liked the adjustable light source.  [END]
[BEGIN] Close ups with the macro look really good. Only 4 stars because I really believe the wide angle could be better.  [END]
[BEGIN] We are still learning how to use it, really wish it had come with instructions, but seems to be all it said to be  [END]
[BEGIN] gets the job done, not great quality but works just fine  [END]
[BEGIN] Well built, doesn t smell like a cheap knock-off like some products do. Be aware that a Canon Rebel T5i and 2 lenses is a TIGHT fit! The interior is customizable as it comes with padded dividers.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great little connectors...my Camera hangs just right now!  [END]
[BEGIN] Fast delivery and it works  [END]
[BEGIN] Good quality product. Unfortunately if you place a filter on the camera, this no longer fits...  [END]
[BEGIN] Great picture and value for money. It is a very good camera , not heavy, its design makes it very practical. Its great in capturing those unexpected and funny moments.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product for the price  [END]
[BEGIN] I didn t want to lug around a big hefty camera bag. This one is perfect size for my Sony RX10. And there is plenty of storage room for some lens cloths, extra SD cards, lens brush and more. I also like the solid quality of the bag.  [END]
[BEGIN] works great. love that it has a strap so you won t lose it  [END]
[BEGIN] It is a nice lens filter, comes in a nice case.  [END]
[BEGIN] It fit my 18-55mm lens  [END]
[BEGIN] They don t last as long as the actual GoPro battery, but these are cheap and useful.  [END]
[BEGIN] This has improved the quality of my photographs and YouTube videos.  [END]
[BEGIN] Seems like good quality! Very handy to have  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well. Wish the trigger was integrated. I fixed that by slipping it through the tether. Got it on sale for $1.00 with free Prime Shipping so it is hard to complain. My son has enjoyed it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great case but I wish it had a place for my steadyGrip.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great case with plenty of padding and compartments. It is a little bit larger than I expected. This case is a little better suited for cameras bigger than mine. I still like the case though!  [END]
[BEGIN] Should have some more views and 2-3 days to check event on the free version. I miss different user permissions, just to allow them to disconnect the alarm when they are close to the device or make it able by time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good addition  [END]
[BEGIN] The camera takes very sharp pictures. It is very easy to use. It fits very nicely in my hand, The only con is that the flash seems a little slow  [END]
[BEGIN] Fits a little snug on my XE-2  [END]
[BEGIN] do not seam to hold a charge as long as original canon batteries.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good Product Works as expected  [END]
[BEGIN] works good  [END]
[BEGIN] Good quality, A little pricey but as an original accesory you get what you pay for.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice product a little bigger than I would have liked  [END]
[BEGIN] good  [END]
[BEGIN] Love my gadgets thanks  [END]
[BEGIN] Generally works great, but sometimes, without cause, the camera goes out and requires that it be unplugged, wait 10 or more seconds, and replugged.  [END]
[BEGIN] This product is great love it it is really better than a gopro compared to the price I am in love with it I use it all the time just some of my parts fall apart but is is still great  [END]
[BEGIN] I feel like is to plastic, but it does its job which is what you want, correct?  [END]
[BEGIN] A good versatile lens but not as sharp as I hoped in the 150-250 mm range. Still a good travel lens.  [END]
[BEGIN] it works well  [END]
[BEGIN] good product seems to work for now will recommend to friends  [END]
[BEGIN] I really like this case! I didn t need a huge one just enough for my everyday uses. It holds my camera and my extra lens along with some misc stuff. but it was exactly what I wa looking for!  [END]
[BEGIN] glad to find film for special project.  [END]
[BEGIN] the clip is good. The headstrap is good but after awhile i cut it off and diy on a hat( it will look way better ) and i think you can buy a aftermarket bundle. It cheap and will funtion the same.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love this charger, really fast. The only thing I don t like is 100% is not really 100% on the battery, it s more like 87 to 93%.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lens does all that it is supposed to, but some of your customized settings (aperture) have limits compared to a Nikon lens.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good product at a reasonable price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product! The only downside is the polaroid picture is the size of a credit card, which is small and not the normal size of polaroid.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s convenient that it folds up, but it s a bit wonky trying to get it closed up. Takes some practice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great minimal bag for sure, (it s smaller than it looks online) but my new Sony a7r mark ii just barely doesn t fit with the Zeiss 1.8 55mm lens attached. Go bigger to the &#34;plus&#34; version of this bag, I think it s the 625.  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything ok until Now !  [END]
[BEGIN] It works  [END]
[BEGIN] Great lens, I forgot that it weighs as much as my 70-200, only shorter, much slower  [END]
[BEGIN] We love our camera and use it daily!  [END]
[BEGIN] works just fine, but the batteries seem to have a short life  [END]
[BEGIN] I wish the slides moved out easier, but other than than it works great for what I need.  [END]
[BEGIN] The lighting might be tough to dial in. I ve had a few that were too dark and one that was too light, but it s a super fun little camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] It looks really cool, works too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Work good, easy to set up (installing your own hard drive). The quality of the video could be better and the user interface isn t the easiest to use but all in all it s ok.  [END]
[BEGIN] received in good order; slightly better capacity than OEM battery with camera  [END]
[BEGIN] Still getting use to this. Wouldn t let me download app to my Iphone but takes great pics  [END]
[BEGIN] A little clumsy to use but overall works very good. I use this with gradient ND filters and it allows me to adjust it to the position I want.  [END]
[BEGIN] The only reason I don t give it five stars is that I ve only had it two days. It charged my four RED Bricks from 0 charge in about four hours. For the price It seems to be great. Great build quality. So fingers crossed that it will last...  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice screen size good viewing angle and pic quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] I got quite a lot for my money, the chest piece is the most used and very very comfortable and steady taking great pics and video with my go Pro 3+  [END]
[BEGIN] Great quality images and optics, was just too heavy for what I wanted to use it for.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect for HDM Z1 CPAP Machine  [END]
[BEGIN] Bought this for my daughters Powershot. Great construction and extra pocket for battery charger  [END]
[BEGIN] Good cheap tripod and selfie stick, but the tripod is wobbly due to the small feet.  [END]
[BEGIN] Have not bought any film in 15 years so my supply of these was eventually exhausted. Very handy for screws and various other small things. The tops take a bit of effort to get off and seem to be better made than the aging Kodak canisters.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great deal  [END]
[BEGIN] I knew what I wanted/needed, saw it, and now have it!  [END]
[BEGIN] Easy to use. Great detail  [END]
[BEGIN] Great camera with plenty of options  [END]
[BEGIN] Not as stable as it looks but overall I am very happy with the purchase. Not bad for this Price.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Pentax X-5 digital camera fits nicely in here, on its side. The pouches are roomy enough for memory cards and batteries. The padding is ample and the camera feels well protected. Overall, a good value.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice camera  [END]
[BEGIN] Good  [END]
[BEGIN] My 6D would not fits because it is too bulky. Smaller cameras would. It does protect your gear.  [END]
[BEGIN] not bad  [END]
[BEGIN] It was pretty easy to set up. Pictures look great. It has some cool transitions and an option to display multiple pics in a collage format. I was looking for a frame that could be hung on wall and display pictures taken as portraits (vertically), versus landscape (horizontally).  [END]
[BEGIN] It s a good case, but I thought it would be much bigger.  [END]
[BEGIN] Like the small size and the strap is really nice compared to the on hand strap following the camera  [END]
[BEGIN] Emailed them for new parts and they replaced the whole unit. Very easy to work with!  [END]
[BEGIN] Easy to carry your camera. Anti slip (grip) is working well.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s not a good  [END]
[BEGIN] For not being a go pro. Takes great pics and video. I got it mostly fir video. Love it for the price  [END]
[BEGIN] great low/mid level camera , bought as a gift, they love it  [END]
[BEGIN] Thanks  [END]
[BEGIN] Seems simple to operate -clear picture. Really haven t used it much yet but always like the quality of Samsung  [END]
[BEGIN] Point and shoot cameras are a must have for surveying and inspections when on the road and this has lasted a long time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome little camera really helpful and fun.  [END]
[BEGIN] looks great on a utility belt, but didn t feel like batman. it receives many filters of varying sizes. decent construction and easy to get stuff in and out of. mounts securely. good thingy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good quality  [END]
[BEGIN] Product arrived as expected  [END]
[BEGIN] Just used it on vacation. Works great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good system Beautiful night vision I say BUY  [END]
[BEGIN] Attached it to a 300mm Nikon and works well for my intended purpose (astro-photography, long distance canyonland shots.  [END]
[BEGIN] work great and very reasonably priced  [END]
[BEGIN] Good  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect for table top 3D scanner application with a small projector and camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] Up graded my gear and camera and this bag holds it all and then some. Awesome bag.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Product for the Price  [END]
[BEGIN] Canon expensive.  [END]
[BEGIN] Adequate cable length  [END]
[BEGIN] The accessories are great, but the case could be larger or designed better. The case will comfortably hold your camera, a couple batteries, and few small accessories. You can jam everything in there but I wouldn t recommend it.  [END]
[BEGIN] camera works well, but the video output requires proprietary editing software to publish  [END]
[BEGIN] For the price, this is an awesome little tripod but it can easily tip over with larger cameras so be careful of that! I ve had a few incidents of my camera flopping over but thankfully wasn t damaged  [END]
[BEGIN] The price was definitely right for this. It helps while taking photographs in bright sunlight, allowing me to have a bit longer exposure and capture vivid landscapes better than previously. The glass is fairly good quality, I will probably buy a stronger one (0.9, etc) in the future!  [END]
[BEGIN] It is what it is  [END]
[BEGIN] Bought it for our vacation at he beach. Loved it, takes great pics, loved having screens on both sides. Was able to get shots while playing around in the water without worrying about ruining the camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] Strap a little thin but it works well  [END]
[BEGIN] Good  [END]
[BEGIN] It fits. Its plastic. It was $2 used. I will not spend $30 on a piece of plastic because it says Canon on it. This does the same thing, just without the expensive logo.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works exactly as it is described. Other reviewers stated it really has an intense rubber smell...they are correct and that is why I only gave it four stars. I will be cutting the rubber off.  [END]
[BEGIN] Its like receiving a bag of goodies. The Case is good and accessories are decent, but for the suction cup holder I will stick with the GO Pro Brand.  [END]
[BEGIN] I work at HD & use them to find product numbers on high storage items. Even with my glasses I can t read the high numbers.  [END]
[BEGIN] OK for me!  [END]
[BEGIN] Works as expected, this is the kind of charger Nikon should have included  [END]
[BEGIN] The tripod is so cheap I would never trust my camera on it. Other then that everything is great. I love the side hand grip, and have recommended it to anyone who will listen! Great product.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great for the price but not real good cameras at night  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice camera, weird user interface, takes some time to get used to, for the price its a nice camera  [END]
[BEGIN] Comfort s quite disappointing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bought this mostly for the air ball.  [END]
[BEGIN] It does the job  [END]
[BEGIN] ... years ago, when I purchased this lens it was the only 300mm option for the GF1 I was using. That aside, I have used it to get some nice, exciting shots of birds that I otherwise would not have. I m very glad I purchased it.  [END]
[BEGIN] great  [END]
[BEGIN] A good battery and charger I purchased for the Panasonic ZS15 .Very good in all this great compact camera  [END]
[BEGIN] Good for messenger bags; not good for typical backpacks. It s wider than expected, but of reasonable quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good  [END]
[BEGIN] Works very well and consistent after you learn to use it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Battery was well priced and delivered on time. However the camcorder it was going to be installed into no longer works. Never used this product. Thanks anyway Amazon  [END]
[BEGIN] Very happy with the camera. Its a must to turn it off or the battery will drain.  [END]
[BEGIN] I didn t really want to add a surveillance device to my security system, but opted for one camera along with motion detectors and sirens. The resolution of this camera is very good but it would warrant five stars if it had a zoom feature and smoother action.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works as expected... It s definitely an affordable option when considering an action camera. Only down side so far is that the screen is a little flimsy.  [END]
[BEGIN] as described  [END]
[BEGIN] My camera fell off in mid air and smashed to the ground.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great, however sometimes the onboard controls seem to take priority to the camera controls. When this happens it is quickly resolved by switching the on/off switch on the battery grip on/off. Definitely not a deal breaker for me, but would be nice if this didn t happen.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked just fine. Interesting video shot from unique perspective. Do you have enough ideas for video to make it worthwhile.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice!  [END]
[BEGIN] I like it  [END]
[BEGIN] Does what it say.  [END]
[BEGIN] Easy to set up and operate. I operate from both the browser website and the Android app. Have set up in two different houses. Seems like good Wi-Fi range. Comes with nice, flat patch cable to hardwire into router for setup.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fast shipping. Vid is grainy at times but for the price it is very a very good cam.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wonderful product for the price. I attached it to a 18mm lens and got some dramatic shots like the one attached to this review. Mind though, that they are a little heavy and bulky, so your zoom lens will look like a tele and weight as much.  [END]
[BEGIN] love the zoom feature for a compact camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works as advertised  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great, looks great. Battery life is decent. Can t see anything in the dark  [END]
[BEGIN] Came with the printer, paper works fine and prints fine. I wish there was a local source so I could get replacements quicker when I need them  [END]
[BEGIN] works well and very affordable  [END]
[BEGIN] I love this as it is very light weight to carry, but with you camera on it, it is kind of unsafe...make sure you have your camera strap around your next just in case it tips over.  [END]
[BEGIN] Handy and easy  [END]
[BEGIN] Careful they dont sent you a 16.1 MP and pass it off as the 20.1 MP....after this happened I complained and got 10$ refunded and kept the camera. The camera is very nice for the $. Point and shoot.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] This does NOT come with the mount, you will need to buy a mount that can fit your flash and also mounts to a bowens mount  [END]
[BEGIN] great, just rec d and have not used. But have never had problem with other tapes before  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product  [END]
[BEGIN] The unit is sturdy--I am still playing around with different configurations  [END]
[BEGIN] I think it was a little too expensive, but it does work well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Takes good photo s and video is decent,battery life is not good drains to fast must carry extra batteries.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just what was needed. Thank you.  [END]
[BEGIN] Prompt delivery and it works like promised. Thanks  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well. No instructions.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have EXTREMELY small wrists, so it can still wiggle around a bit even tightened down on me. However, it s still super useful for many situations and being adjustable, I ve been able to let others use it when filming with my gopro. Glad I purchased.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had some glitches with the ejector for the film but it is overall a really good camera for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] The binoculars worked great. Took my granddaughters to a One Direction concert and our seats were in a higher section but with the Olympus we could see every eye color, smile and dance that the band performed.  [END]
[BEGIN] it s normal  [END]
[BEGIN] Great. Very easy setup  [END]
[BEGIN] great for the price  [END]
[BEGIN] Good Case  [END]
[BEGIN] Arrived in great shape. Although it s a very basic lens it was exactly what was needed for the project.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent device! I would give it 5 stars but it is a pain to have to remove 4 screws just to change the batteries.  [END]
[BEGIN] had to play with it a bit to get it to work the way I expected to but the video is great and I use it now with no issue.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bought some flashes that didn t fit my hot shoe, this works perfectly.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was the same type of a battery I had once before. Worked as expectedly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good  [END]
[BEGIN] very good product  [END]
[BEGIN] Remote works great and very helpful in my learning how to use my camera  [END]
[BEGIN] good mic for the low price  [END]
[BEGIN] everithing OK  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good product to my GoPro.  [END]
[BEGIN] a little bit on the heavy side but sturdy enough to do the job and lighter than a tripod  [END]
[BEGIN] Works Great!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Advice for new parents, your iphone will need to be on ALL the time if you want to keep a constant watch. Otherwise, it s got a really clear picture even in the darkest of situations. Super easy set up.  [END]
[BEGIN] so far its doing great  [END]
[BEGIN] Works fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] So far so good, Camera is sharp enough for close range, IR works great at night. My only beef that kept it at 4 stars is it being a tad slow when you pan around. Other than that its great.  [END]
[BEGIN] I really like it, shipping wasnt bad either  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great and I like it, but it was a little expensive. Also had to pay extra for the articulating mounting arm (which I also like and thought was overpriced).  [END]
[BEGIN] Good optics and works well with my DSLR.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was expecting the entire picture not just the backdrop. Probably will return.  [END]
[BEGIN] performed as advertized  [END]
[BEGIN] Batteries are great! Don t work with cannon chargers but work with the one it came with  [END]
[BEGIN] Its all I need  [END]
[BEGIN] Good deal, easy to use and well worth the money as a refurbished unit( can tell - it looks new).  [END]
[BEGIN] Great long and skinny chealplace for covering a 1/4 20 screw into various 1/4 20 and one 3/4.. I wish it had more 3/4 but what can a guy do? Work for me but might not work in every mounting situation. Do some research before buying.  [END]
[BEGIN] very good  [END]
[BEGIN] Sometimes works, sometimes takes few more seconds, first I thought It was because the camera needed time to focus but realize later the remote sometimes doesn t send signal. Battery draws very fast.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great fit for GH4, does just what it says and what it is suppose to do. I am able to mount Leica R glass to the GH4, which provides some great unique looks to video and photos. Would recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] nice  [END]
[BEGIN] Handy item for carrying and providing easy access to required filters.  [END]
[BEGIN] It does work good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Actually pretty good quality. It was simple to put together, and surprisingly easy to transport.  [END]
[BEGIN] GREAT UNDERWATER CAMERA!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] As long as you realize these are standard def products and they sometimes have issues recording, nobody can beat the price/quality. You wont be disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Looks good feels good, I have taken video through it but haven t used it under water yet. It didn t distort or interfere with the video or pictures at all. I would buy this product again and recommend it to friends.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well. Can t rotate upwards at all though.  [END]
[BEGIN] works fine although battery was real low only 1 bar when I got it but it charged up fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] I really like it. Its everything that i expected. If build quality is a big concern keep in mind that this is a 20 dollar shutter release. Don t expect any more than what your e paying for.  [END]
[BEGIN] The quality is ok, but only 2 axes is a bit of a pain. Not the fault of the seller but I should have paid more attention. Was a good price so I ll find some use for it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Long camera rod. limited adapters. Wish it was made of metal so I can use it as a weapon also for self defense  [END]
[BEGIN] Bought two, only issue was the first one was programmed in Japanese, both work well were not to difficult to install. Have not been able to get the reverse camera to put up the grid in reverse. The directions are rather skimpy.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have used this item several times and great for the money. Durable and sturdy. The only thing that I was not impressed or found challenging was putting it together, but after watching several Youtube views I finally got it. Easy to pack way and comes with convenient carrying case.  [END]
[BEGIN] So far so good!  [END]
[BEGIN] I am pleased with the product so far - it seems to have a good line of vision. Vincent was a great help to get my cameras set up on my wifi network  [END]
[BEGIN] my goddaughter loved her gift  [END]
[BEGIN] Good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nicely made. Some pre-cut foam areas are oddly shaped and GoPro accessories won t fit.  [END]
[BEGIN] it works very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Picture could be a little clearer and instructions should be in larged. Not read the fine print.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome camera  [END]
[BEGIN] Ok but still not the standard fifty  [END]
[BEGIN] Can t beat it for the price!  [END]
[BEGIN] If your GoPro is attached to a selfie stick, you will need to use both floaties. Good stuff!  [END]
[BEGIN] I like it,would like it better if it came with an ac\dc power chord.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works as advertised. I look at the sun daily, if it s out. Only drawback was that the telescope fits very tightly in the case.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great lens! A little distortion though, but has worked well for astrophotography for me on sony a6000  [END]
[BEGIN] Don t crank the head all the way up or it will stick. Other than that, it s great.  [END]
[BEGIN] I think this kit has all the accessories I can use to keep my Pentax K-50 camera clean and in good condition.  [END]
[BEGIN] only one zipper, so they leak a little. i ordered them to hold down soccer PUG s, and they work great for that.  [END]
[BEGIN] Connects my camera to the DVR on my surveillance system. They do the job.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great idea but little pricey. Janeb  [END]
[BEGIN] Turned out to be a little smaller than I was hoping for, but I still love it!! Really only fits my camera with a lens attached and then a second lens.  [END]
[BEGIN] It has high-quality video capabilities but it is not as functional as the FujiKam HD. It is stationary and cannot be moved remotely using the available mobile app.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good quality --better made than most albums at this price. I will buy another one.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does what I need as extra battery power  [END]
[BEGIN] Great delivery time. Work great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not the best, but very usefull!  [END]
[BEGIN] Surprisingly solid.  [END]
[BEGIN] Have taken awesome pictures with it still don t think I have met full potential  [END]
[BEGIN] I do like this product. My only complaint is that the straps could be a little bit longer. It works as advertised, keeping the camera stable at your side. It is much, much better than your typical neck strap.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room for everything  [END]
[BEGIN] this is a great case. i wish the leather looked a little more weathered. it s a little plastic like look but it s ok. hopefully it wears out a little to give it a cooler older look.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good size and light weight, the zipper tag did rip making the zipper only 3/4 to close the bag.  [END]
[BEGIN] Needs a carry case. Works great even though color temp should be 5500 instead of 5400. It s still a little green. Not a problem with white balance.  [END]
[BEGIN] Filters worked great in 20-40 feet of water. I don t have experience with other filters but it was much better than no filter at all. We slipped the filter on after submerging to prevent bubbles.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really good definition and practic.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small and effecient. Foot adhesive was a bit frail. One of the feet pulled off.  [END]
[BEGIN] The only thing that I am a little disapointed in is that it is not fully waterproof. Thanks for your quick delivery Vic Sheahan  [END]
[BEGIN] Much larger and bulkier than the Nikon version.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good unit at the right price. Make certain the focal plane is absolutely vertical, and you will yield great results.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good case  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a very sturdy and useful mount. I use it frequently in the shoulder position. I m impressed at its stability. It s a very clever and flexible design and has encouraged more frequent usage of my Action Cam.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great, much better pic than the cheap one I had before, I need to get the second one installed out back real soon.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything was as stated and good quality for a great price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good  [END]
[BEGIN] love it!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I own Lion Security Specialist Inc.to compete i look for great values and this was one, thank you Amazon.  [END]
[BEGIN] Feels cheap but its works fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like this tripod for what i need it for which is not every day use. Its definitely sturdy for my camera. Only complaint the quick release plate had a piece fall off of it the first day. But i am pretty happy with it  [END]
[BEGIN] Not too bad for the price  [END]
[BEGIN] We got these for the father-in-law who misplaced the charger for his camera. This package with two additional batteries was the perfect answer to prepare the father-in-law with everything he needed for a week long trip to the National Parks.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just as described.  [END]
[BEGIN] works fine but found the lost one two hours after i ordered this one  [END]
[BEGIN] good value, it supports my heavy 20-60 x 80mm Vortex Viper spotting scope well. A product really has to knock my socks off to get a 5 star  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great Extra one in case I lose the first one  [END]
[BEGIN] It s very nice, works well  [END]
[BEGIN] Feels big and cheap, especially compared to the OEM charger, but it works.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works good! got it set up in no time.  [END]
[BEGIN] it works.  [END]
[BEGIN] as described.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good Value for a case. the foam is easy to use and customize. quality is not premium, but it is quite good and good enough for most uses.  [END]
[BEGIN] I happy with it. Just wish it had a rechargeable battery.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product that fits perfectly onto my stands that I use for video and photography. A little on the cheaper side but still gets the job done nonetheless. Holds my flashes just fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fantastic product. It feels like part of the camera. I should have picked the darker leather, but that s my fault.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great camera, has everything I need to get started. This is my first DSLR and I find it quite easy to use.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great batteries to get for great price but those batteries drain little faster than original go pro hero battery. 4.5/5  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect fit  [END]
[BEGIN] Have not had to use it but glad I purchased it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good camera  [END]
[BEGIN] Great. Just wished the voice and speaker sound was better.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fast shipping and exactly as described  [END]
[BEGIN] Gave me plenty of back up  [END]
[BEGIN] Great strap for my Fuji XPro1. Really don t use the bag.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked great. Nothings perfect, but it works. The stem that goes into battery insert in the camera, seems a little fragile. Handle with care. Overall, good product. Glad I purchased it, lasted a lot longer since I use my 70D for video.  [END]
[BEGIN] I received the go pro lcd + for Father s Day I purchased this after some legwork on Amazon I am very happy with this product and feel confident that my gopro will remain safe and secure even though this is not an exact fit for it  [END]
[BEGIN] The camera is very good. Easy to operate and takes great pics. The added accessory is junk.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just your normal battery charger. Nothing exciting.  [END]
[BEGIN] Almost all you need to work with an action camera  [END]
[BEGIN] Loved the camera, accessories where a waste: oversized bag and tripod the holder for the SDs , etc ... prefer accessories that match the product like smaller case, helmet or wrist mounts, etc  [END]
[BEGIN] Good little ball head. Nothing amazing, but it works and it s a good deal.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good Batteries, better than other brands with higher amp hour.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great case for the price why waste your money on a name brand one.  [END]
[BEGIN] Looks ok  [END]
[BEGIN] These work as stated but if you use large CFL bulbs for photography you need to take caution when screwing them in. The sockets are barely strong enough to support the weight of such larger bulbs.  [END]
[BEGIN] Easy to install. Easy on and off. Good product  [END]
[BEGIN] Compact, easy to use, has extra features, and takes great pictures.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s a great camera pictures are great even when all the way zoomed in they are still pretty good.In low light it s also good all of my low light pictures turn out good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Exactly what I needed, much longer than the original which is helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] ok  [END]
[BEGIN] Not hard to use at all, simple entry level light meter. This was a great purchase for a photography student like myself, and it fits nicely into the camera bag which is always appreciated.  [END]
[BEGIN] A perfect match and fit. I am very happy with the purchase  [END]
[BEGIN] I am happy with this purchase, !!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great case for the money. Refill foam is available, which is great if you change your usage. Solid hard case.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great  [END]
[BEGIN] asdf  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked very well for gift to elderly parents. All they have to do is sit back and watch the photos. Only lacking star as user interface is clunky. And no notification provided to new account that can add photos by email  [END]
[BEGIN] Works good. It could use a better manual.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works best for skin response. Works fine but instructions are hard to understand. .and even locate oniine..  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Product  [END]
[BEGIN] Great gift I gave my dad. The only thing is the tripod is a bit smaller than expected. Like that every fits in the case!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good, thanks so much  [END]
[BEGIN] Batteries delivered very quickly and as described. Work well in my Nikon D5200 camera. Price was great for two.  [END]
[BEGIN] Received cables in a timely manner ( thank you ) replaced it with my 4 camera splitter and have no problems still.  [END]
[BEGIN] love the space perfect size. Tight to work with, getting in and out. stiff zipper. hope it will soften with use.  [END]
[BEGIN] It does exactly what is suppose to, not to mention it s pretty sleek.  [END]
[BEGIN] Accidentally threw out the original charger for my camera so I had to buy this one. It works well so far.  [END]
[BEGIN] While it is cheaper that the Nikon version, and has an internal battery which is nice, it is bulky.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked well!  [END]
[BEGIN] 2nd one I bought. I think the bag that it comes in has gotten a little better quality  [END]
[BEGIN] These are adequate. Not as thin as the better pieces, but does the job. Good value.  [END]
[BEGIN] This camera has a nice clear picture.  [END]
[BEGIN] You can never have too many mounts for your Go Pro.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have used this camera for the last 3 weeks in a Swimming Pool and at the Sea and It works great!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Helps extend recording time on the device without too much added mass. The small batteries in the GoPro Hero 4 are a joke so you really need to get this if you are planning to record for any length of time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Last a little longer than the stock battery.  [END]
[BEGIN] Where can I get info on how to program this device?  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good camera!  [END]
[BEGIN] The t5i is a great camera. Nice features and no issues with it yet. I bought the bundle primarily for the extra lens and included SD card. The case, tripod, wide angle lens, and filters are passable but not great. The value of this set is worth the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] It works well for the money. The charge was a little less than I had hoped for.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fairly good for the price! Sometimes it takes a little bit to take the pictures but then once it finally connects works good! Perfect for a beginner.  [END]
[BEGIN] Product works as advertised.  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect product, great price. Not too big to take on outings and it is durable. Plenty of storage. Highly recommended!  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well for carrying our Sony HandyCam and accessories. Not a lot of extra room, but probably enough. Seems to be quality-made and should last.  [END]
[BEGIN] Item arrived on time. I m happy with this product  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good softbox, great price!  [END]
[BEGIN] Battery dead in 45 min.  [END]
[BEGIN] decent  [END]
[BEGIN] Need to firmly tight...even after tight...it gets loose...so need to find the right position to place this arm and supporting device...  [END]
[BEGIN] Very handy and everything I expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have a small camera that I travel with and it fits in this case very snugly. It seems to be enough protection while in my luggage, from clanging into other hard surfaces.  [END]
[BEGIN] I ve learned a lot about my camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] as described... work well  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice camera, but needed a memory card. This was a separate purchase and delayed camera use.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love the camera but it is missing a very important attachment piece. I can t use any attachments because one screw is missing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good price, I think the quality of the picture are fair. I was very happy with the results.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like it  [END]
[BEGIN] Comfortable sturdy strap but hard to get used to how my camera hangs.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great camera but far too complicated for a 73 year old man such as me.  [END]
[BEGIN] The adapter ring does not come with the filter retaining ring so another adapter ring has to be used to hold the filter on the camera lens. It holds the filter on the camera lens as per it s purpose.  [END]
[BEGIN] pretty good camera  [END]
[BEGIN] The hood is OK. But when removing from camera it comes off together with the protective lens.  [END]
[BEGIN] I used the narrative to clip to capture moments with my family all over Japan and came back with many deeply satisfyingly memories that I couldn t have preserved any other way.  [END]
[BEGIN] Battery  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice! just was what i needed. it is made well and works to keep all the parts in one place. thank you!  [END]
[BEGIN] The only problem was the host of extra charges that added over 15% to the first cost of $74.99 so that the total first cost to me was really $87.23.  [END]
[BEGIN] The only complaint is that the lens hood is very loose. The lens is wide and sharp.  [END]
[BEGIN] AMAZING for the price. I mean it, you won t find a better reflector out there for this price  [END]
[BEGIN] These work fine and the car charger is very convenient. However, they last about half as long as the original camera battery. It s not a big deal if you always have a spare fully charged battery, but carrying multiple batteries around on vacation gets tiresome.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s a battery  [END]
[BEGIN] excellent product, arrived on time, works great. i would purchase from this merchant again.very happy with this product, would recommend it to friends.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fine product fair price  [END]
[BEGIN] Fits pretty good. No hanging edges of the ends of the screen so the cover won t pill off easily.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice !  [END]
[BEGIN] good quality and both the car and home chargers are handy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Charged up nice. No problems!  [END]
[BEGIN] Really helps with underwater color. Stayed on the camera without a problem. Cotton safety string that catches lens in case the lens falls off the camera is flimsy and broke quickly. Will need to replace with nylon fishing line.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good quality  [END]
[BEGIN] It s a good starter to get you used to your GoPro and a lot of the accessories. Would definitely be considering upgrading after you have gotten use to them.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fits!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] works well and secure all though sits a little low but works ok. Thanks!  [END]
[BEGIN] It installs and operates quickly and without issues. The jumper to set the sensitivity is explained well. One thing I noticed, it does not seem to act as a repeater for the Z-wave signal. Is there a way to force it into repeater mode?  [END]
[BEGIN] Works just liked it s supposed to.  [END]
[BEGIN] To use as a wrist strap, opening larger than we thought.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good  [END]
[BEGIN] This has been a great little speedlight. My only complaint is that the batteries drain VERY quickly. It uses 4 AAs at a time. I have gotten in the habit of carrying spares with me, but batteries are not cheap. Overall, it s a good product.  [END]
[BEGIN] I did not buy it.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have taken photos in complete dark with my Nikon D5500. Photos are very good and i have observed that intensity of flash is not varying with depending upon the darkness  [END]
[BEGIN] a little flamzy .but works loks like some parts may begin to give up soon  [END]
[BEGIN] Love my gadgets thank you  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this lens. Good build quality. The pictures I take come out very good. Buy a lens filter for it.  [END]
[BEGIN] I took it on vacation. It is very light. It is very strong. It is very stable.  [END]
[BEGIN] It works as it should  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good for the price. Takes a little time to get the cover on the camera. I wish there was some kind of instruction guide though. I could be doing this entirely wrong.  [END]
[BEGIN] love everything especially the bag and head mount, however the gopole is really flimsy and i ended up buying a real gopole. but you cant beat it for the price!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice little bench top tripod - reasonably stable with camera and close up lens attached.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great  [END]
[BEGIN] The filter doesn t fit into my P Series holder, but works if I hold it up in front of the camera. Love the cool effects.  [END]
[BEGIN] For the price, it can t be beat. Since I already owned three of them when I ordered this one, that should speak for itself.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well! This case had enough room for me to store my camera as well as the charging cord.  [END]
[BEGIN] Battery seems to have trouble linking up to the Leica charger. I finally got it to charge and looks as though it charged fully.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works as advertised  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great  [END]
[BEGIN] Okay for the price ... It had oil or something weird on it when I got it: It s pretty sturdy, though I d suggest finding something better if you have money to spend.  [END]
[BEGIN] pros. easy setup, provided e-mail uploads. multi cloud service connectable dropbox. picasa. etc. motion sensor on/off cons. TN pannel. can t hanging - no wall mount hole.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s good, but hard to keep fixed in the right position.  [END]
[BEGIN] As expected  [END]
[BEGIN] works great just be careful taking ur phone out as my first one broke like this but other then that works as its supposed to will recoomend to others  [END]
[BEGIN] Received by USPS and it is decoded as it charges using Olympus Charger BCN1. Non decoded battery do not charge on this device.  [END]
[BEGIN] work wonderfully they are able to charge in the official Nikon charger that came with my camera D3200 and provide the same photo time  [END]
[BEGIN] I bought this to monitor my Whole House Humidification system in attic after a bad experience with a leak. It was a little difficult to set up but support was superior to others and works fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] Im happy with this monopod, perhaps looking back I might have spent the money on a really sturdy dedicated video tripod..... As getting perfectly still shots is still a little tricky with this. The S6 head is great!  [END]
[BEGIN] works as expected  [END]
[BEGIN] Good product!  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great. Cant beat the price. It was exactly what I was looking for.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is a little loose on the gopro, but holds it secure enough. The camera can still slide a small amount in it, but it hasn t fallen out of it yet. It would be nice if there were a way to tighten it more.  [END]
[BEGIN] It works well with my Pentax K-50 DSLR camera; now I will not be worry if the camera battery becomes discharged.  [END]
[BEGIN] Work as expected. Really fun to use.  [END]
[BEGIN] The product works well as claimed.  [END]
[BEGIN] The product is very good. Have had it for about a year now and has worked well. Had to abandon the Comcast router for another to keep the cameras from dropping out constantly. Picture quality could be better, the HD cameras might be the way to go. Hope this helps.  [END]
[BEGIN] As expected  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good  [END]
[BEGIN] Good price compared to battery stores  [END]
[BEGIN] just ok  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice kit and well built except for the &#34;selfy stick&#34;.  [END]
[BEGIN] The camera is surpsingly small and excelent recording with good sound quality  [END]
[BEGIN] Good camera easy to Operate The remote is not that great interfere with the TV if you have Samsung and accessories are not that strong I already had two broke Camera video quality is great  [END]
[BEGIN] Would have been better if you could see the picture you want to take through the camera, The case blocks your viewing ability.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the easy of start up & using this camera having never had one prior. wish we would have got an upgraded model to view video directly on camera. works great; used biking, hiking, rappelling & in ocean.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty much what you d expect. Works fine, not elegant construction, ask me in a year how sturdy it is.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent product and accessories.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good product, great deal for the money i pay,  [END]
[BEGIN] Purchased this during Amazon s anniversary sale. Works as intended, it seems to be well built out of some solid plastic. I ll trust that it will hold my camera just fine. It s not the greatest stabilization, but way better than just hand holding the camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was no problem to use or appearance.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excelent product  [END]
[BEGIN] Good scope. Easy to set up and use. Better optics then the price would suggest.  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect match !  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect  [END]
[BEGIN] The charger came in ahead of promised date and was as advertised  [END]
[BEGIN] Added some life to a laptop we were ready to toss out. Fits perfectly and seems to hold a charge reasonably well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Seems to be working fine  [END]
[BEGIN] Great camera for a beginner like me :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Look real and your nosey neighbors will look like dummies!  [END]
[BEGIN] Mainly plastic but it does hold a small camera on a bike very well. Does the job.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good  [END]
[BEGIN] Good color, great wide angle view, it worth the money!  [END]
[BEGIN] Got all my solar lights going again without costing a fortune.  [END]
[BEGIN] This camera works pretty good  [END]
[BEGIN] Good cleaning cloth for my glasses. It does require hand-wash which maintains it.  [END]
[BEGIN] really pretty good....  [END]
[BEGIN] Would have given it a five star review after the first handful of wearing. Only four one as it is not quite as effective but still helps.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice product. Liked it a lot.  [END]
[BEGIN] Handy, but the clip broke from me picking it up without even touching the clip... But I ll cut it some slack for the low price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Charger and batteries work great!  [END]
[BEGIN] I love the camera, it gives me great pictures, many choices and easy to use.  [END]
[BEGIN] small compact, only negative is the center column, Worked great with it down and a good ball head. I am 5 5 so the center column was down most of the time. I liked the retractable spike in the feet.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well except the light is substandard.  [END]
[BEGIN] Charger works great.. on occasion it will report that one battery isn t fully charged, but when you remove the &#34;full&#34; battery, the other then immediately reports as being full. Good enough.  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera is easy to use but a lot of that power goes to waste when you cant process RAW images...Canon s web site blows when it comes to downloading codec.  [END]
[BEGIN] seem to work great.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the best values you ll find in a camera accessory of its type but be prepared for sparse and poorly written instruction that truly have to be read with a magnifier.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great  [END]
[BEGIN] helps with my photo work  [END]
[BEGIN] great seller,nice product,for now it works well  [END]
[BEGIN] It does mostly what I want. It takes some figuring out but if you read the Q&A below it s doable. Still trying to figure out how to set the time, but for what you pay, it s pretty damn good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just got mine today it feels good in the head but never tried and water oh and plus the wrist strap is too small and is weird  [END]
[BEGIN] I am happy about this battery. Works good. Thanks...  [END]
[BEGIN] Purchased without a hitch, but never was able to register as the camera I purchased this for was a poor quality camera that arrived damaged and was returned.  [END]
[BEGIN] The charger works well, but very disappointed that caps are not on the batteries in order to prevent them from shorting out in camera bag. I liked the tripod and cleaning kit that came with it, however the battery caps are more important.  [END]
[BEGIN] Product received undamaged and works as expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice camera for it size and cost  [END]
[BEGIN] Working good but not very easy to install on flash. Size for standard size (not small) flashes only.  [END]
[BEGIN] rec d as promised and as advertised  [END]
[BEGIN] Good enough for me. I haven t used the Nikon or Sigma wide angles so I can t compare, but this one has F/2.8, good autofocus and is wide enough for interiors and landscape.  [END]
[BEGIN] Solidly built. Haven t figured the LCD display yet. The remote is line-of-sight, if you re off by a couple of degrees it won t work.  [END]
[BEGIN] bought it as a gift ...need an accessories bag for all the stuff!  [END]
[BEGIN] WIFI is iffy, would be better with Bluetooth or screen mirroring technology. Hard to use if you have large hands.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good  [END]
[BEGIN] Good product. Very happy with purchase.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very hard to pull the spring open to fit my phone in it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Used on Alaska cruise. Very satisfied.  [END]
[BEGIN] good price  [END]
[BEGIN] Love it! It would be five stars if it had longer battery life. Tons of great functions, apps and more... My best camera ever!  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent quality. The best part is that most of these items are small and easy to put into your camera bag without taking up too much space.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked great with our Intvo a camera. We dove at Key Largo, Florida and recommended the floats after a fellow diver dropped his GoPro while climbing back into the boat.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice lol gadget  [END]
[BEGIN] Good product for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fits all my stuff, just a couple inches more would have made it great.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is more than I expected  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product works with my mobile phone remotely great just wish it was HD  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great. i might have to get another one.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great!! Unfortunately, it doesn t come with the &#34;J-Hook&#34; so you can mount your Go Pro Camera. (I have a Go Pro 2) Not a big deal though. There are plenty of places that sell it on Amazon. Fast shipping. Good pprice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works just as described by others. See the Flickr pool for this lens for examples of what it can/cannot do.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like this product and will buy again.  [END]
[BEGIN] These are pretty cool, great picture, easy install. The toggle adjustment switch was just a little problem getting into 1/2 conduit sleeve to hide in gang box outside. Otherwise, happy with purchase!  [END]
[BEGIN] Thank you!  [END]
[BEGIN] so far, so good. came very fast.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good camera system  [END]
[BEGIN] Haven t had to use it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fits fine on a my Fujifilm pancake lens.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good camera for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very well made for the price. Panning is very smooth because they have added grease to it which you can see and slightly hear when panning but that is fine with me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Unit does what it was designed to do and I like it a lot. Was a bit disappointing with how weak the edge support is, but overall works fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] Premium price for a good product. I bought the lanyard kit to hold this unit. I feel a fair price would have included the lanyard/ mounting kit.  [END]
[BEGIN] helpful  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice and easy to use  [END]
[BEGIN] Very useful. A little less on the product material quality but for thw price, it is totally reasonable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good product just have to be careful will fall off some belt loops  [END]
[BEGIN] Great functional product but overpriced.  [END]
[BEGIN] Product was as advertised.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good item.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good case, wheels work well, zipper a little sticky in one spot but will work itself out I trust. Not a ton of padding or weight, perfect for stands, sliders and tripods.  [END]
[BEGIN] It reflects very well.  [END]
[BEGIN] good stuff  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty rad deal for a great starter pack. Works well and does what it s supposed to do. Recommended. :^)  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Product  [END]
[BEGIN] unit arrived with loose plastic pieces inside. I had to take cover off to discover what was moving aro0und inside.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent package. Coming from a Canon to pro Nikon is proving to be challenging.Having trouble with misfires when taking photos  [END]
[BEGIN] Takes great photos - nothing spectacular - but brought this camera with my on a trip to Venice Italy. Did the trick and if I lost it on my travels it would have been no big deal. My keepsake photos from the trip are gorgeous.  [END]
[BEGIN] worked for my basic needs  [END]
[BEGIN] I love this camera pictures are excellent I love my purchase.  [END]
[BEGIN] Forgot this back in my hotel room so I have yet to field test. Seems to be a quality product so far.  [END]
[BEGIN] I needed a mount that can support a gopro or contour when recording video while driving and this head exceeded my expectation. I was also able to use a Sony A6000 attached to this ball head without fear of the camera coming off the mount while driving.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well. As noted previously, a little blurry around the edges.  [END]
[BEGIN] One notch too expensive (99$US), but its the only show in town that works snug and solid for the lenses used here. Using this with a SONY A7 and things function as well. The lenses work manually fyi those who might not know.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good camera just a bit hard to edit the file format.  [END]
[BEGIN] work ok for my CCTV cams  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Product  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a great little camera. The LCD makes it easy to see what you are doing. Only big issues are the battery life, but you can buy a battery pack and double the time. It is fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] I think this is really solid, I used it on my vlog - you can see footage of it in use, even underwater: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl-lKaFfe4I  [END]
[BEGIN] a pretty good case. I love it.  [END]
[BEGIN] good pics, but didn t realize unitl I received it that it required AA batteries. As result, it doesn t last long with constant use.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great little camera, the only thing I do not like is it sends an alert every time there is moment in the room, however by the time I receive the alert, there is nothing in the room anymore. Trying to get this fixed.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love them they are very nice  [END]
[BEGIN] bought it and the problem moved away  [END]
[BEGIN] Slim profile. 60mm+ length is ideal for vertical orientation support. Well machined surface and contours. Construction seems robust enough. A great value when compared to similar QR plates costing 2 to 3x more.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works Fine  [END]
[BEGIN] Bought a used Nikon Coolpix S3600 to replace a broken point-and-shoot. Picture quality and features are excellent for a point-and-shoot. The only negative I ve found so far is that battery life is average compared to other battery packs for other cameras that I own.  [END]
[BEGIN] Big bag - holds all my gear with room left over. Seems sturdy enough!  [END]
[BEGIN] I really liked the camara  [END]
[BEGIN] Works fine The battery that came with camera didn t last very long at all. but now I can charge and has a long life.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent camera for the price takes great pictures!  [END]
[BEGIN] I like the camera but didn t came if a book to show me how run the camera plus itthought it came with a card.  [END]
[BEGIN] A very sturdy, lightweight tripod that works best with smaller cameras, and easy to operate.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice bag  [END]
[BEGIN] Delivery was really fast and the lens seems to work great, but it was not clean and that is the only drawback. 4 out of 5 stars! Thanks!  [END]
[BEGIN] Convenient way to clean your keyboard. Seems to be pretty effective, at least compared to compressed air. I haven t compared them directly, so I can t say for certain, but this seems to get the job done.  [END]
[BEGIN] good product. design needs improvement already broke one trying to unattached it.  [END]
[BEGIN] it did the job as decribed  [END]
[BEGIN] Looks like a nice product but the (3-D) part is a stretch. Just a raised bump around the edge from die cutting it. I needed something thicker  [END]
[BEGIN] Zipper pull was off when it arrived and it is VERY small. I should have gotten the medium size. But this is good for taking a limited amount of accessories.  [END]
[BEGIN] Serves the purpose well. UV cleans relatively easily. CP without distortion but not particularly smooth and a bit touchy to screw on. Haven t used the ND yet. Overall very good for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great assortment of accessories for Go Pro at a good price. Way cheaper than buying separately.  [END]
[BEGIN] These are awesome. They slide a little rough and occasionally get stuck, but if you have patience, they are well worth the money. If you re just doing a bit of macro shots, don t buy the expensive stuff. These work just fine!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very quick delivery and easy to set up.  [END]
[BEGIN] wrist strap came off  [END]
[BEGIN] Very, very good picture--but a bit slow  [END]
[BEGIN] bit small...but works  [END]
[BEGIN] Very convenience, but the sound is terrible  [END]
[BEGIN] Solid! A few people complained about set up etc but I think this ting is just phenomenal! I am SUPER happy with the purchase to the point that I keep it in my trunk along with my lights at all times! No extra weight or stand bags needed!  [END]
[BEGIN] I tried several different types of straps and the head strap seems to work the best. The only downside is that when I take it off, I end up with unsightly &#34;GoPro&#34; hair.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really like this kit, but I would prefer for the flat pen to be squared or in triangle shaped as it would do a better job when cleaning both the viewfinder and the LCD screen. Other than that, perfect.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does the job, creates some great photos. Only reason its not a 5 is because I have a b and w  [END]
[BEGIN] Good Product Works as expected  [END]
[BEGIN] Ok seems a bit flimsy..but ok for the cost...good number of pockets...  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good for multiple attachments and rigs. Screw slightly loosens easily no matter how tight you make it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice  [END]
[BEGIN] I love the Binocular, but what is up with the stupid rain guard on these things? Come on Nikon, it cant cost you that much to include a rain guard that fits. Bought a vortex rain guard and it fits nicely. Everything else is gravy  [END]
[BEGIN] Using in Costa Rica now! Great solution to running out of power in the middle of fun.  [END]
[BEGIN] Geat so far. I m glad I bought it.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a good point and shoot camera for basic needs. There aren t a lot of controls on it, but it does take rather nice pictures. Recommended for simple photography situations that don t call for the need to adjust every last setting.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works good with my Nikon camera!  [END]
[BEGIN] Not bad for the price, so far works ok  [END]
[BEGIN] Thanks for the fast shipping and they are so real looking. The only thing is they don t blink red except when I first put them up. I put new batteries in each one also.  [END]
[BEGIN] The camera overall produced excellent pictures and excellent video quality. I don t recommend people with really shaky hands to handle this camera though- Other than that- The price matches the value and I m happy overall with my purchase.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great  [END]
[BEGIN] god  [END]
[BEGIN] Good value for a versatile mid-range zoom, complements the Nikkor 18-55mm found in many bundles. Autofocus can be a little slow, but it s fast enough for my general usage.  [END]
[BEGIN] I can fit three of these stands in a normal-sized suitcases and still have room for clothes. They are very light and fairly durable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works very well and arrived quicker than expected  [END]
[BEGIN] works  [END]
[BEGIN] Very satisfied.  [END]
[BEGIN] exactly as expected. Wish the body was a little nicer as I would like to do some star shooting but a great first DSLR with lots of accessories.  [END]
[BEGIN] At the price range, it is a very good deal.  [END]
[BEGIN] Workable for the price. Never be a rock but a decent stone. Any less than a hundred bucks!  [END]
[BEGIN] Used this on a photo tour works very well to keep your free  [END]
[BEGIN] Fits great over the UV filter that comes with the Phantom, much easier to put on than the gimbal lock provided by DJI. Note: if you are using PolarPro filters, this cap will not fit.  [END]
[BEGIN] It will be great if it can also hold the phone in a vertical way  [END]
[BEGIN] Great camera, the only problem is you can t see the recorded videos on it without an external device. The strap is garbage it doesn t stay on arm or hand.  [END]
[BEGIN] pricey but still ok  [END]
[BEGIN] Not a bad setup for the price cameras are pretty good but seem to get a little blurry at a distance of 40 feet but overall system is good for the price  [END]
[BEGIN] Good quality  [END]
[BEGIN] Rear view mirror is dark. Can use a clearer mirror. Needs a better rewind feature to see previous recording.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great off camera flash cord. It takes a little effort to install at the flash and camera ends so thst they are pushed all the way into position and locked  [END]
[BEGIN] Very simple to install and operate, cameras are not very clear at night time.  [END]
[BEGIN] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5P26ImmSzI  [END]
[BEGIN] It works as expected. Cheap and good value  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect for the office. I especially like the calendar, no more paper calendar pinned on my cubicle wall  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good set to get started with some studio photography. Items came as described and everything assembled and worked well. I like the carrying case for the bulbs and the umbrellas. It would be nice to have something similar for the stands.  [END]
[BEGIN] Alright quality but very very cute  [END]
[BEGIN] A great little camera, but the menus can be very difficult. Once mastered, and set the way you want it, the camera is excellent.  [END]
[BEGIN] Was a gift.  [END]
[BEGIN] They seem to run down fast, but there s 10 of them!  [END]
[BEGIN] A little bulky but does the job great, doesn t feel like it s going to come undone at all!  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great, but the picture may be misleading. It only comes with the 18&#34;, and not the set of 5 which is on the photo.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does what it should, notify me if someone enters house while we are asleep. Would be nice if the arm/disarm was quieter, but can t expect that for the price. Covers a wide area and triggers over 30 away (max distance across room, could trigger further but could not test).  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice tripod for the $.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great with my lenses as stated by others when fully expanded and shorter lenses zoomed out it will show up in your shot just collapse to second or 3rd depth and should be fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] it works very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Using for external battery/charger for iPad/phone.. Just fits.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like this camera but use something else for night photos.  [END]
[BEGIN] A gift-what was requested.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice scope, though the tripod doesn t hold the weight of the scope and is useless. Otherwise it s a nice setup.  [END]
[BEGIN] This enclosure has a nice finish and strong construction.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty cool lens, great value for the price. Couldn t believe it actually had metal mount!  [END]
[BEGIN] the design is cute, I just wish taking it out and putting it back in was easier since i have to take it out to check the amount of film i have left and to replace the film and batteries.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great and I got them at a discount compared to local stores.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is the perfect tripod for carrying inside my small camera bad. It opens and collapsed easily but locks into position when the legs are extended and given a small twist.  [END]
[BEGIN] Is it a nikon battery? NO. Could I tell the difference? Not really.. I am skeptical of off brand batteries but this one is just like OE, for 1/3 price. Used in D800, and performance was comparable/identical to nikon batt.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good Deal!  [END]
[BEGIN] As others say, rubber on product smells like toxic waste, after washing ten times, spraying it with armour all, I can stand it. Nice product if it were less toxic.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good camera strap with the ability to quickly disconnect the strap from the camera. Just what i needed. Good quality at a very good price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not a bad deal.  [END]
[BEGIN] Super helpful! Used it for my camera and sure enough, works great! :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Holding up well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera still doesn t work. Don t know if it s the cable or camera  [END]
[BEGIN] Easy to use; good pictures  [END]
[BEGIN] Works as expected, and much cheaper than the GoPro brand one. I only wish it somehow floated right side up...  [END]
[BEGIN] product as advertised.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent Product.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love this flash. So excited to finally own one.  [END]
[BEGIN] The selfie pole is flimsy but overall there are plenty of attachments for great angles.  [END]
[BEGIN] Allows me to charge three battries at once when I use the power adapter. If I try to just use USB - will only charge two.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really like the camera, the lense size is double what we expected. Picture and video quality is amazing. Very confused by the fact it s made for European outlets though.  [END]
[BEGIN] This camera has served me well for a long time. I would recommend it to anyone wanting a good quality, no nonsense camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good quality, I m pleased.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Value!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great for the price!  [END]
[BEGIN] LOVE LOVE LOVE!! Camera is Excellent and my husband loves it all!!  [END]
[BEGIN] The underwater pictures are better than those that are not. Resolution is low - but bought it for them to rough around with. Will buy nicer one when they are a bit more gentle with these things.  [END]
[BEGIN] Purchased this as a gift and the person loves it!  [END]
[BEGIN] Works very well makes it handy to do angled shots.  [END]
[BEGIN] Charger works great and is simple to use.  [END]
[BEGIN] Higher capacity than original battery, and support all functions. Charged it fully, so lets see how long it can last and hold a charge.  [END]
[BEGIN] The lens is pretty darn good. Almost the only one you d ever need considering the iso range available on the unit. Still figuring out the rest of the settings  [END]
[BEGIN] Straight from the mother land (China)  [END]
[BEGIN] very nice, I bought it to have in different places in my house car and my husband took few to his office i just wish they were a bit bigger.  [END]
[BEGIN] Gave this as a gift for a fellow photographer. She loved it! I wonder if this name brand is as good as the other manufacturers...  [END]
[BEGIN] ok  [END]
[BEGIN] Exactly as advertised  [END]
[BEGIN] Looks like the real deal. Love it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Seems to work perfectly with the Lee Holder and my 105 mm polarizer. Good quality, and while it costs much less than the Lee, it is still overpriced. Lee products, but especially their accessories, are CRAZY expensive.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very easy to use and takes terrific pictures  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a great value if you need to record a long segment. It s crazy that it even comes with a cigarette adapter, which I doubt I ll use.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Camera, bought for my 12 year budding photo journalist. She can t wait for school to start so she can help with the school yearbook.  [END]
[BEGIN] The housing can go with thwe other compllement for the tripod  [END]
[BEGIN] Works as described  [END]
[BEGIN] Works as promised  [END]
[BEGIN] great product. I d rather it had a len protector included.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice lighting.  [END]
[BEGIN] Like it for a small bag.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love it however it is a little bit tricky to get off.  [END]
[BEGIN] The case itself is quite small. I had expected a bit larger. But it does hold my enough gear for my ski or boat bag. Pros: good construction, enough space for some gear Come: quite small If you need a small gopro session case this is for you!  [END]
[BEGIN] It was just what I expected and needed  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything it s supposed to be  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great with my Panasonic HC-W850K Digital HD Camcorder  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice quality especially for the price. Would definitely buy other colors.  [END]
[BEGIN] It cant be support a big camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] so far it has worked as expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice camera!! I m very happy with my camera and the teleobjective of 300mm but the rest of the material is not worth it, the quality is bad.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had an odor but is a great deal and great way to keep camera safe.  [END]
[BEGIN] great tone, still tryung to find the right spot for it  [END]
[BEGIN] Cameras arrived w/out any damage since it was packaged properly. Had problems setting 3 cameras wireless. DLink support was fantastic. Wait time was less than 5 mins. DLink support ( C6720565-AR004231, AR004207,AR004208) walked me thru the wireless setup.  [END]
[BEGIN] I found this macro rail to be very well built, especially for the price point. movement is smooth and precise. I m quite happy with the purchase.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good  [END]
[BEGIN] Good  [END]
[BEGIN] For the incredibly low price it is hard to complain but the product definitely feels like it costs- cheap.  [END]
[BEGIN] A bit smaller than I would ve liked, but it s well made. Good for short photography trips!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great for transferring your pictures to your phone and sharing on social media on the spot but just a heads up, if you shoot in raw the file sizes are large and can take a few minutes to transfer.  [END]
[BEGIN] it works, but not compatible with mine.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good value for money, good quality  [END]
[BEGIN] So much fun to use for guests!  [END]
[BEGIN] The gentleman who received this as a gift is quite happy!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good replacement battery  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice little scanner for your old paper snapshots. The feed-through design and on-board storage make it easy to handle a large number of photos rapidly. It s a really good solution for those simply wanting to create a digital photo album.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great battery and dual charger combination for the price. So far, the batteries have been decent on run times, and the dual charger makes charging much faster than the single unit that came with the camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] I use this quite often, works well especially for the price....  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera is great but software that comes with it does not work. Took me several hours to get it to work  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheap, but maybe deters the homeless.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice bag Bought this for my new Canon DSL with extra lens. Has room for extra batteries, battery charger, manual. Includes shoulder strap and has good padding and divider to keep equipment from getting banged up. Good quality and great price.  [END]
[BEGIN] nice camera but make sure to buy the micro SD card. no internal memory  [END]
[BEGIN] Very well build, be aware that it does not hold the Gopro with the Wasabi extended battery.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does the job. Comfortable yet slips from time to time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Gets the job done just fine. Anyone knows if i can use this adaptor with RZ67 lens? Or the RZ67 adaptor with RB67 lens?  [END]
[BEGIN] good price and product.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice collection of accessories but low quality of course!  [END]
[BEGIN] An excellent pouch to hold filters. Instead of 4 plastic filter holders you can condense them into one convenient holder.  [END]
[BEGIN] They re fine with me, no worries.  [END]
[BEGIN] Met my standards. Fast shipping  [END]
[BEGIN] I have not used this product under water yet. I did take a couple of pictures with it and they were great. I purchased this camera for a trip to the Bahamas in January. I hope it takes great pictures and I hope it doesn t leak!  [END]
[BEGIN] Easy and fun to use  [END]
[BEGIN] works very well  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great, no problems  [END]
[BEGIN] Solid lens for the price, hunts a little and motor noise can be heard during video sequences but and all around keeper  [END]
[BEGIN] Performs as the original Nikon QR foot does. Quick to put and take off. I like the rubber coated tightening knobbed compared to Nikon s. Great value compared to Nikon OEM, 4X less cost! Only time will reveal whether it is as robust as the Nikon.  [END]
[BEGIN] very sturdy, easy to install. Little pricey on the import duties.  [END]
[BEGIN] For the price this is a good tripod. It may need to be oiled if you want to turn it easily for panning shots.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bought this to add two more cameras to security system. Works good  [END]
[BEGIN] It works  [END]
[BEGIN] The package was a gift, so it s not fair that I rate it. I can say that everything that was included in the offer arrived on time and was in brand new condition. The person receiving the gift was very excited and continues to enjoy using it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome inexpensive light ring, the only con is that you can t use full range of your wide angle or wide angle zoom lens because the ring will crop the borders of the image.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s a good camera when it works, but sometimes we have had to call for tech support. However, they have been very helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] decent arch support for my feet. I wear them all the time. Like the style and looks, have held up well so far.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Product  [END]
[BEGIN] I love this film sheets! They are the perfect size to keep on my wallet. I ordered the 20 film sheets and they arrived in 2 days!!!!! I was really surprised! Im definitely going to buy more!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Solid case for new Phantom. Backpack is deep enough to fit everything securely. Enough cutouts and pockets to fit all my gear.  [END]
[BEGIN] It does the job of a lens protector without sacrificing image quality at a great price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good Camera... Great Picture... Easy Operation From both PC and Android (Apple ????? not my way).. Note: camera ID is in Low Case... NOT Upper Case as shown in the instruction.  [END]
[BEGIN] It lasts for hours, which is great since the batteries that I had did not last much.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good as expected  [END]
[BEGIN] I haven t used my camcorder in years because the battery wouldn t hold a charge. At a discounted price I can now capture the first s of my toddler.  [END]
[BEGIN] Easy to install and the quality of the video is decent. Although the apps do crash frequently.  [END]
[BEGIN] Arrived on time and as shown, used only to do a few splash shots.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pic nice and clear and easy to use-straight out the box with two cords done. I just wish it didn t lean no way to adjust  [END]
[BEGIN] Item delivered on time, was as described  [END]
[BEGIN] Seem to work fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great case..like it a lot holds everything well..if you use the blade guards it is a very tight fit to get the arms in with the attachment at the end of the arms..over all it s a good back pack case..  [END]
[BEGIN] Great buy. Fits my sony video camera perfectly  [END]
[BEGIN] It s a little heavy and I have a difficult time using to take clear pictures of my moving kids. but overall it is a great telephoto. the rest of the package is just a bonus.  [END]
[BEGIN] great product  [END]
[BEGIN] Bought it to fit 2 - 21.5&#34; iMacs. They fit great! I tried to fit a third and it barely didn t fit. Great case though!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good capacity.  [END]
[BEGIN] Item was as described and the actual product was in new condition. But the actual package it was is had been opened. You could clearly see the original tapping had been teared on all sides. Luckily the product works fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just as described-very nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product, just v wish it had mini USB instead of micro USB. Other than that it s a winner.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good overall, just the battery life is poor.should use AA battery  [END]
[BEGIN] This product works as expected and is well built.  [END]
[BEGIN] works like a battery should work  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great, fits around my NX3000 (without the detachable flash). Should be enough to protect my camera while traveling around Europe.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Product  [END]
[BEGIN] First one I ordered was D.O.A. but the company has a good return policy. I got a full refund. Decided to give it another try. New camera pen works great!  [END]
[BEGIN] good product  [END]
[BEGIN] Bought as a gift for my father. It uses motion detectors to turn itself on, which is very creepy and disturbing at night. But the display is beautiful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Gift for dad. He loved it Very portable and good viewing. The tripod is a bit flimsy but I guess Ok for the price, hence 4 stars  [END]
[BEGIN] It was good but not what I want it but it s really good came a week early  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Camera case.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice wireless camera. Setup was easy and the smartphone app is pretty good  [END]
[BEGIN] Not Canon Brand, but it does the job nicely.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good camera for the money. The box is sturdy (industrial) and the design is simple. My only complaint is the shipping time... almost 3 weeks seems a little long.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is decent for the price however, it burns through batteries like crazy!  [END]
[BEGIN] I still dont get what it does, it does not fit in my GoPro Hero 4 Silver, but its a cool keychain and bottle opener  [END]
[BEGIN] Great bag. Can cary everything that I want with room to spare.  [END]
[BEGIN] A great camera. Feels like a real camera in the hands. The only reason why I didn t give it five stars is because of the problem endemic to all digitals, the lag time on the shutter.  [END]
[BEGIN] this is a gift, looks like it will work perfectly - it would be nice to have an instruction booklet  [END]
[BEGIN] Great. Hate the viewfinder.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well, doubles as an iphone and a GoPro stick.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well, and glad to have a protective filter on my Panasonic DMC-LX7. But, really, Panasonic should have just made the lens barrel filter ready, rather than compelling one to buy another item...  [END]
[BEGIN] It works well with practically any camera or tripod, and picks up sound quite nicely.  [END]
[BEGIN] Arrived quickly and works exactly as intended.  [END]
[BEGIN] used it couple of times and found ok  [END]
[BEGIN] I recieved the slide converter 1 day early the amazom box was in perfect condition. But package box was slightly damaged but did not affect operation of device. Just started using but don t know about relibility right now works as described.  [END]
[BEGIN] they work  [END]
[BEGIN] item was directly as describe  [END]
[BEGIN] Great camera! Great quality and tons of accesories. Works great so far!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Value  [END]
[BEGIN] Camcorder worked well although there was some pixiling after using Digital Video Head Cleaner everything worked out well, good buy, satisfied.  [END]
[BEGIN] works really well when it s working, my son loves it. It does what it describes, fly really well for a $50 drones. But one of the propeller fails after a few days of heavy use. It becomes useless if one of the propeller fails.  [END]
[BEGIN] Now I am always strapped for when things get messy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Compact case. Perfect for those who do not need to carry around a bunch of different lenses.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not bad for the price, it doesn t work really well with my d810 but is pretty handy for smaller cameras, (I cant reach all the neccasary buttons on the larger dslrs)  [END]
[BEGIN] Works fine but loose in socket  [END]
[BEGIN] Canon top quality & has the space I need. Only objection I have is the lack of a zippered top closure instead of the Velcro fastener option. It s noises & I don t feel as secure with my gear without a zipper closure. Maybe just me  [END]
[BEGIN] Too small for necklaces, and not enough lighting even in a brightly lit room. Otherwise great product.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hah Go Pro nervana  [END]
[BEGIN] Quality and price are great. I wish the threads weren t so darn long though. I m just posting this so the MNF might consider shortening them? :D  [END]
[BEGIN] Really easy to install. And love that I can get real time on my phone. Just download app and set up account good to go. Love it  [END]
[BEGIN] Looks like it will do the trick. Fairly comfortable and constructed well.  [END]
[BEGIN] well made. good price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works as well as original, but a tiny bit thicker making it difficult to eject from camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great protection.  [END]
[BEGIN] Better than the GoPro battery  [END]
[BEGIN] Fun to use. Very versatile. Held Canon Rebel ESO T3i stable and level. Hooked to a tree limb. :)  [END]
[BEGIN] I probably would have paid another $10 for GoPro s frame mount with the quick release. However this works too except the CamKix frame mount got caught in the front faceplate and bent the corner of it! Good thing these are replaceable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great!:)  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a very affordable remote. I would recommend taking out the battery when not in use. I have found the battery dead several times. After being stored for a short time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Exactly what I expected for the money. I wish the bars could be a little shorter, though. Too long with three bars, too short with two. Oh well, the price was right.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great, lightweight and nicely straps to wrist when your up a ladder!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good price on these batteries, and they arrived before I expected them to.  [END]
[BEGIN] seems to be doing a great job as of yet! smudging is a bit temperamental when it happens.. but I wipe it with a lens cloth and it seems to do the trick  [END]
[BEGIN] Loved these! Eventually the clamp tips did snap or break off so not sure if that s normal wear and tear or if I did something that caused it. Just used it to clamp fabric onto my photography backdrop stand.  [END]
[BEGIN] Haven t used it yet but it is charging  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice product, doesn t have the quality feel that more expensive ones have, but performs great nonetheless. Only problems I had was the battery door not staying shut occasionally, and the foot being plastic, I broke it while removing it from the camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] Muy buenos  [END]
[BEGIN] Easy to operate. Slides sometimes hang up inside. Otherwise - light is bright, picture is good. Did not try negatives.  [END]
[BEGIN] When used with various Lowepro bags and their utility belt, this is a great way to distribute weight and reduce the strain on my shoulders (already an issue with two Nikon DSLRs).  [END]
[BEGIN] This was for a Granddaughter, so I don t know about the performance. I did get it in just a couple of days, so I was very happy about that.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great 200 ISO color negative film. Seem to shoot a little blue for me, I have been editing this during scanning.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not much to say. I m happy with this product.  [END]
[BEGIN] good camara but didn t realise that it didn t have share options  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked as advertised. Expensive way to print out pics.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good price  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good, but it doesn t quite have the range of configuration I was hoping for. I could probably use on with slightly longer arms. Mechanically, it is solid.  [END]
[BEGIN] Got the wrong size case but it works good for something else I am using it for  [END]
[BEGIN] works just fine  [END]
[BEGIN] Product met all my expectations, price competitive and delivery quick. What else can one add?  [END]
[BEGIN] The product was delivered in a timely manner. It was purchased for a new Canon 70D DSLR. It fits well, but it is a bit loose. It falls off in my camera bag, as I m removing the camera. While using the camera there is no problem.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very clear, bright image with accurate color. Weight is not too great for easy carrying considering the magnification and objective lens diameter. Lens caps are awkward in use.  [END]
[BEGIN] product was as advertised. shipment was quick.  [END]
[BEGIN] Product was as advertised and a great buy for the price, shipping was on time and the tripod works with a number of different cameras. A worthwhile purchase  [END]
[BEGIN] My purpose for this camera was to watch my dog. I love it. I can also talk to him which is awesome. To be able to scan the room Is a great feature. Highly recommend this product.  [END]
[BEGIN] i like it. great !  [END]
[BEGIN] My son really liked the camera and it looks to have a good seal. Should come with some small memory stick.  [END]
[BEGIN] work good no problems yet  [END]
[BEGIN] Definitely a little too expensive for what it gives you but it does perform well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great value, good quality kit, seems solid.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rounded ones fit well on the top of my 8hp Johnson motor. I also used one on the dashboard of my jeep. Also worked perfect.  [END]
[BEGIN] The batteries doesn t hold the charge as well as the actual fujifilm battery I have. I noticed if I don t use the batteries after charging them, they slowly lose charge. So they are not amazing, but work as expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] The colors are not as vivid as I would like, but far superior to my last photo frame. I have not a explored all its capabilities, but it appears it will do more than I will ever use. It is a good value and well worth its price.  [END]
[BEGIN] For the money, this is a nice quality case. Bought it for a Phantom 3. The hell fits great. Had to do a few small cuts for the controller. But it was easy with an electric kitchen knife. Not as sturdy as a hard case, but good basic protection.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great WiFi camera for the price...easy to set up  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good quality and very light.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent monopod. It comes with a phone holder and it is also good for camera. Most importantly, it locks, which allows to install a phone or a camera without any fears. It looks sturdy, I hope it will last. It comes with phone holder and a screw for Gopro.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty small, but does work.  [END]
[BEGIN] These work pretty well and last a reasonable length of time (without using the flash, though I ve read LION AA batteries last longer.) Having 2 batteries means you always have a spare ready to go if 1 batteries gives out. And it was a good deal.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product  [END]
[BEGIN] This item arrived in good condition. It will come in handy when I need to clean my camera and looks like a quality item. I received this item at a discount for my honest opinion.  [END]
[BEGIN] Takes a bit of patience to dial in motion sensitivity so that it doesn t record anything that moves. Make sure to schedule reboot at least once per week. Dlink app is ok. Saving recordings to network drive performs better than to sandisk.  [END]
[BEGIN] We have a great picture. Very pleased.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Update  [END]
[BEGIN] Good for quick carry, doesn t take all your lenses and accessories.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good  [END]
[BEGIN] Works perfectly  [END]
[BEGIN] The filter holder is padded and, protects the unused filters. I consider this to be a very nice value for the money.  [END]
[BEGIN] An inexpensive way to adjust the flash on the a6000. Works well.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is a good semi professional camera. The only problem is sometimes gets hard to get focus.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great picture quality without that &#34;fish-eye&#34; look, night vision works well ( unless pay higher $ for infrared cams ) No problem with cables and power adaptor.  [END]
[BEGIN] I really enjoyed it. It works as expected. However, it kind of sucks that it only takes 8 pictures, especially with it being so expensive.  [END]
[BEGIN] So far so good.  [END]
[BEGIN] as described.  [END]
[BEGIN] Order it and got it pretty quick. The item is working just fine. Came about half charge on one and the other was full charged. Thanks  [END]
[BEGIN] Roy martin help was so appreciated thank you foscam!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good quality tape.  [END]
[BEGIN] Exactly what we expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] They work great, good investment!  [END]
[BEGIN] The pictures are clear and pretty low maintenance for the price. The night view could be better, and the mounting brackets are cheap, they never stay in place and requires frequent adjustments. Anyway, over all a good buy for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hidden camera, no one even can notice it s recording. Directions are confusing, but after you buy it, the seller sends clear instructions. Wish it was 1080p too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Used for transporting firearm on vacation  [END]
[BEGIN] Have been using this camera both on dry land and underwater. I think the auto-focus is not quite as good as the old Canon that I replaced but, otherwise, this is a nice camera for someone who just wants to &#34;point and shoot.&#34;  [END]
[BEGIN] Good idea for waterproof cameras, but no way to adjust for wrist/hand size. Well made  [END]
[BEGIN] Does what it says  [END]
[BEGIN] I would have given it 5 stars but you cannot view your photos with this on, otherwise it works as advertied  [END]
[BEGIN] It s a good camera for what I need it for. The tripod is stupid... seriously, there s no other description for it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Have not had to use alarm, but like knowing that it is here if I do need it. I tested alarm, and it worked.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very easy to setup. The cameras have decent low light resolution but in color and with light sometimes are blurry. The motion detection is very sensitive, picking up even slight movements. Overall and for them money, this is a very good product.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s awesome lots of pockets, and useful cutouts. It doesn t hold a P3 controller perfect, but I made do.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good camera for the price!  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good product  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Value!  [END]
[BEGIN] once adjusted to both eyes it works great, Good buy for the money  [END]
[BEGIN] Easy to use. Gives good light. A tiny bit too heavy for my flash--causing it to move the swivel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well, had for a while and still working well. Nights a little blurry but still good. I will try to put a photo or two on here of the night vision. In the next couple days.:-)  [END]
[BEGIN] The fit is acceptable, but a little loose. It comes off just a little too easily.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the Camera. Bit confused on some of the accessories that came with it.. some seem to be missing parts....  [END]
[BEGIN] I wish it had a wider panoramic view, other than that it is awesome!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good quality but do not fit as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good addition to the Roam 3 bundle, exactly what it is....nothing more....nothing less...  [END]
[BEGIN] Like the others, very nice, I have seen some ?? hoodlums walk be and sort of glanced around to find the other cameras, some fake many many real ones J R  [END]
[BEGIN] Solid image quality. Interface not as good as GoPro, but otherwise can t find a flaw. Gopro accessories work well with it. Get a lot of interference when recording with auxiliary power source.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked for me......Takes a bit a skill to get a fine adjustment......course adjustment is quick and once locked with the thumb set screw very stable. So far only used with a 28 MM lens which is fairly light.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fair enough  [END]
[BEGIN] Does the job without extra wiring.  [END]
[BEGIN] I wouldn t recommended this for photography.. I use it for electronic pass thought for my canon s lens so I can control the aperture. The auto focus is to slow for any type of photography use  [END]
[BEGIN] for the money, not a bad buy.  [END]
[BEGIN] I just got this so we have sometime to try it out, but I plan on coming back with and updated 30day review! For the price this is amazing! It came with so many extras and I m really excited to take it with us to the pool tomorrow  [END]
[BEGIN] After testing all the accesories in different scenarios I can say that this bundle is very good, specially for the price. Only negative point is the weekness of selfie stick  [END]
[BEGIN] Stands seem a bit top heavy!  [END]
[BEGIN] Working Great  [END]
[BEGIN] Must use on flat surface  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great  [END]
[BEGIN] hi l hace neewer nw565ex is there any setting to remove the beep every time i take a photo  [END]
[BEGIN] I like it  [END]
[BEGIN] It shipped quickly, the product works perfectly for land or water. I am very satisfied with this model.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just what i needed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Glad to have another battery  [END]
[BEGIN] Great camera! Great video quality! This being said: The default IP differs from the documentation; the bundled software also kinda sucks... I recommend the Blue Iris software instead.  [END]
[BEGIN] nice and compact but sturdy  [END]
[BEGIN] was looking for an underwater stick to use for scuba/snorkeling.. this worked awesome  [END]
[BEGIN] Haven t put a 5 star yet because I m not 100% finished hooking up everything at the dvr, but so far everything is great!! Quality material and everything works. Can t beat the price either  [END]
[BEGIN] great value except battery charger charges the batteries slow  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product and deal. I bought this for my son, who likes to make movies and he absolutely loves it. The stand is just a tabletop model, I thought it would be bigger, but it folds down, so my son leaves it on all the time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Battery type and no recharge when connected to computer. All other features are good.  [END]
[BEGIN] A compact camera bag with comforted anti-theft features, nicely done!  [END]
[BEGIN] It works and charges 2 at once, but it feels cheap and the electronic display of the charge is wrong.  [END]
[BEGIN] good  [END]
[BEGIN] i m glad i purchased the hand trap, however, i haven t used it yet but the cost was great. i ve seen lots of professional photographers using their hand strap so i m sure when i use mind I will be glad i purchased it.  [END]
[BEGIN] best  [END]
[BEGIN] Simple but it s nicely made and it works  [END]
[BEGIN] so far so good bought less expensive model a year ago and screen looked schattered with colors and was disappointed after my first one lasted so long without problems  [END]
[BEGIN] Works good. Camera quality is not the best but does a job. Easy to install.  [END]
[BEGIN] very good  [END]
[BEGIN] Great bang for your buck  [END]
[BEGIN] So far works and my VHS camera hasn t fallen off.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good mounts and good price  [END]
[BEGIN] Good one I am using it for pat 2 years.  [END]
[BEGIN] One side of my Big lights don t work. Other than that the product is a great buy.  [END]
[BEGIN] I d give it 5 stars if it were metal, otherwise it is very real. Photo sensor shuts it off during daylight to save batteries. The IR LEDs for night vision are just like the real thing. Very real looking if you are 10+ft away.  [END]
[BEGIN] The zoom feature is nice, however the picture quality is not much better than my 800 TV lines of resolution from my Zosi camera at one third the price. Rain tends to stick to the lens and distort the image.  [END]
[BEGIN] very good tripod for photo and video. i recomand  [END]
[BEGIN] So far, a good solid camera that takes good pictures. My daughter took it to Europe, and the pictures turned out pretty good.  [END]
[BEGIN] This works alright. With snappier rounds, it can get a little loose. I haven t had a problem with my .22 or 9mm. We put it on my friends .40 and it tended to fly around a little.  [END]
[BEGIN] Solid buy for a much cheaper price than the canon version. I haven t used the canon version, so I can t necessarily compare the difference of the two.  [END]
[BEGIN] The lights are great and illuminate my studio set for video and photo as expected. I would ve rated it a 5 star if it came with a carry bag.  [END]
[BEGIN] well worth price for on the go Videos.. I use if for my Golf outings... nice !!  [END]
[BEGIN] A OK!!  [END]
[BEGIN] [[ASIN:B00LAVA2OW EEEKit 8-in-1 Accessories Kit for Gopro HERO 4 Session LCD Black/Silver HD 3+/3/2/1 Camera]] It all came as advertised, and I am impressed with the assortment of accesories. I have not fitted the camera to these accessories yet, but it looks like it should all work. I m happy.  [END]
[BEGIN] you get what you paid for. items are not super premium but ok as they re not expensive, the straps for head and chest are totally worth it.  [END]
[BEGIN] They do the job but if I would had known exactly what I was looking for I would have went with a better brand  [END]
[BEGIN] This product is fine. It didn t get five stars due to the fact the band that holds the filters in place doesn t work to well.  [END]
[BEGIN] really good film. although taking pictures outside normally makes the picture over exposed. the film lasts for a long time and is just great over all.  [END]
[BEGIN] Digital Goja was great, everything came as advertised. All the items were working properly. My only concern is that the Sigma Lens itself takes soft pictures, in general. I think it still is a good walk-around lens but I wish it could take sharper images.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have both this camera and a Go Pro brand. I found this one to be much easier to use, lighter weight without feeling cheap and much less expensive!  [END]
[BEGIN] good price/value  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera works fine  [END]
[BEGIN] I like the filter set but the filter holder could be a little stronger :):) otherwise the filters work well  [END]
[BEGIN] It met my expectations. For the price, it s worth it. The resolution is somewhat limited.  [END]
[BEGIN] I absolutely love these for the price! I bought one a year ago and just bought the 2nd.  [END]
[BEGIN] It works great with my Sony Nex 6.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great so far!,  [END]
[BEGIN] I might like it more if the product would have instructions on how to use it.. having great difficulty collimating my celestron reflecting telescope.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the color and touch screen and ease of use.... But it SUCKS UP YOUR BATTERY FAST.  [END]
[BEGIN] very useful but no adjustment of light  [END]
[BEGIN] Small but perfect for this camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good!!  [END]
[BEGIN] as back up batteries PERFECT Work with camera charge time a little short  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent a must have for a Sony camera  [END]
[BEGIN] My son loves it and uses it in our pool a lot.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good lens for shooting moon.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice camera  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything works and does the job. Light weight and easy to carry, like to a waterfall. Not made for rough handeling and I would not recommend use by children as the legs could be bent.  [END]
[BEGIN] Didn t use right away. By the time we started using it, found out that there was a glitch in the remote and had to spend an additional $50 for download cable and update, just so we could use the remote control  [END]
[BEGIN] A little bit tight for my WB350F but still a decent case.  [END]
[BEGIN] Know that this product comes from China and may take time to arrive. Product works nice in that it covers both the eye piece as well as the LCD screen. Only downside is that it easily rocks back and forth (left and right) fairly easily.  [END]
[BEGIN] It took weeks to get here from China. Phantom 3 fits in there great. You have to remove the tablet holder from the remote and no place for tablet inside. Not super rugged, but is much better than a floppy, soft-sided bag. Couldn t beat the price!  [END]
[BEGIN] lot of camera for the dollar  [END]
[BEGIN] GREAT EQUIPMENT at a GREAT PRICE!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I m hoping these batteries will last longer than the last ones I purchased.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great warning system that is inexpensive yet gets the job done.  [END]
[BEGIN] Recommended by fro knows photo, yeah its OK, pretty simple, limited use since there is no zoom.  [END]
[BEGIN] Solid product and a good cost benefit. Great for everyday shooting. Good materials and well made.  [END]
[BEGIN] works just like the originals  [END]
[BEGIN] They fit well, good replacement!  [END]
[BEGIN] Well designed, very functional. Light weight.  [END]
[BEGIN] Used our floats at the beach and they worked very well. Love the bright colors for easy detection in the water. Only concern is the thin cord which could break easily. Only time will tell for that. Excellent customer service!  [END]
[BEGIN] A gift--got rave reviews.  [END]
[BEGIN] This worked great for about three months then the legs started loosening up.  [END]
[BEGIN] Named after horseradish LMAO!! Works okay and price is good. Just for backup. I use the Nikon battery as long as it has juice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Optically excellent. I m coming from the crappy 28-100mm f/3.5-5.6 kit lens from 2002. If your sample has the squeak it s really annoying. Oh, well. That s what I get for going the cheapest used I could find.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s handy and compact, but sometimes the camera makes it too top-heavy if you re using it as a tripod...the little legs are not enough of a base. Works well for hand extension though!  [END]
[BEGIN] liner not glued very well! selfie stick spins around!! HEAD GEAR GREAT!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Gets the job done.clear picture works great.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is the new hobby to keep me relatively  [END]
[BEGIN] Good, versatile bag. Nice solution for dividing compartments and to take out the entire cushion assembly. Very good weatherproofing. I am missing smaller organizing pockets, say, in the flap. Carrying options: shoulder strap, hand carrying strap, attach to suitcase.  [END]
[BEGIN] Glad to see I m not the only one who couldn t fold the thing back up!! Will be making a trip to YouTube for a video! Great size though! Large enough for someone to get in and move around comfortably.  [END]
[BEGIN] Easy to use and the included case is a plus  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product!  [END]
[BEGIN] Looks good and fits well. A good idea for protecting the lens but have no way of evaluating the optical benefits.  [END]
[BEGIN] a great handycam  [END]
[BEGIN] Recommended. :)  [END]
[BEGIN] I like it, good for the price  [END]
[BEGIN] A great package! Everything is new, all counted for. The price is awesome for how much accessories you get with the camera. I think this bundle is the lowest priced on Amazon... or any market. On time shipping!  [END]
[BEGIN] It works well but have to be right on your idem to bee looked @  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera works great! Only downside is that the box didn t include a manual or memory card.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great light. Just wish it was AA or AAA instead  [END]
[BEGIN] Book I received with it was not in English  [END]
[BEGIN] Light weight, very adjustable, great fees tires.  [END]
[BEGIN] solid case/great for price  [END]
[BEGIN] The case is really nice. It s sturdy, well made and comfortable when wearing it. My only complaint is there is no place to put prop guards. I have to carry my prop guards outside of the case.  [END]
[BEGIN] These are good, they do what they re intended, which is to power an IP security camera, and are not expensive.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice and small and works well  [END]
[BEGIN] When I used this, it completely drained a newly charged camera battery in 3 hours. Thankfully I own a backup battery. Otherwise it s awesome!  [END]
[BEGIN] Amazing gopro piece !  [END]
[BEGIN] works well  [END]
[BEGIN] The size it s very practical, too small.  [END]
[BEGIN] A bit snug for my camera, but it is very nice and it was a great price!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very fast service. Great to work with. Camera is very nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything okey  [END]
[BEGIN] Fiddly to set up but it does work.  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect for the price every thing works but I have one complain, the screw that holds the position of the suction cup is no holding it, but the other things are perfect!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Difficult to set up but once it is set up correctly, it works like a charm. If your kit weighs more than about 3-4 lbs, this is not the stabilizer for you.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this. Is not auto-focus on Ds3100, but I prefer to use manual.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have this camera. It worked for a few months and I got a few worthwhile images from it. It likes bright sun and works well in the water. The good thing about this camera is the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] SONY engineering always seem to make weird design decisions. This time, they removed the IR receiver which has been available in all previous models. So I can flip the LCD screen 180 degree but there is no easy way to trigger the shutter. Brilliant!!  [END]
[BEGIN] looks good  [END]
[BEGIN] I love this camera. Takes good pics and is very user friendly, not a ton of confusing buttons. It s kind of bulky and it s hard to find a case that fits it, but I would say that s the only con.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fits the tripod well. Looks k=like it will do the job needed  [END]
[BEGIN] Film worked as intended, wish it was less cost effective, remember to not shake the photos and to place in the box the film came in to help develop them faster.  [END]
[BEGIN] I really enjoyed the product and the pouch is incredibly handy for stowing safely, however the Polarized lens does not screw in tight. It stays put, but will come off if pressure is applied in the outward direction.  [END]
[BEGIN] as expected  [END]
[BEGIN] Easy to use. Sleek. I like the options for uploading pictures. My husband enjoyed his birthday gift. :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Exactly as expected delivery was a bit slow.  [END]
[BEGIN] ok  [END]
[BEGIN] The color was a little off between materials, but the thing is very usefully and I am happy I bought it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good quality. Sturdy.. only problem is blue tooth not compatible with my phone :( other than that, good product.  [END]
[BEGIN] No issues with this replacement battery for my Canon elph. Haven t stressed it to much, though; just casual usage.  [END]
[BEGIN] help some  [END]
[BEGIN] All the harnesses work great but the hand bar is unstable and always fell over, I had to tape it right side up. Everything else works great!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great set for the price. Didn t come with any explanation as to what lense is used for what purpose. Overall pleased.  [END]
[BEGIN] Case Logic DCB-304  [END]
[BEGIN] Cut my finger on a shard of steel that was leftover from the machining process on one of the balljoints. But the arm works well, locks into place, and is stable.  [END]
[BEGIN] easy set up - high def only thing is that not enough controlled access when used as a nanny web cam compared to another webcam that i ditched [Belkin], this one never lost connection to the network  [END]
[BEGIN] Seem fine and strong, but only time and many uses will really prove these as good product. They are fatter than most of my other Nimh AAs, so they don t fit well in some applications.  [END]
[BEGIN] This fit well on my D5300, not a perfect fit but good enough, I think that I should ve taken more care putting it on.  [END]
[BEGIN] Exactly what we needed!  [END]
[BEGIN] Product is good the battery I ordered was not, the one I had here did fit fine. I had an off brand that did not fit, fits in camera though!  [END]
[BEGIN] I like this case it works perfect and half the price  [END]
[BEGIN] heck ya  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice and useful set. Quality matches price. Shipping was fast and packaging was fine. Minor scratches on watch stand, but the watch band covers this when it s used.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent binoculars for the price. Great size.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pare soleil efficace  [END]
[BEGIN] Great addition to the Orion 4.5 StarBlast, nice wide field of view.  [END]
[BEGIN] No comments  [END]
[BEGIN] Case is a little bulky for putting into a camera case so i can t actually carry it with me but it all works well  [END]
[BEGIN] Good props  [END]
[BEGIN] It works, but it s...big. It bulges over the side a bit more than it seems like it should, creating a lip on the end of my lens. This metal lip makes getting to the lens cap more difficult than it needs to be.  [END]
[BEGIN] good value  [END]
[BEGIN] Can t speak to the quality of the power output but in the field they last roughly as long as my Canon batteries.  [END]
[BEGIN] very good purchase. my camera would not work with the old battery that came with the camera. I tried charging it several times but nothing worked. so glad that amazon had these in stock.  [END]
[BEGIN] It works! Easy to setup.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheap, comes with everything you would ever need! Not as strong as GoPro (after 4 weeks a mount broke) The selfie stick (mono pod) tend to rotate a bit, but not to the point where it s unusable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good for a reasonable price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Gave this camera to my 12 year old granddaughter and she has loved it! Is putting together picture albums and going thru film like crazy. This is what she picked out for her birthday and she has enjoyed it ever since. Great little product here.  [END]
[BEGIN] these are great though we only received three instead of the four indicated.  [END]
[BEGIN] fit perfectly. Included a bonus - ability to tie the lens cap to the neck strap (won t lose it again).  [END]
[BEGIN] Screws right into my X-Pro 1 without any hassle and stays there pretty tightly. Looks good with the black and it s pretty lightweight. Plus it s the only soft button I ve had so far that hasn t fallen off!  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome!  [END]
[BEGIN] This tripod is perfect for the price! Easy to use, great size and worth it. Product came in perfect, all parts work!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice kit wish there was a small thin piece of metal to protect the set screw from bezel damage but I Mac Gyvered a shim to do the job works great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product... Used it and works magnificently. Reduced the amount of gear I sometimes travel with. Loving it.  [END]
[BEGIN] It has better resolution than the previous generation, but did not include any software for viewing multiple cameras, as in the past.  [END]
[BEGIN] Took a while to ship but it s exactly as described.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does what it says  [END]
[BEGIN] Love it. Bought this as a gift for a friend and you can clearly see the difference in the pictures. Would recommend this and the price is right.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is a very nice bracket. This is the only item that I have ordered from Foscam that I haven t had to send back for replacement.  [END]
[BEGIN] very good camera, but very temperamental. One should double check shots before relying on the evf focus or otherwise.  [END]
[BEGIN] So far, so good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Easy to use, great price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect fit for my Sony camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great price to give as a gift to a young graduate.  [END]
[BEGIN] Seemed to work well for calibration, but started bugging me to recalibrate about two weeks later and I can t get it to stop.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sorta big but it works  [END]
[BEGIN] Don t try to tighten these suckers even slightly with your fingers! I did. And there was no way I could untighten them by hand! The lens binds! I actually had to take a pair of waterpump pliers to the filter to get it off. Just saying!  [END]
[BEGIN] It is okay little too heavy but not try to look at the moon yet Wait until next trip to Asia.  [END]
[BEGIN] Seems to work pretty well, a bit faster than in camera charging. It does get a bit warm, but that hasn t been a problem so far. The batteries seem to hold a charge about the same as the Sony branded options, time will tell if they last as long.  [END]
[BEGIN] It has a pretty decent quality, great camera to take on a short trip, hiking or biking. No complaints. My only complaint is that it does not come with a memory card. The price is right and the quality is better than I expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just what I needed and a price that I was very happy with  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great. Just wish it had an off switch.  [END]
[BEGIN] very nice  [END]
[BEGIN] Didn t like the way the vivitar lens hood fit so I got a genuine cannon lens hood  [END]
[BEGIN] I am very happy with it s calibration results, but the software is OK. Calibration takes a while, and the software could be a bit more powerful. I bought this hoping that I could accurately change color temperature throughout the day, but it s not an easy process.  [END]
[BEGIN] Arrived on time. Exactly as expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s fun. Make sure lighting is good when you take pic. If they are pics will be nice. Took it to a wedding. Fun. I give it 4.5 stars  [END]
[BEGIN] very niice  [END]
[BEGIN] very useful item! everything was ok, recommended!  [END]
[BEGIN] The item works as advertised. The only downside I have found so far is it does not fit as well as the original lens cap did. It does, however, fit well enough to keep dirt, water, etc off of the lens.  [END]
[BEGIN] ALL WENT WELL  [END]
[BEGIN] I ve been able to calibrate all of my lenses with ease.  [END]
[BEGIN] The only reason I m not giving this a 5 star rating is the cheaply-constructed plastic ring adapter that comes with it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome  [END]
[BEGIN] I needed to file down the base that slips into the camera s hot shoe so it fit better (the paint made it just a bit too big to easily fit), otherwise it works great! I highly recommend this adaptor for devices like Sony s HDR-AZ1.  [END]
[BEGIN] This works if it is trying to hold up just the camera. If you have any other accessories on it though, it doesn t seem to work so well. The bright orange does help find it in the water though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works, but be sure to rinse thoroughly after saltwater use as it uses cheap screws which will rust in no time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Product works fine (my second set). Inexpensive &#34;fix&#34; If you are going to get serious about using your GoPro, the higher end filter solutions will be better for you, but these do work as described, though short lived if handled often.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] They fit and do the job, although they seem to have less capacity than the Fuji batteries. On the plus side, the included charger is much more compact than the one that came with the camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love it. it works wonderfully with my Canon 5D MK3. Heavy duty construction. 4 stars because I think it s overpriced. Should be a $29.99 item.  [END]
[BEGIN] Still have not used, but looks good  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great easy set except I can t get internet connection to the Internet no usb connect screen reads.  [END]
[BEGIN] The lens protector is a must with this frame when not in use. The frame bends easily to get the camera in and out.  [END]
[BEGIN] No performance issues.....this link process my photos directly to my computer without any issues.  [END]
[BEGIN] It came with a ton of stuff. Something you deffenitly have to mess around with and get used to. Ober all very good product and it shipped fast.  [END]
[BEGIN] This serves the intended purpose- blocking excess light so that I can better see the viewfinder display. It does, however, block some of the rear screen. Debating about trimming it a bit.  [END]
[BEGIN] takes good pictures  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice, but loosens up in the water and came off during scuba dive.  [END]
[BEGIN] A little pricey but does what it is supposed to.  [END]
[BEGIN] So far so good. Everything was there and more than I will probably ever need  [END]
[BEGIN] Performed as expected. Still have not used all the accessories. Update. The headstrap works great better than the GoPro model for me.Have not used all the accessories, only those related to diving at present.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love it. Bought two. May get a third. Can check on my elderly dog during the day.  [END]
[BEGIN] Got the Sidekick Black Duo. Powerful light that attaches to the gopro via a long screw that holds at the pivot point. Great accessory. It s a bit too bright for close up but it does light up subject nicely overall. Great product.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very useful  [END]
[BEGIN] its a X mass gift so have not used but looks like its a nice item ......  [END]
[BEGIN] Works ok.  [END]
[BEGIN] I am very happy with this lens. Did not have any kind of problem. Nice Bokeh in my pictures. I have been using with TC 1.4  [END]
[BEGIN] Lots of pictures of my hand due to lens placement. Underwater worked and underwater color was good.  [END]
[BEGIN] It didn t fit my light setup but with a little modifying it worked out. Fun product.  [END]
[BEGIN] Well pachaged and arrived very quickly. They charged up well and seem to be working just fine  [END]
[BEGIN] I bought this for my Tamron AF18-270mm f/3.5-6.3 lens. Primary purpose is to use it as a protection to the front element of the lens. Very pleased with the quick shipment.  [END]
[BEGIN] great tool for knowing who s comming in your house.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good system, easy to set up, works good, does good in the dark  [END]
[BEGIN] Took a long time to get them but they are exactly what I wanted!  [END]
[BEGIN] It s amazing...as far as a 1000 m range when used as a momentary switch, the relay can chatter at 3 m if you stand between the devices.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not much to talk about, it is ridiculously easy to install and sounds pretty good.  [END]
[BEGIN] A battery is a battery, what more can be said. The ordering process was simple and it arrived on time. And I did order a second one.  [END]
[BEGIN] Maybe it s great product, but it s not that easy to use.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good!  [END]
[BEGIN] Exactly what I expected  [END]
[BEGIN] Quick and as described  [END]
[BEGIN] Inexpensive way to get macro effects. Works best on 3rd objects (e.g. bugs, flowers, etc.) Not good for magnifying flat surfaces due to edge effects.  [END]
[BEGIN] useful good condition  [END]
[BEGIN] This lens works great, it is very light zoom is smooth. I recommend this lens  [END]
[BEGIN] It s OK.  [END]
[BEGIN] Now I just don t have to worry about not having a battery when I need it the most.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great but would have liked some way to attach wrist/hand strap. It s still an excellent value.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is such a great product! The camera is very easy to use and it has great pictures from it. When I was a child I always wanted a Polaroid camera and now I do. This is so much better than any other Polaroid camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good product  [END]
[BEGIN] It works just the way it supposed to be.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good picture, too bad the lens scratch easily. Make sure you shake your camera underwater to get all the bubbles out before recording. Or another tip is to remove and reattach the filter while under water  [END]
[BEGIN] The camera is wonderful,I really got what I wanted at a very great price  [END]
[BEGIN] Good  [END]
[BEGIN] Good product, Works as described haven t used it yet in the field cause ive been fighting my GoPro to update correctly but is sturdy built well and holds the GoPro very well. would recommend for somebody looking to either film live feed or charge for longer time lapse/video  [END]
[BEGIN] Looks like the TV is on from outside. Somebody must be home, right?  [END]
[BEGIN] Like having as a practical spare  [END]
[BEGIN] I thought it will be other type of camera with more features but still good for my photography classes.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good Material only first time to open is a little bit hard.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does the job. Not as nice as the Nikon one. But at 1/3 the price and a couple free goodies in the box.  [END]
[BEGIN] Arrived quickly and in great condition.It works ok but doesn t seem to last quite as the original. Just a little weaker I think.  [END]
[BEGIN] works great. Also nice useful kit included.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very attractive and sturdy posing stool. Assembly was very simple but because of the skimpy packaging, the seat-cushion was left with a large indentation mark that has not gone away after about 4 weeks. The height adjusting mechanism works well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Function OK. Quality OK. Delivery takes time from China.  [END]
[BEGIN] Was just what I was looking for to Go Pro paddleboarding  [END]
[BEGIN] Using one on each of my Jeeps. One of which is used on a fender lip mount.  [END]
[BEGIN] Well made but a tight fit for a camera with a zoom lens attached  [END]
[BEGIN] Film worked as intended, wish it was less cost effective, remember to not shake the photos and to place in the box the film came in to help develop them faster.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Camera!!  [END]
[BEGIN] My daughter was pleased  [END]
[BEGIN] stylish and well made. Blue tooth works wonderfully and is easy to use. Camera is high quality; however, it seems to aim low. Like it is made for people with low setting ears. I only capture about the bottom 2/3 of whatever I am looking at when using the camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have flew it just about 5 times. I carefully read some of the comments here and yes you should make sure you rad and review any information prior to flying this copter. I could see how it could flay away if you don t read the instructions.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works as expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] They work great put off good light. Carrying bag is cheap and zipper is too but I didn t buy it for the case. Switch was broken on one of the chords but no biggie to just fix myself with a new switch.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent  [END]
[BEGIN] asdescribed/ fast ship/ fair price/ recommend seller.  [END]
[BEGIN] The system did exactly what I needed. Soon after using the charger to charge my existing batteries and the new battery, the old charger that I was unable to locate in 3 weeks of tearing the house apart was found in plain sight.  [END]
[BEGIN] This camera has helped me collect so many precious memories...  [END]
[BEGIN] Great kit at a great value. I only gave it 4 stars because the selfie stick is useless. It can t handle the weight of the gopro and won t hold it upright. It just spins around and faces down. Other than that piece, the rest seems to be great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Still learning how to use. Older eyes and small screens....  [END]
[BEGIN] for the price, it s worth it. most of the cradles are very tight fitting but they all make it eventually. the case is bulky and there is really no good way to get it all in the case. But, again, for the price you can t beat it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked perfectly. Car charger is an added bonus!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I like the mount. Should have ribbed the barrel so it won t drop down on the stem over rough roads.  [END]
[BEGIN] The tilt motion has some tension but the pan is really smooth  [END]
[BEGIN] Good: Solid Cheese construction Solid when Screwed down. Bad: No real bad things to say yet. Gets a bit in the way of using the view finder, flipped around or not because of the little butt end that sticks out.  [END]
[BEGIN] Would be super with a USB plug instead of a car port. Live in the now!  [END]
[BEGIN] good  [END]
[BEGIN] Works really good easy to set up as well.cameras are not the best and 2 of the 4 got wet when it rained other 2 still work good. Company did replace them free of charge. Other than that for price u realy can t go wrong.  [END]
[BEGIN] works well, is solid, but much heavier than I expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very pleased / works great / had a defective camera called GW and a RM Number was given to return camera / will update progress  [END]
[BEGIN] It is what it s advertized to be and works wel  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice soft rubber, fits snug  [END]
[BEGIN] It operates very well. I am still getting used to at the same time as with Windows 10. It replaces a lost Easy Share that had a rechargeable battery and a docking station.  [END]
[BEGIN] Solid. A bit heavy but on a bad thing for my rig. The holes are not universal for a AB Gold Mount which is why I got two of these but I made it work and it held. Cheaper compared to other 15mm cheese plates so I can t complain.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works good but you must have it about 3 feet off the ground and the chime is very loud a volume control would be nice  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a decent budget scanner. it won t blow your socks off but as long as you don t mind a little bit off work in Photoshop it s not bad.  [END]
[BEGIN] does the job, but should be made out of metal for strength  [END]
[BEGIN] does what it s supposed to. good stuff.  [END]
[BEGIN] WISH IT WORKED LONGER DISTANCE  [END]
[BEGIN] This was a part of a Christmas gift for my daughter and she likes it tho the photos are rather small.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works perfect  [END]
[BEGIN] it does what it says.  [END]
[BEGIN] They seem to work just fine. I have quite a few; probably more than I need.  [END]
[BEGIN] I use this lens probably the most - it gets me just the right amount of zoom, and the pictures come out super sharp and clear. Its not clunky or heavy to carry either.  [END]
[BEGIN] thanks  [END]
[BEGIN] Im happy with the quality and texture of this strap. Im using it on a fujifilm x100t and its secure and at an ideal length. There are slight abbrasion marks on the strap from the camera rubbing against the strap, but Ive conditioned this strap and it restored the texture.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well  [END]
[BEGIN] Picture quality is not great but it keeps my daughter happy.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is a good scope for the money with lots of attachments you can get for it. However like most of these lower priced ones, the tripods are pretty much useless as far as being sturdy enough.  [END]
[BEGIN] I should have waited to purchase one that was a little sturdier and taller. But for the price it is alright.  [END]
[BEGIN] nice  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice low cost alternative to a GoPro  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent Portable tripod. I always toss one into both cars. A little light for my full size Nikon but A1 for my Canon G15  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well with my camera  [END]
[BEGIN] Hope I don t have to use this but I do think its a great deal.  [END]
[BEGIN] Much cheaper than the Nikon flashes, with almost the same bells and whistles. Performs great  [END]
[BEGIN] Overall my daughter loves it for changing at dance competitions; however, it is difficult to fold down until you have practiced several times.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had a 12mm and it didn t give me a full view, this 16mm is about right.  [END]
[BEGIN] Product appears to be good quality and functions as advertised. Happy with the transaction.  [END]
[BEGIN] It works  [END]
[BEGIN] Looks nice. Easy to put on camera. You need to adjust it to your needs.  [END]
[BEGIN] This camera was exactly what I was looking for. Would give it 5 stars if the app didn t freeze up so often. Was easy to install and set up.  [END]
[BEGIN] wish more quality clear camara  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything went fine  [END]
[BEGIN] this product was good quality and meant every one of my requirements  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice selection the product price was fantastic and the quality is very nice can wait to start posting videos  [END]
[BEGIN] ok quality, did the job  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well- worth the money  [END]
[BEGIN] It was easy to install take a little wild to reach me be it s work well  [END]
[BEGIN] very good just wish it had an on when dark and off when light setting. the 4 or 8 hour option at dusk doesn t cover the entire night  [END]
[BEGIN] I bought this devise to help me clean the inside of my sewing machine. It blows all the tiny threads and lint and is very helpful. The rubber feels strong when squeezed, so I feel confident that this product will last a long time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Smaller then appears,good quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does what it says  [END]
[BEGIN] I have not had a chance to use these yet, but I did test them out and they work fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] A true five star product if it came with instructions. I would have gladly paid double the price for the inclusion of an instruction booklet with code examples and wiring charts.  [END]
[BEGIN] The camera is fine but the on-board memory is pathetic, all but requiring the purchase of supplemental memory cards. Consider the memory card as a hidden cost when buying this camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well. It even comes with a car charger. Plus the two battery pack I bought with it means I won t be caught without battery power for my camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] does the job  [END]
[BEGIN] Great quality glass on this pair of binoculars.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s been good to transfer our slides to digital. Easy to use.  [END]
[BEGIN] depth of field with small f-stops resolved!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great price it does it s job.  [END]
[BEGIN] The camera was relatively easy to setup, and the picture quality is alright. The build in audio isn t the greatest, but it has ports to plug in your own speakers/ mic for the camera if you want better ones. I have not had any issues with the camera yet.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good price. Ok batteries not as longest lasting as GoPro brand. At least you get two of them though and a nice dual charger. Nice to have backups.  [END]
[BEGIN] gracias  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great. On a full charge its only rated at about 8-10 minutes, but I have gotten 12 minutes out of a battery.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good for group shots you want to be in  [END]
[BEGIN] This is awesome. If it came with a case or something I d give it 5 stars.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a surprisingly good camera! Not quite five-star outstanding, but I am very, very happy with it. My family owns two now :- )  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great and is a must have when using in the ocean so that you don t loose it. 4 stars because the price was a little high. You pay the extra money for the brand instead of for the material. I recommend buying from different distributor.  [END]
[BEGIN] Price was right. Only used a few so far and they seem OK, but I m not yet sure.  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera great, servive fair but has gotten better  [END]
[BEGIN] It seems to work as advertised  [END]
[BEGIN] very good system  [END]
[BEGIN] Thank you!  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the quality and look of the case! The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because although manufacturer claims it will fit a Canon Powershot SX60 camera, IT DOES NOT! If that is what you have, I would not recommend you ordering this product.  [END]
[BEGIN] Price is right. Easy setup initially. Trouble getting sound from two separate computers. Tech help said it was computers fault. Both computers? Works fine on I phone. Now I can t even get a picture on those computers. Hate to invest hours in tech support.  [END]
[BEGIN] It does the job  [END]
[BEGIN] Well built easy to open & close ,i play inside with my nikon 7100 with 18-200 no probleme very sturdy, next i try in the field,that would be the test,I have a larger & heavier $600.00 tripod this dolica would be easier to hike with.  [END]
[BEGIN] The filter is quality made at a reasonable price. I use filters primarily to protect the expensive lenses that they are attached to from dust and debris.  [END]
[BEGIN] It would ve been 5 I ve stars if it wasn t 5 days late but it s a good product  [END]
[BEGIN] I am happy with the product as well as shipment on time.  [END]
[BEGIN] cool.  [END]
[BEGIN] Easy to take a photo of me!  [END]
[BEGIN] This provides serious protection for your camera. The fit is nice, and there are openings in strategic places for connections. The only downside is that manipulating the cover can be a bit tedious. The snaps work well, holding everything together, and yet are reasonably easy to open and close.  [END]
[BEGIN] nice kit at the right price  [END]
[BEGIN] Already have some. These last longer than the battery that came with the camera, I get ~250 stills with these. I always carry a spare. The deal where you get two batteries plus a charger is a good one, already have that so I just got the battery this time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice little dash cam. Works very well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great little tripod for the price. However the first one I received was defective -- the camera wouldn t attach properly and it was missing a tightener screw.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the camera. The speaker and mic don t work as well as I d like, but i can overlook that. The subscription price seems a little high.  [END]
[BEGIN] So far-all is well. Takes me awhile to figure out all the buttons, seems to be perfect. Took it kayaking with me and didn t have to worry about getting it wet...  [END]
[BEGIN] only one battery of the 2 worked for me  [END]
[BEGIN] Takes good photos and has everything a casual camera user like me would need. The menu navigation is awkward and slow and I ve had difficulty getting it synced up over WiFi to my phones and desktop.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cute little photo album. It s not the best quality, but I bought it for my 9 year old and she doesn t notice things like that. If she wanted another one I would buy it again for her.  [END]
[BEGIN] it is really fun and easy to control however the battery life is bad it well give you 2 to 5 min max and it take about 2 hours to charge  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product.  [END]
[BEGIN] good to have!  [END]
[BEGIN] Ok  [END]
[BEGIN] on time...worked  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Met every expectation... Couldn t be happier with results  [END]
[BEGIN] I like it.  [END]
[BEGIN] No problems. Works as expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] Batteries have lasted in this unit over a moth now in pouring rain for a month here in FL as still going good. Would recommend  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product. Only con I have with this is the tightening of the ball joint can be tight as it will go and still move in some positions. (Depends on how steep an angle you are at). Otherwise, great for smaller cameras ie: Mobius cam.  [END]
[BEGIN] works great  [END]
[BEGIN] I have not taken any serious photos with this lense yet. It seems to be very good at the very least. I did my research on this and this lens is recommended over the 10-24 Nikon lense. http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/10-24mm.htm  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheap and weird. Holds to the camera and lens well enough, but latch is sloppy. One screw interferes with the lens and had to be removed, and another screw broke off completely. Good machining quality and price, but be prepared to rework it a little to fit your lens.  [END]
[BEGIN] does what it does, cheap plastic but it s cheap cost too, works well.  [END]
[BEGIN] It does work. It does not make your lens a macro lens but allows it to focus at a closer distance.  [END]
[BEGIN] My first flash kit for my first DSLR camera. Easy to operate and produces excellent flash photos.  [END]
[BEGIN] Case is nice and helps protect my daughters camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] It does the job. It s lightweight and feels flimsy, and doesn t have the best tactile feedback for the button... but for the price, what do you expect? Works fine with my Pentax K-50.  [END]
[BEGIN] Necessary if using GoPro in water!  [END]
[BEGIN] It works for what I needed. Fits in the bag I bought.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good camera. Lots of features. A little flimsy.  [END]
[BEGIN] WORKS GREAT!!  [END]
[BEGIN] ok  [END]
[BEGIN] My concern was the battery and after 2 months, it s still almost full even with the sensor on outside the gate. Setup was easy and fast. Connections are good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Thanks!  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a great camera. The product arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Unfortunately it broke after the first set of film. Trying to figure out how to fix it or if I should just buy another one.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great for the camera without battery grip holder and bigger lens but would not buy it if you like to leave those on your camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect size, but a little bulky. Small enough, but big enough to fit batteries, charger and a slot for one SD chip. Wish it had smaller handle option and can remove larger strap option.  [END]
[BEGIN] for budget consumers, this tripod from Ravelli will be the best choice because of its durability and reliability while on the job  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect condition works great. Not exactly like pictured. Newer model  [END]
[BEGIN] Good as expected  [END]
[BEGIN] Fits LCD screen perfectly as described  [END]
[BEGIN] My Grandchildren our having a great time flying the drone.  [END]
[BEGIN] Arrived on time also came with two minor cracks, based on the reviews i was worried of quality... But shows perfectly  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfectly functional cleaning cloths, though they seem to be of different types of cloth...  [END]
[BEGIN] It works quite well. I am having an issue getting securely attached to my tripod so it doesn t move on the tripod head.  [END]
[BEGIN] adequate  [END]
[BEGIN] Good deal.  [END]
[BEGIN] I m very disappointed with the GoPro4 Back. I purchased it and after 1 week, It started freezing and now I cannot use anymore!!! I lost information of my last two adventure running!!!! I really hate it!!!! It freezes every I press the Buttons Mode and Shuttle!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I use my camera every day for work and I ve tried a few different brands. None last as long as the original Canon battery, but these come closest.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have found that when taking pictures with it, it works best on 1 to 2 subjects and only close up. So if that is what you need it for then I would suggest it. It is tricky when you have glasses. It leaves the circle light on them.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fine  [END]
[BEGIN] very good piece of little majic in Photo & VideoTechnology  [END]
[BEGIN] Just ok ,four star  [END]
[BEGIN] A little thin but gorgeous and can t beat the price. Need thicker background underneath to avoid translucency. I just used an older backdrop and it worked perfectly.  [END]
[BEGIN] small but nice when you need some extra light.  [END]
[BEGIN] The strap was too big to hook up to my wife s camera, but I was able to adapt it. Works Great.  [END]
[BEGIN] They don t last as long as the OEM batteries, but with 2 of these in a battery grip, you ll make it through an entire day of shooting with power to spare. Considering the price, I d buy more of these before spending the $ for the OEM battery.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works okay for the money!  [END]
[BEGIN] The lens cap fits fine on my Nikon Coolpix P90 NIKOR 24X 4.4-110.4mm lens. It gets my 4 star solely because it fits OK, hasn t broken, and was cheap.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty much a good value. Fairly complete package, although I am sure that eventually I will be upgrading some of the accessories.  [END]
[BEGIN] nice product , but it should come with power supply or choice of when buying from this company  [END]
[BEGIN] Comparatively speaking, this is a great deal on the instax mini film. Best price I have found! Shipped in 2 days with prime. Thus will be my go to film purchase when I need refills for my Fujifilm Hello Kitty Instax Mini!  [END]
[BEGIN] A decent lens for beginners-awesome with lots of light  [END]
[BEGIN] Its hard fort me to give 5 but it works and is what I needed thanks for the good service  [END]
[BEGIN] Has all the bells and whistles you need. The only drawback is that the shutter is loud.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works good.  [END]
[BEGIN] WORKS WELL, Satified with the quality for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice case. Room for extra battery, card  [END]
[BEGIN] good inexpensive attachment for my Canon telephoto lens to provide protection.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well. And for that price no one can complain.  [END]
[BEGIN] easy to set up and use  [END]
[BEGIN] Just what was requested. Thank you.  [END]
[BEGIN] Charges good, keeps full charge for long time  [END]
[BEGIN] Gift, reasonable, child is happy.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of those you get what you pay for. It carries a good amount, durability is the issue. Mine s already ripping at the top handle after 2 mild uses.  [END]
[BEGIN] Yep, !!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice light weight.  [END]
[BEGIN] Used this product during our honeymoon. Worked very well and I received the same amount of time on this battery as I did the stock battery. It s very nice to have the 2 extra batteries plus the convenience of mobile charging.  [END]
[BEGIN] good and light  [END]
[BEGIN] I like these opera glasses. They fulfilled their promised, but I do wish I could have gotten a higher magnification.  [END]
[BEGIN] Didn t come with directions, pretty easy to figure out though. Got the job done.  [END]
[BEGIN] This light is massive produces minimal heat for a CFL. and great to add light to my aloe plants :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Super cute! Can t wait to do our 6 month pictures with our little man!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product for the price. It also came with a portable bag to carry it around. Its very convenient and lightweight. Great for any kind of angles.  [END]
[BEGIN] They work wonderfly when you re using them but trying to fold them up and put them back into the protective sleave is a pain. Otherwise it s a nice product to have.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have not had the time to try all of the capabilities of the Nikon D3200 digital camera, but so far have found it easy to use and adaptable, resulting in excellent pictures.  [END]
[BEGIN] The case is nice but it is a bit hard to get the micro cards to stay in the foam. However, it got me to Africa and back and kept the cards clean and dry.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good for Linear systems. This remote will NOT work with Genie Garage door openers.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good price. They just go way to quickly especially when using the wifi. I have 6 batteries in constant rotation to have any fun making vids. Dual charger is a must have as well...  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great. Good image quality!  [END]
[BEGIN] they were better than I actually expected them to be  [END]
[BEGIN] works wonderfully i would recommend this version of the GoPro over the fancy versions with the LCD viewer and WiFi just as rugged without the added cost  [END]
[BEGIN] its light, easy to setup, easy to store, and holds a background up.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is all you need for your Go Pro Spare battery and charging kit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Got it as a replacement. it works nicely.  [END]
[BEGIN] works good  [END]
[BEGIN] Good recorder for the price  [END]
[BEGIN] It does the Job just right good price vale  [END]
[BEGIN] It does the macro job! focusing is quite challenging though.  [END]
[BEGIN] It stopped the jellow on my phantom 2. So I m satisfied  [END]
[BEGIN] So far all of the accessories work as expected EXCEPT for the selfie stick. It s horrible quality and will not hold your GoPro without rotating around. Trash the selfie stick and buy a better one if you really need one (I didn t).  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good buy. Gets the job done for the most part.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love my camera backpack took it to Costa Rica and was perfect for traveling!!  [END]
[BEGIN] too expensive...  [END]
[BEGIN] I had to get a second strap in order to be able to have a strap around my neck while using the camera. So far that means there are 2 straps on the camera and I haven t figured out a better way. Otherwise, I am happy with it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good  [END]
[BEGIN] Great lightweight tripod!  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well, lightweight, compact, storage case. The top bar bends a little, but that s to be expected from an adjustable bar.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great lighter weight 35mm camera. Excellent photo quality with the function to email a photo to anyone with a computer or phone. Photo correction program although limited has a good editing program. Great lense selection of which I have five.  [END]
[BEGIN] The description states that this contains a lithium metal battery. It actually contains a sealed lead acid battery.  [END]
[BEGIN] A good product.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great light, works as advertised. However the battery backing pops out easily if you re not careful. Not the worst problem to have all things considered though. Great for getting a little extra fill light on indie film sets where time and resources are limited.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good. The angle for the camera needs to be better though. Have to wear them funky to get the camera straight in front of you. Make sure to get vlc media player or the correct codecs or whatnot for the avi file.  [END]
[BEGIN] Came fast works as advertised.  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything worked as expected. I would purchase again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great and as described. Interesting that I didn t receive a wall charger for it though. Only a car charger? That s the only reason for a 4 star. No wall charger.  [END]
[BEGIN] They re a bit fragile but they can do the work, I use them to hold my reflectors and bounce cards. I like the tips because you can flip them over to adjust the grip.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very comfortable. Item as described.  [END]
[BEGIN] They work as advertised and working good and great products  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product looks like it can hold and stand the test of time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well. the cover/protectors are a nice value-add  [END]
[BEGIN] Rad  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheap, compact, takes decent video. Not giving 5 stars, because the battery capacity is terrible, and the battery fits entirely inside the cam, meaning larger aftermarket batteries are not possible.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works for me!  [END]
