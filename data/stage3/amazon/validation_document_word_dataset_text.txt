15259 4 fits cannon rebel well 
15260 4 great transaction. Product as described 
15261 4 was excatly as described. 
15262 0 The remote battery seems to be dead. It does not work. 
15263 4 Worked fine 
15264 2 Having trouble getting adequate focus for my eyes 
15265 4 works great! 
15266 1 Did not fit my Canon 5D Mk III with the stock 24-70mm. No battery grip. Decent build quality, but could not use. 
15267 4 very good on batteries, recommended 
15268 4 Benjamin Ward Excellent product and technical support. Would recommend. 
15269 4 Works great 
15270 4 Exactly what I wanted, and it works well. Convenient also that it can be reversed on the lens for storage in my camera bag. The on-board surface helps in reducing eliminating glare inside and outside the hood. 
15271 4 Perfect camera. 
15272 2 It works fine...good cost compared to others out there. Not a big fan of the BLUE strap but it works and easily replaced if need be. 
15273 4 It s doing what it s supposed to at a great price! 
15274 4 A great lens that I use on my Nikon d750. If you like a heavy, large lens this is the one for you. Photos are outstanding. Most pleased, by clearly if you want something light and small you may want to look elsewhere. 
15275 4 easy to install and add to sell phone nice you can look inside your home from your sell phone 
15276 3 it s a re-purchase 
15277 3 Good quality regardless of zoom setting 
15278 3 I really like the camera, but can t get the pictures off of it onto my laptop. And I don t know how to use the items that came with it...cause no manual came with it. 
15279 2 This projector is really good for the price and is easy to travel around with however i didnt recieve and hdmi cord to connect the projector to my computer and i dont like that,now i dont know which cord to buy 
15280 4 for this Price i was waiting almost a toy.. But are a Really GOOD product. i can compare this set with set of 35 us. 
15281 0 Didn t come with instruction booklet, but that was easy enough to find online. Doesn t hold charge, and randomly shuts of my phone. Don t waste your money. 
15282 4 Worked very well. Definitely needed the charger and extra batteries. 
15283 4 So far this along with VIDEO SURVEILLANCE SECURITY SIGNS Sign burglar- robber- thief video warning... has kept intruders from attempting to break into the back door of our garage. 
15284 4 Excellent camera but the speaker has some static. 
15285 1 It is not fitting to my d5300. 
15286 4 Great price and great item 
15287 4 They charge fast and work great. 
15288 4 I bought this camera ages ago - not sure why I wasn t asked to post a review then... :) Anyways, it s a good piece and I ve only had to invest towards getting the SD card compartment. 
15289 4 By reading the instructions before anything else, my first film worked great. I haven t finished my first film pack yet but so far it s worked just how it should. I m actually going to buy again after finishing this pack. 
15290 4 Excelente! 
15291 0 Only received 50 shots. Two of the 20-pack and one of the 10-pack. The clear packaging even says &#34;50 shots&#34; but they placed their own sticker over the top which says &#34;60 shots&#34;. Not cool. 
15292 4 It works. 
15293 4 So many fun facts noted in this book. 
15294 4 I am very happy with this battery :) 
15295 4 Good cable. Just as expected. 
15296 4 My wife really loved this camera! 
15297 0 Read the instructions upon arrival, you are directed to an icloud account to change camera settings, whereas the competition includes the software to monitor and change settings without the cloud account. I am sure it performs well, 115 degrees vs 126 by the competition. 
15298 4 The tripod is perfect for my needs. Compact and pretty sturdy considering its size. 
15299 4 Just as described 
15300 4 Very good product. 
15301 4 Does nice job. 
15302 4 This was plug-n-play with my NVR. Good picture on the test. I will update if that changes in actual operations. 
15303 4 Great! 
15304 4 these work too 
15305 4 REALLY GOOD, INCREDIBLY EASY TO FLY 
15306 4 Arrived on time and as described 
15307 3 Not like I had read but seller was great and a full return 
15308 4 good product 
15309 4 Fast service, simple! 
15310 2 battery does not last long enough 
15311 4 This is a definite must if you walk much with a heavy camera. This sling allows you to grab and shoot, never having to remove the sling. I use it at flying events and its perfect. 
15312 4 Works great. No problems. 
15313 4 Works as it should. 
15314 4 Excellent 
15315 4 Bought this with an extra 50mm lens. Love it so far. The extras that came with this bundle was like icing on the cake. Really happy with my purchase. 
15316 2 Flash is great but wireless adapter doesn t transmit TTL so it s useless. I couldn t even get my camera to trigger with it. 
15317 4 Love the cameras (3) of them. The picture is amazing. Vincent was amazing at his job and vary patient and professional. Thasnk you for your product. 
15318 4 Great product! 
15319 3 Really great for the price.. 
15320 0 Confirmed, bought this from Frys.com and had the exact same experience. It s unforgivable since I needed this for a special occasion and now I m hosed. 
15321 4 Very useful for my situation: OMD EM5 body plus ep3 body with 40-150 and a few primes: 75/45/25/14. The top compartment carries my headphone wallet and stuffs. Stylish outlook. 
15322 4 it iss exactly what i expected 
15323 4 Perfect for the C11. 
15324 4 very good 
15325 3 With Foscam support set up was fast. This is my 4th Foscam and I like the picture Quality of all of them except for the outdoor Infrared is hard to clearly see anything. 
15326 4 Smooth transaction. A+++. Thanks!!! 
15327 0 Horible I didnt get all the sheets. 
15328 4 great deal 
15329 4 works fine on pentax. would buy again 
15330 4 Very complete kit and everything I needed to get started 
15331 4 I love this lens. Amazing sharpness, great quality build. My new favorite lens. I ll buy another. 
15332 4 So far so good. They charged properly and work just fine in my D3200, 
15333 4 Great value, love it. 
15334 4 Great product. Works fine with different branded flashes I own and my Sony A7ii as receivers 
15335 4 Seem to work just as good as the Go Pro batteries but are MUCH CHEAPER 
15336 4 Absof****kinglutey awesome. the batteries stay for many many hours of research. i personally talked with the manufacturer and he was more than happy to help with my questions about integrating the array into my system already! 
15337 4 Perfect fit 
15338 4 Awesome 
15339 4 Fast service. Great price. Great product. Could not find anywhere in our town. Thank you 
15340 3 I really like the look and feel of this case. It isn t a perfect fit, there is a bit of room in the case, but with the screw at the bottom it holds nice and tight. 
15341 3 It is a good tripod. It s not as sturdy as it should be, a little too light weight. But overall, a decent purchase. 
15342 4 great product 
15343 4 I love this camera! I have a bigger digital camera but this is much easier to use. Digital zoom and can work with one hand. Bought this for a cruise where we can only use fixed lens. 
15344 4 Stand was great and very easy to put up and break down. Would definitely purchase for future backdrops again! 
15345 3 When used with various Lowepro bags and their utility belt, this is a great way to distribute weight and reduce the strain on my shoulders (already an issue with two Nikon DSLRs). 
15346 0 Actually it gets no stars! Am returning it shortly. Can load no photos from any source! 
15347 4 Good bundle and lots of extras included. Camera is great. Phots could be larger. 
15348 4 easy to install and do the job... 
15349 3 Good cameras and I did drawback does not have a particular site cameras for surveillance of mobile 
15350 4 Easy to install. Very good product! It works Very well! No regrets!! 
15351 4 Exceeded my expectations. Literally plug-and-play and very easy to set up. No frustration at all. I was up and running before my wife finished cooking dinner. 
15352 2 The animal frames are actually longer than pictured, and the circle frames are too big for the film, so the polaroids would actually fall out... The frames look equally sized in this picture, but they re not in real life. Cute frames, but not super high quality. 
15353 3 Nice unit. Was easy to program the Radio and Access. Keep in mind this doesn t support rolling codes. 
15354 4 Very high quality and compares perfectly to the Canon version. Adds noticeable weight to the camera, but not in a bad way. 
15355 3 This is a little snug for our camera but it does work. 
15356 4 Its awsome 
15357 4 Works perfect, you don t have to worry about your phone drowning! 
15358 4 good 
15359 4 really love it 
15360 4 These disks work miracles when shooting outdoors, it really helps get softer light when you don t have helping hands! 
15361 4 Well made piece 
15362 4 what power 
15363 0 Not for phantom 3 as described 
15364 4 Wonderful purchase...speedy delivery! 
15365 4 Great Kit 
15366 4 Fit in my camera nicely. Would recommend to a friend. 
15367 3 Lens is great. Cover arrived damaged, one of the latches was broken. 
15368 4 Very good product Works perfectly. I use it almost everywhere I go. Stunning video quality And just a fraction of the price of a GoPro. Can t beat it!! 
15369 1 Going back! Could not get the unit to recognize the transformer after numerous battery changes and 4 adults trying to program it. 
15370 3 The remote works fine. It s cheap built but works. The only problem was the manual that came with it belongs to a different unit. 
15371 4 Fits perfect 
15372 4 Incredible lens for the price! 
15373 4 Great price for 2 basic reflector umbrellas 
15374 3 great product fast delivery 
15375 0 This filter does not fit my camera, a Canon PowerShot SX530 HS. My mistake? 
15376 2 Believe item does not show sufficient authenticity. Would flashing light indicator help? Present location of camera is not in well lit area. This probably a deficiency. 
15377 4 These work great! 
15378 4 It really is 50 inches long, It is very light weight and will hold a phone perfectly. Won t tip over it can adjust it to loom up but not down. This is a great tripod for a amazing price! Definitely buy this tripod! 
15379 4 This has the quality you would expect from a Canon lens. Built solid and works great! 
15380 4 fits everything and the extras too ! 
15381 4 This tripod is very sturdy. I was caught up in a windstorm and the tripod and camera blew down. No damage to the tripod. Very easy to adjust and seconds to unpack and set up. 
15382 4 Good and portable 
15383 3 This is the second one I ve bought. They are great to take on location, easily packed with other film gear, very compact and it does the job of holding various size flexfills. 
15384 4 Great price love it feels very professional 
15385 4 As described. 
15386 0 junk! had bought a pair similar to this at BB years ago and they worked great (lost them)......these are just junk....never worked at all 
15387 4 Is perfect 
15388 4 This item allowed me to use 12 old filters from another camera, at a great price. 
15389 4 For the price you can t beat these binoculars. Not a big fan of the eye piece, still trying to find a set of shade out cups for a better fit and less glare. The clarity is good, adjustment is easy. For the price they are awesome. 
15390 2 As described but not the best 
15391 2 Works fine with GoPro. Feels cheaper and lower quality than real GoPro batteries. 
15392 4 Exactly what I wanted at a great price! 
15393 4 Easy to install and the position of holes to align the adjusting screws are accurate. 
15394 3 Works as advertised. Not sure what I can say about it. 
15395 2 As advertised. 
15396 4 I bought this as a gift to compliment the GoPro Black which I bought for a friend. He loves it and will use it on his trip. 
15397 4 Great person, I hope you live forever 
15398 4 Works as expected with the Nikon D750! 
15399 3 Awesome! 
15400 1 Cute design but it ripped in half already after me just opening it for the first time... :( 
15401 3 Great flash for the price 
15402 4 ok 
15403 4 This is a great system for doing close up photography. Very versatile and I ve been getting fantastic results, Highly recommended! 
15404 3 Good quality camera that is plug and play on the Swann 7200 series recorders. Night vision is very good, with a reasonable infrared LED array. Day vision is outstanding with good color and good balance between light and dark (shadows). 
15405 4 Nice little tool for the GoPro, very handy. 
15406 4 Backpack is holding up well. I put a dji phantom 3 drone inside with accessories along with go pro and point and shoot. Everything fits well and is protected. Good quality pack, very comfortable to wear. 
15407 4 Great deal. All of these are great quality, and worked perfectly. Packaged really nice as well, the case is an added bonus. 
15408 3 Love it! Ita a bit weird looking when not zoomed especially with a visible frame shot. Macro part works great. Cool carry bag. 
15409 4 It s perfect and really liked it. 
15410 4 Recommend this product 
15411 2 For the price the camera can t be beat. Performed as expected and the accessories which Listed as 90 minutes get about 60 min out of it.came with it work seamless. 
15412 4 its ok 
15413 4 Very good no problem for me 
15414 0 Garbage, does not do anything it is supposed to do, especially take video. 
15415 2 Love got it for my step daughters bday it was a hit does everything she needs it to do! Got here late and I paid extra for two day was my only knock 
15416 4 These are great. They let me use less expensive 3rd party batteries.. 
15417 3 good product for the price 
15418 4 Essential. I much prefer the two handled model. 
15419 4 Works great! It has almost 3-5 seconds delay on the relay mode and it is black and white at night. 
15420 3 I find this cam suitable for my purposes. I found the connection from wall outlet to camera, and to camera to USB to transfer recordings tedious,but other than that,good for the price. 
15421 4 Quicks ship, great service, both items work great. 
15422 0 This item s color is NOT what is pictured. It s really really orange, not brown at all. 
15423 4 Fit my Nikon 52MM AF and AFS lenses perfectly. it is always a good Idea to keep a few of these on hand and at the price you would be foolish not to 
15424 4 Nice product! 
15425 4 The bag is very spacious, camera isn t very stable, but everything else is secure. I would purchase this item again if I had to. 
15426 4 Perfect replacement for the lens caps that I seem to set down and forget everywhere I go! 
15427 4 Works better than my old higher priced item. I like that it uses simple AA batteries also. 
15428 3 There are some scratches. But It is a good price. 
15429 3 Works well with my older analog PTZ cameras. 
15430 0 This battery is a lemon. I bought it for photographing my trip to Europe and it simply did not work. When I charge it .. The indicator shows it s fully charged in a few minutes , however when I put it in the camera it s dead. Serious letdown. 
15431 4 This have worked out great. I ve had them for about six months now and they re in great condition. Definitely a great price for such and excellent product 
15432 2 Too noisey 
15433 4 Great for astrophotography. 
15434 4 Great product 
15435 4 Prompt delivery. Superb product. 
15436 4 Love this lens! This and my 55mm f/1.8G are my favorite and most used! 
15437 0 Does not work. 
15438 2 This worked great at first, but the mask was uncomfortable after the second or third use. I developed a knot and a bruise between my eyes and couldn t use it half the time on my diving trip.Not worth the $50 in my opinion. 
15439 2 Gift 
15440 4 Great bundle. I ve used most of the mounts from this and have had zero issues. 
15441 4 Twice the life of the standard battery of my hf400. 
15442 3 great 
15443 4 Love it and a lot less that Canon 
15444 4 fast shipping and just as described. Fit perfectly thanks 
15445 0 Won t Auto-focus with the Tamron 70-200 2.8 on D5200 works with 55-300 albeit very poorly. 
15446 0 It broke right away and we cannot return it... ITs junk.. 
15447 4 Fantanstic 
15448 4 LoveIt. I can video a whole wedding none stop! 
15449 4 Very nice, high quality and crystal clear. They work great. You can buy these with confidence in the Vivitar name. 
15450 2 Batteries just don t hold charge very long. 
15451 2 good 
15452 0 I was unable to get this due to coupon code issues wish this program recognized that 
15453 4 Gets the job done. Perfect for a amateur like me. 
15454 4 Works great at a better price than GoPro... 
15455 4 They work well. 
15456 4 2 additional years for less than the already low $19.99 they charge? Sign me up. It s a no brainer that if you get a Pentax you get the extended coverage. No complaints. 
15457 3 My camera fits perfectly. Haven t had it under water though. Tough and durable. 
15458 3 I like it as I longed for this one, but it is tad tight when put it on. I had to be extra careful when putting it on and taking it off. 
15459 4 It holds up well to the Nikon brand. I have been very pleased. 
15460 4 Very nice camera, very easy to set up, clear picture, I recommend if you purchase to spend the time to familiarize yourself with the settings. Also you install a 64gb micro SD card instead of a 32gb card. The phone app works really good for this camera. 
15461 3 Tripod is actually very stable and well built. Holds my Canon EOS 70D with minimal effort, I can, for example, shoot time lapses and have no issues. Overall it s a good product and it comes for a decent price. 
15462 3 performs as expected, good quality 
15463 0 One of the engines broke 
15464 4 Nice camera! It takes beautiful pictures. 
15465 4 Works well 
15466 4 worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks. 
15467 4 Worth my money!!! 😊😊 
15468 3 Works great but mostly displays in black & white in low light conditions indoors. 
15469 1 weak that all 
15470 3 hands free video recording 
15471 1 Eats batteries 
15472 4 like it 
15473 3 Great lens and arrived quickly too. Fit my Olympus perfectly! 
15474 3 It works as advertised. I don t like that the battery only lasts about 45 minutes. Oh well, it was made cheaply and in China. Nevertheless, it serves my needs. 
15475 0 IT DOES NOT FIT IN THE CF SLOT OF THE NIKON D4 BUT IT WORKS IN NIKON D3 
15476 4 Awesome! We use them as baby monitors in addition to an Angel Care monitor and love them!!! 
15477 4 Excellent quality and perfect fit, really helpful in my last beach vacations! 
15478 4 cute borders! and they aren t flimsy. happy with my purchase 
15479 4 Does what a polarizer is supposed to do 
15480 4 One of the accessory the go pro need 
15481 2 Works 
15482 3 I haven t used it long enough to really know it s reliability but, it was at a great price, it shipped quickly and with no hassle. 
15483 3 Worked good. Inexpensive. 
15484 4 Excellent quality, highly recommended 
15485 4 Works great. Very affordable. 
15486 4 This case is very sturdy and the pockets are ideal not only for GoPro accessories but for other cameras as well. The net zipper pocket can hold a lot of stuff as well! I highly recommend this case! 
15487 4 I like it and good for the price too 
15488 3 Perfectly adequate CPL. No detectable loss of sharpness. but some graduated loss of brightness. I recommend multiple exposures at different rotations to see the results. 
15489 4 sturdy, good quality and a decent camera bag, can fit flashes and well organize 
15490 4 This is one of the best filters on the market. The threading is cut beautifully so I do not get that grinding feeling when taking it on and off like I do with other brands. Coating is flawless. No splotches or inconsistencies like some other MultiCoat UV filters. 
15491 0 Terrible customer support. Extremely difficult to setup. 
15492 4 Works great. 
15493 4 Works well and it has a car charger, which my original one did not have. 
15494 4 The P900 has far exceeded my expectations!i use it literally everyday. I have taken over 3000 pictures since getting this camera and can t believe the quality and capability of this camera! I take pictures of the moon everyday as well as the sunrise/sunset. Couldn t be happier! 
15495 1 Okay fit and finish, but the scale starts from the wrong end! Only really useful if the scale starts from the center of the camera, so that numbers are transferable to other setups. 
15496 4 4 hours recording and am out of 64Gig memory and still have just under half the battery remaining. Baddest batteries on the planet!! 
15497 4 Good camera, as I expected! 
15498 4 Just as described. Works great on my Canon 5Dmkiii. 
15499 4 This is a well packaged collection of must have tools to keep all aspects of your camera clean. Love the carrying case since it allows me to get everything together and it does not take up much space in my camera bag. 
15500 3 Nice case but save yourself some money and go to Harbor Freight. Exact same case is $25 or less there. 
15501 2 Not bad... Attachments were all too loose to hold gopro in on position but if you leave the bolts in the attachments very tight, it should bend the fittings very so slightly and make it work. And nothing is stainless so think twice about getting anything wet 
15502 4 I had the tough job of organizing my parent s photos. This book was perfect. I ended up buying several because they had so many photos. But for the price, these are very nice photo albums. 
15503 3 seems to attach correcto to nikon g lenses the manual aperture ring it is not so good as in a nikon manual lens good as comparison of other cheaper brands, not excelent 
15504 4 I am OBSESSED!!!!! 
15505 2 A little bit big for the Speedlight SB-500, you have to push it hard to fit well so does not falls 
15506 4 Love this product. Now I have three batteries for my GoPro and never run out on a trip. 
15507 4 Awesome and works great!!! Super fast shipping! 
15508 4 Filter works good, Gets the job done and protects my lenses.,also the vendor was great. 
15509 4 Very good 
15510 2 Nikon P610 Charges with this cable which is what I really needed it for, but does not work for data transfer. Would be nice if it worked to download pictures but at least it got my camera functional again for cheap. 
15511 4 As promised, works fine. 
15512 4 Speed! This lets you fire one after another on your speedlites/flashes. No more changing out the batteries every 10 minutes on your speedlites. Doesn t fit 430 EX II 
15513 4 I have no problems with the Syma X8W. I am just a horrible pilot. It is fun to play with. 
15514 4 I love this camera. I ve owned a lot of Nikon cameras in my life and this beats them hands down. Great camera! 
15515 0 Images are skewed or cut off, will not shuffle photos properly 
15516 4 Fits my 6d perfectly. Looks even better on it than the original piece. Great purchase. 
15517 3 Very Nice product but does not work in low light if thats what your looking for. Simple to use! 
15518 0 It did not work when it came in. 
15519 4 Works very well. Very pleased. 
15520 4 I lost my previous set of filters I had purchased at a camera shop. These are the same make and quality at a much better price, and easier than hassling the drive and parking. 
15521 4 Awesome security system! no problems at all. good for the price as well. I have recommended to several family members as they wanted one for them home. 
15522 4 Amazing lens - I was using the kit lens prior on my FS100 and holy cow this made a huge difference. If you are debating on wether this is the lens to get for a true 35mm on your E mount camera - go for it. 
15523 4 Item is as described. Reasonably priced. Well packaged. Completely satisfied and works as advertised. 
15524 0 Not very useful, it covers the wheel button to where it is very difficult to use it. It doesn t really provide that much protection either. 
15525 4 Very nicely made & easy to adjust & use. Olympus tough cameras are heavier than gopros but I tried it walking and with the stability system in the camera it seems to be just fine. Working up the courage to take it surfing..... 
15526 0 Printer won t connect to my android phone what can I do. It won t let me enter the default password. I ve even reset/restarted the printer and my phone but still doesn t work. Can t rate right now if product isn t working. Need some help 
15527 4 lenes works as well I thought it would 
15528 2 Very good picture and works well. Reliability is an issue. One out of five I purchased was DOA. Another one died after a little more than a year. 
15529 4 I was very upset when I left my extra camera battery and charger behind on vacation. I thought getting replacements would be expensive. I found this on Amazon for a great price. It works just fine and you can t beat this price! 
15530 4 Fast delivery very happy 
15531 4 I purchased this item for a friend who is extremely happy with this quality product. 
15532 3 Nice camera. Fairly easy to navigate, decent imaging, raw photos. I took photos of the moon and with breathtaking results. Zoom works great. 
15533 4 Exactly as described. Was surprised this was actually the go pro brand when I got it. Woked great when I jumped off the rock in Hawaii. 
15534 4 Small, perfect for a GoPro. Even fits in my padded GoPro case. It s a small Tripod so read the dimensions before ordering. 
15535 4 Great!!! 
15536 4 have two nice & smooth holds well with pentax k5 & sigma 150&500mm lens& grip 
15537 4 great 
15538 4 A very light weight option for when you are not fighting the elements. Works great on a selfie stick. 
15539 4 Does just what I wanted it to do, protect the camera. 
15540 4 Portable, easy to use, does the job perfectly - no complaints. 
15541 4 I love these. I have ordered them twice. I especially like the size as so many of the cloths are tiny. 
15542 4 Housing looks great compared to the original clear housing. I have a all black motorcycle helmet so this was really needed. 
15543 4 Easy to operate. Getting good quality video. Very pleased. 
15544 4 Works fine. In order to prevent &#34;memory error&#34;, format it as FAT 32 and make the SD card as Primary Disk. 32 GB SD memory works fine on this. 
15545 4 This is my fourth Breakthough Photography Filter. You won t beat the Quality for Twice the Price. 
15546 4 Fast shipping and correct product! 
15547 3 Great buy 
15548 4 the kit seems to be what i ordered and i have clean lens now 
15549 4 Very sturdy, quick and easy set up 
15550 4 I got a lot of electronic devises in this bag for my trip. The bag is made of very nice material and looks nice. 
15551 4 What s not to love. This lens is aweswome 
15552 2 I guess this product is ok. It barely holds my I phone 6 without it popping off. 
15553 4 Have had no issues. Looks exactly as pictured.Pictures are the quality you would expect from a polaroid. 
15554 4 Just what I wanted... :) 
15555 0 Um… I never bought this… Yet it showed up in my Review your purchases … Mystery! Nothing charged in my name or on my account. I m sure it s a quality product, though! :D 
15556 4 Excellent product! Just what I needed for my lenses for an overseas trip. Fast delivery (sooner than promised!) and great price. Definitely highly recommend. 
15557 4 Works as described. I use it for cleaning my computer screen. 
15558 4 Used for snorkeling with the Go Pro and worked like a charm 
15559 4 Great product. Very clean and professional packaging. I used 3rd party software to configure my monitor instead of the included one, but works amazing. Would recommend to others. 
15560 0 This is a total scam!!! The adapter wasn t working at all!!! No specified 8V 3A output! It is a cheap crappy product, don t buy it! 
15561 4 Nice 
15562 4 Great security system, easy to install and pics on camera of surveillance is amazingly clear! I m impressed! 
15563 4 A little thin but over all its perfect for what I am looking for. 
15564 4 great 
15565 4 This kit works very well with my Coolpix camera. It has all you need. 
15566 4 So far so good. No issues in water. Product seems very rugged. Battery life is iffy. Buy some extras and keep them on hand. 
15567 4 Works great and comes with a ton of mounting options 
15568 2 Not bad for the price. NOT DGI. Product says DJI Phantom Prop Guards. DJI Is oddly similar to DGI. Coincidence? Product was OK. Fits Phantom 2 fine. Seems sturdy enough. Fulfilled by Amazon so no waiting for them to come from China. Not bad for $7.50 including shipping. 
15569 4 Great for carrying filters and it also carries my wireless remote for the camera. A lot easier that using the camera bag. Everything is right there when I need it. 
15570 3 The kit es very good, the antenna need s upgrade beacouse the range is poor. 
15571 4 great lens 
15572 4 Great Product 
15573 3 Ok. Its a bit complicated to use 
15574 3 Excellent for use with Lazes Levels.Very light weight. 
15575 4 These shorts are so comfortable, I don t want to take them off lol. Perfect size, not too big/not too small! Will definitely be ordering from here again! 
15576 0 Did not work when it arrived. Junk. 
15577 4 Great build quality of this charger. It fully charges my gopro in about an hour. 
15578 4 Awesome ....you can never go wrong with GoPro.... 
15579 4 works great, even in low light 
15580 4 An excellent pair of binoculars well suited for all outdoor activities. 
15581 3 Good high quality case. Very compact if that is your main focus it s the right case for you. If you want storage for more accessories you ll want something larger. Very pleased! 
15582 2 it s hard to get the top mount level/flat to take pics. it s very light which is good for transport, but kind of cheap feeling 
15583 0 DO NOT BUY!!! Charge lasts for 2 minutes.. waste of money. 
15584 3 I finally got to open this package.I love it. It was fun to put together. However my package was missing the equipment tray. A bit disappointing. Now i have to call them and go through the process. who has the time for that 
15585 2 ok 
15586 2 its ok for beginners 
15587 3 I actually use this for Nintendo 2DS! Works great. 
15588 4 This product is so much better than previous frames we have tried. Delighted with it! 
15589 4 Huge backdrop! Easy to use. Has a rod pocket for easy and fast installation. Machine wash & dry. 
15590 4 nice packaging and product 
15591 0 Small tight fit 
15592 4 Cute and works as described. 
15593 4 It is great! My daughter uses it for her photo shoots, and loves it! 
15594 4 These lights are wonderful for my youtube videos!! And the price I paid was even better. 
15595 4 Very nice. Compact. 
15596 3 Contrast leaves a little to be desired during use in full sun light but otherwise a very nice product. 
15597 3 Bien 
15598 4 Really like it and works well 
15599 4 this camera was for my daughter who is doing a lot of photography. .She is really satisfied with the quality. 
15600 4 It s small printer which is great to print small photos. It s great product Love it. 
15601 0 Didn t work for very long. Worked exactly 2 months....now they won t take it back...very disappointed. Would not buy this product again. 
15602 2 It s ok. 
15603 4 It is excellent, is beatiful camera. 
15604 4 works like a charm!! 
15605 4 Two batteries, and a charger with car and European adapters, what s not to like? 
15606 4 Beautiful camera in appearance and function. Bought this as a gift for my wife to use for her other hobby of oil painting. She loves it, I m a hero and she uses it every day. Everything a person needs comes in the package. 
15607 3 I like this lens, I just wish that it would come with an adapter. Instead of having to purchase one separately 
15608 3 I like it very much. The only problem I have is that the monipod unwise very easy and it starts lowering. They need to put instructions with it. It took me a while to figure how to make the monitor the correct height. 
15609 4 AMazing, Bright WHITE, theres no hint of yellow at all in this bulb. Worth the upgrade in bulbs :D 
15610 4 Great deal. quite bright and easy to use. Not yet on a shooting with it. Is quite light, still feels sturdy, barn doors sturdy as well, The light stand attachment is plastic as well, but feels strong with a large knob. All in all, I m happy with it. 
15611 2 Pictures were average 
15612 3 Great protection, cleverly designed 
15613 3 Great product and the fact that you can change the settings via the remote is absolutely essential. Only complaint is the battery doesnt last that long when using extensively. 
15614 4 Excellent 
15615 4 Great Camera! Everything was included as described. Order came on time 
15616 4 Works fine 
15617 4 prompt delivery, a very good value 
15618 3 It s been working for a long while now but is still a bit confusing when you want to upload pictures to it. 
15619 4 This is definitely my new favorite lens (I have a Canon 50mm 1.4 and a Canon 85mm 1.8) Here are some of the pictures I took with it in my last trip (with a 6D) https://www.facebook.com/sebas.cantillo/media_set?set=a.10152917884986568.1073741912.561506567&type=3&pnref=story 
15620 1 Too hard to get batteries back out had to use pliers 
15621 2 The strap inside doesn t actually fit the camera. 
15622 4 So many pieces...the camera is super. Haven t tried the wifi connections yet. But the camera is wonderful. Checked out prices, wouldn t of gotten such a good deal anywhere else. Glad I purchased it. 
15623 4 Everything arrived as promised. The attachment line works well to keep me from losing the lens cover. 
15624 4 A great camera. Very pleased with all features and the sharp resolutions of the pictures. 
15625 4 Great Fit, just what I needed! 
15626 4 Great 
15627 4 Factory parts, same as the one that came in the Phantom 2 V. box 
15628 4 I am just an amateur but it works great for my purposes. 
15629 4 I was afraid it would not fit well and may leak. This thing is awesome cant wait to go snorkeling. Mask is very soft and comfortable gopro fits on it like a charm. 
15630 2 Actually, it s a nice set but I can t compare to anything...still haven t used them. 
15631 4 I liked the product, and had no trouble with the purchase. thank YoU! 
15632 3 Too big for left side mount. Only fits right side. I decided to purchased Morros brand fits and both left and right. 
15633 4 excellent product. 
15634 4 Loved this! Took it to Cancun for all my activities and went to the highest pyramid of Cancun to some of the deepest sinkholes! Through saltwater and all. Definitely recommend it. Although it did break on a skateboarding accident I would buy again and recommend to anyone! 
15635 4 Good 
15636 4 very good 
15637 4 great little camera. 
15638 0 I only bought it because of the length. It s the only good thing. No TTL no matter what I do. I have another shorter TTL cable that works like a charm, so I know it s not my speedlights. Don t waste your money. 
15639 4 This charger worked perfectly as it charged up the new battery we ordered. I am very pleased with the performance with this charger. 
15640 4 Worked as expected. 
15641 0 Full charged batteries, put them in my GoPro, immediately after my GoPro showed 1/4 battery life. I returned and purchase the GoPro official battery charger and battery. 
15642 4 Great back with just the right amount of compartments for my gear. 
15643 3 Point and shoot 
15644 4 This is great so far. It s sturdy gets to a very good height. 
15645 3 Fabulous for the money! Secure, easy to adjust with very nice strong replacement hardware for the gopro. 
15646 2 Never have been able to get it to work. What s the secret? 
15647 4 I love my go pro, well made, durable. i use it all the time car,walk,bike, any where any time. if you are really active this is the camera for you 
15648 0 Not worth buying didn t do the job 
15649 3 Really helped us monitor our front door and our dog. Really came in handy when we got our puppy, saved a lot of anxiety. Still was pretty expensive for what it is, wifi drops often, and you need to buy the service really. 
15650 4 Solid. Has been reliable for a number of shoots. I would buy this again 
15651 3 Standard camera L-bracket works well 
15652 4 This is perfect if you are a blogger. It works perfect for food blogging and product reviews. I wished I had bought this sooner. The price is amazing, and it does so much for better lighting. 
15653 0 Not worth the money. Very flimsy and bends easily. 
15654 4 High quality extension poll. Haven t used it yet, but it looks to be very sturdy. Pole extends very smoothly! 
15655 4 Item came quickly. It works very well. It is easier to travel with since one does not need a cord with it. 
15656 4 Great deal! Just make sure that you hold the top of your camera when taking off the lens because some people have ripped peaces of the camera off! 
15657 4 Perfect item to add to your kit bag. I will use for wild life shots primarily and selfie family photos as well. 
15658 4 Good stuff 
15659 4 nice 
15660 4 Nice to have protection from dirt & dust. I lost original shortly after getting the camera. Will try to be more careful with this one. 
15661 4 This thing never dies. I never had to replace anything. 
15662 4 worked great 
15663 4 Very easy to put together due to the clear cut instructions on the enclosed video. This is not a flimsy product, it is well made. Will be using the MyStudio MS20 for my photography needs! 
15664 4 I always need extra batteries for weddings and this was a great price for a back up battery. It also lasts a long time! 
15665 2 Doesn t fit around the display very well. Especially by the flash button. 
15666 4 A must have for new flyers. Will save you from a crash. 
15667 3 Great product. Very good quality. I only wished it come with a rope or some kind of handle to easily carry it. For the rest, it has enough space and certainly will keep the GoPro save. 
15668 4 Great for party favors. Kids loved them! 
15669 3 yes I feel this is a excellent / for the money is great and I love it and I would recommend it to other people 
15670 1 Beware--These are not &#34;Sony Cyber-shot Digital Camera&#34; batteries! These are AA batteries and will work, but are not as advertised. Look closely and you will see they are made by &#34;Synergy&#34; in China! Misleading description and nothing special about them! 
15671 4 Fits perfectly using the 39mm filter threads on the lens, or on a threaded filter. Color matches very well to the standard Lecia lenses. A good deal, and MUCH less expensive than the lens maker brands. 
15672 0 instructions say frame the pic but there isnt even an opening (view finder) to see where it s aiming. further, the battery lasts not even a week. not holds a charge for a week, fails within a week. 
15673 4 Perfect for CANON EOS M3 
15674 4 The picture quality is very good both on the computer and the mobile app. night vision is also ok, this camera wont disappoint any budding geek like myself 
15675 4 I bought this pack with low expectation. I just want to try out ND filters. I m sure if I like them and start using them a lot I will upgrade to a set of nice quality, glass ones. But these are perfect to learn on for now. 
15676 4 very good I love it. 
15677 4 A must for serious lighting in the field for control and creativity. 
15678 0 I got it and charged it over night then it only worked for an hour then stop charging 
15679 4 Great tripod. works just at good as my $400 tripod. Wish I bought this first. 
15680 2 excellent item, solved my problem 
15681 4 nice 
15682 4 This battery performs as specified, and is good for 2000-plus photos with my Canon 70D. 
15683 4 easy setup to the wink system 
15684 4 The product was received as displayed and in a timely manner. 
15685 4 Compact yet roomy enough for all the essentials. We travel a lot and this is just what I was looking for to keep my gear safe yet easy to access. 
15686 3 It arrived a little later than expected. For the price it s definitely worth it although it falls off sometimes by itself. This is a great product although the original for my canon camera was much better 
15687 4 I love it! 
15688 3 Best cam in market for action sports, and it has so many accessories which make it the best! the only concern that it s so expensive I guess and you might need more than one GoPro to make a good videos.! 
15689 4 excellent 
15690 4 great seller - delivered as promised! 
15691 4 Perfect for a Canon digital & just what is needed. Nice case! 
15692 4 I would recommend any product made by this company. Their products are fantastic and the prices can t be beat. High quality merchandise and prompt service. When ever I want to purchase something for my Nikon I go to them first... 
15693 4 Excelent product 
15694 3 Good deal for the price ,will recommend it to anyone looking at buying a camera for a decent price. 
15695 4 The lens filter arrived in perfect condition. 
15696 4 Camera works real good, had a technical issue, but Walter worked it out fro me. 
15697 4 Works right out of the box when you add a photo source Looks great Nice Product with lots of extra features like music and video!! 
15698 4 Works as its description. Crystal clean video, fast setting, strong WiFi signal.! Great companion with Synology Surveillance Station! 
15699 4 This stand works fantastic on my desk. It does everything I hoped for at a great price. Easy to figure out without instructions. Very sturdy and light weight. Very versatile and allows you to more easily accommodate your creativity too. 
15700 1 Not very loud at all :( disappointing!!!! 
15701 4 Great product cleans glasses,computers,tv. I had a question and they answered in hours. Cloths are placed everywhere i need them. 
15702 4 Just one word........awesome! 
15703 2 wife bought this for me last xmas. works fine for it s purpose. had some problems with the &#34;water proof&#34; case. took it into the ocean and had some leaking. camera stopped working for about 24hrs. used camera with chest harness on a 5k fun run and worked within standards. 
15704 4 Good deal 
15705 3 cant go wrong for the price. 
15706 4 Love this Drone. Kind of wish I had paid a few more bucks and got the pro version, but this one still takes great video. I would suggest getting an extra battery though. 
15707 4 This is an update to my original review...Ritz did send the items that were missing (lens filters and another freebie instead of the remote). All replacements were Polarid brand. I was very satisfied. 
15708 4 Nice product and fast shipping 
15709 4 Recommended! 
15710 4 just what I was looking more. Exceeded my expectations. 
15711 4 Fast shipping, order 100% accurate, Thanks! 
15712 4 A great product. I bought it for a relative and he loved it. He uses it all the time and it still works great. You can see things clearly. 
15713 4 Great product to use with my GoPro. We needed something to use while on our ATVs. 
15714 4 Great bundle and great device. No issues at all. 
15715 3 The product was NINB but the buttons on the remote had scratches. Other than that everything works fine. 
15716 0 Broke/Fell apart within literally 30 seconds. The build quality was horrible. 
15717 4 Love this camera. It was recommended to me from a photographer friend as a good lower price range camera to start taking professional looking pictures with. It takes great sports shots and beautiful up close pics too. The bundle it came with had lots of great extra s too. 
15718 4 Light weight and durable! Works great with a GoPro! 
15719 4 ❤️ Them so cute 
15720 4 Outstanding battery and seller!!! 
15721 4 GOOD PRICE AND PRODUCT 
15722 3 Great price. 
15723 2 The battery seems to be working correctly. The battery casing was coming apart when we opened the package but I super glued it and it seems to be holding so far. 
15724 1 The ball joint swivel does not lock very well, and the legs don t bend out evenly, some legs bend more and cause it to be uneven. 
15725 4 C6721625 - AROO4273 - Thank you Henry for your help - very knowledgeable about the camera I purchased. 
15726 4 Just right! 
15727 4 not perfectly fit but does its job. 
15728 4 These lenses have allowed me to take great photos with minimal effort using a cell phone! Highly recommended. 
15729 3 Great bag for the video camera 
15730 4 very useful stick. great for GoPro and phone and camera. I ll bring it to europe with me 
15731 4 photos developed great, really nice product 
15732 3 good tool works for me 
15733 4 Batteries.stay charged battery charger is light weight and can fit in your pocket. If you need an extra or lost yours Great set for the price 
15734 0 Had a bad experience. I will stay with the 70-200 2.8 is VERSION 1 
15735 2 does not charge other gopro batteries. 
15736 4 Worked perfect with my Phantom 2. 
15737 4 very easy to install and it looks nice having a new eyecup on my Nikon D90. 
15738 3 looks good 
15739 4 This camera is great and reasonable price for many components and camera. Also, it is proper to beginners who don t have deep knowledge about camera. 
15740 4 Awesome camera for an awesome price!!! The quality is unbelievable! I love the fact that the cam has a speakerphone, so I can talk to my dog when I m not home. Super quick five minute set up, and you re ready to go. Awesome awesome awesome!!!! 
15741 4 Good product. Everything as promised. 
15742 4 Best speed lite I have ever had! Was very user friendly! 
15743 2 Okay 
15744 3 it works well 
15745 4 Works as needed for extra power at a reasonable cost. A good buy. 
15746 4 Surprisingly good quality for the price. 
15747 4 Love it it s isn t really big but it is great so you can have all your pics in one place 
15748 4 It was easy to figure out, Now I can enjoy video chatting with my mom much better that putting it on top of the computer. 
15749 4 No problems with product and/or delivery. Works with camera as described. 
15750 3 You get what you pay for, sure there s better selections. But this works for me during a dive or snorkeling. 
15751 1 ok, but very small. 
15752 3 Pretty good for the price. I usually take filters off when photographing but put them back on for protection. Polarizer is okay 
15753 4 This arm supports my 7&#34; ikan monitor very well. If your rig s rails are already crowded, you can detach the arm from rail support and connect to any 1/4&#34; thread. For me, I connect it straight to the BMPCC Smallrig cage and hang off to the side. 
15754 4 none 
15755 4 Great product for doing video recording. 
15756 4 Great item!!! Helped me during E3 2015 
15757 4 great size of case to fit into a backpack!!! 
15758 4 Fast shipment. Easy to install..... As advertised 
15759 4 Fast and perfect.. Thanks 
15760 4 Set up was so easy. The image quality is great. And the remote use via iPhone is very good. We re very happy with the Nest Cam. 
15761 4 THis has allowed us to scan in pictures that could have been lost forever from times of our childhood. 
15762 3 A little pricey, but works as designed. 
15763 4 Perfectly fits the DJI Phantom 3 PQ Drone. Its the safest way to transport our Drone. 
15764 4 Pouches are excellent. Just buy em, you won t be disappointed. 
15765 0 Does not work well at all. 
15766 4 Much more power than battery that came with camera. 
15767 0 I have an FD 50mm 1.4 lens whose aperature will not open all the way with this adapter. There is an adjustment on the lens that will allow me to fully open the lens manually but then the adapter won t fit. Frustrated... 
15768 4 Excelente 
15769 2 Great case,the postage was outrageous 
15770 4 Cool! 
15771 4 Cool 
15772 4 Small enough to keep in my truck, so I can use when I really need it. I filled mine with rice, and it provides a good, stable rest for my DSLR and telephoto. 
15773 3 Nikon lens have a good performance, i love take pictures to distance that allow show a close up with wide background scenery. the delivery was on the provided time 
15774 3 Stronger then most. Can hold larger cams. 
15775 4 A great camera! The accessories included are pretty cheap except for the digital cards, but I have no complaints. Thanks Amazon and The Imaging World. j 
15776 4 This camera is amazing, I made wonderful pics under water , I recommend for everyone, and enyoy you memories en your pics 
15777 2 Great quadcopter, I was practicing using it in my house, and it was very easy to control. Took it outside, you can t tell which way is forward when it s high up in the sky. It flew away, out of range and I never saw it again! 
15778 4 It rocks 
15779 1 The video quality is poor. It looks like I am looking at a Sonogram. I am opting to rent a video line from Home Depot 
15780 4 I like it 
15781 4 The battery works perfect. I didn t have any fitment issues like some of the reviews I ve read. Definitely recommend the product for the price 
15782 4 The shipping was fast and the dedication from Amcrest to provide help and satisfy your needs is extremely nice. As for the product itself, the camera quality is really good, the image is nice and clear. The installation and setting it up and getting everything functioning was also insanely easy. 
15783 4 Very nice camera. It works well for what I use it for, it does some nice close ups but you got to be patient and wait for it to focus to get great photos, glad I bought it. 
15784 4 This is a great little quad. It s easy to set up and fly. For a beginner, I would recommend buying a crash set, with the prop guards, to go with the quad. 
15785 3 This is a good replacement part, not quite as solid as the Nikon hood but it does the job. 
15786 4 Excellent. 
15787 4 This is the perfect little light for the job. I needed some indoor pictures of a two-week-old baby. It is just the right light for the job. 
15788 3 Awesome little compact for my Camera. I didn t really use the solution or tri pod though at all needed the charger and spare battery which work great. 
15789 3 they work 
15790 4 Great and affordable bundle for the GoPro! Completely worth the money. However, it didn t come with instructions but if you just check out the GoPro website it is easy to figure out how to assemble everything. 
15791 4 I haven`t yet tried the audio, so...nothing to say there,others all ok 
15792 4 This little beauty adds more ways to enjoy my Go Pro camera. I clip it onto my backpack strap and I can instantly record anything I want. It s also very inexpensive and easy to use. 
15793 4 great 
15794 4 Not exactly what I was looking for but works well 
15795 3 Can be a little finicky and takes a long time to boot up, also does not find my wifi internet source on first try, but once it is up an going... This thing is a real gem. Better than any other streaming device I have used. 
15796 4 very good 
15797 1 If I was home I could connect but not 10 miles away sorry I had to return product. 
15798 4 On time, very good 
15799 4 Great deal! 
15800 3 I like the look of film 
15801 4 Good selection of mounts at a great price. 
15802 4 Great piece of hardware especially for the price. Using two of these to support an SB900 and a SB700 
15803 4 Still the best of the best 
15804 4 great camera 
15805 4 If you have a nex-5 you need this view finder. It takes your camera and your pictures to a whole new level 
15806 3 Works great, just what I needed for my camera. The batteries stay charged for a long while and I take my camera on the road so it s very important. 
15807 4 Amazing, just love it 
15808 4 Works as advertised. 
15809 4 Give it to my grandparents, they like it. 
15810 4 Works great looks great 
15811 4 good 
15812 3 ok 
15813 4 Great 
15814 2 it s ok 
15815 4 It s what I expected. 
15816 4 Amazing Lamp & Price! Light is bright and is a great investment for my job! Lighting is important for my studio and this just did the trick! 
15817 4 GOOD. 
15818 4 My students are really interested in the solar system and in reviews, this product, albeit a tad expensive, looked the best. We were not disappointed! Large, easy to assemble, looks amazing. 
15819 0 Had it for less than a month and already the wifi won t work and the car won t charge (the light doesn t turn on when charger is connected). I need to check if there is a warranty on this thing. 
15820 4 exactly what i was looking for. Helps organize everything and more. GoPro Hero 3 black edition. 
15821 4 Great fit! 
15822 3 Good protection and lightweight. The cover doesn t come with hardware to connect to strap when removed so you either have to hold it or place it down while taking pictures. There is a material loop which I was able to connect to strap with a binder ring. 
15823 4 I Love this little camera. It meets or exceeds all expectations 
15824 4 Got this for my gopro hero 4 and it works perfect. Awesome little case and we ll built and great quality 
15825 4 Great product from a great seller 
15826 4 just what my camera needed,, 
15827 4 Light works great. Came with easy to read instructions. Took a couple tries to get it to work, but once I got it. it was easy. 
15828 4 A great lense!! I have only used it a couple of times but definitely one lense I will take with me everywhere! 
15829 4 Awesome case. Highly recommended!!! 
15830 4 works perfectly 
15831 4 Great glass for the money. Can t beat Vortex for quality versus price point. 
15832 4 This is a great little camera! I like going to the Pacific Northwest rainforests so it is nice to have this along and not need to work about it getting wet. Takes awesome pictures too. 
15833 0 This is the worst product I ever bought Colors are not coming out after cleanning them twice it starts printing and after half a page it goes back to give horrible results 
15834 4 I purchased this as a gift to my husband for his birthday. He loves the camera. It also has a great video function, and records nice, clear videos. I would buy this product again for myself. 
15835 1 It s ok at best 
15836 4 Works great. 
15837 3 Good product. 
15838 4 Super fast delivery, product is awesome and works great. 
15839 4 Easy to install. Works as promised. 
15840 4 Awesome ! 
15841 4 Can t wait to get mine. The reviews sound great. Best part, I was concerned of it fitting my Sony A100, as it is not listed. But, one review was of the A100. It s on my wish list, can t wait. 
15842 3 Smooth transaction. Fast shipping. A+++. Thanks you!!! 
15843 4 Fit perfectly, are easy to use, great price, and there are three of them! Can t beat that! 
15844 3 Worked as advertised. 
15845 1 Battery runs down too quickly. Does not record very much 
15846 3 worked great right out of the box 
15847 4 exactly match my tripod, official product! 
15848 4 We really love the images this camera records. Works perfectly now that it is setup. We mounted in the kids room and the image quality is fantastic during daytime or night time. It is nice to be able to control it remotely. Now we can get images anywhere we go. 
15849 4 Super handy 
15850 4 This is just the cord that I needed. My original is packed away in a POD and I wasn t able to charge my camera. Am now back in business. Thanks for the prompt service and perfect product. 
15851 4 Very pleased with quality and ease of use 
15852 3 Good! 
15853 4 I ve only been using it for a couple weeks, but it seems to work as advertised. Very happy at this point. I like the feature where it will recorder over the oldest videos if the disc is full. 
15854 4 Love this battery! They will run a lot longer than the OEM batteries which is important when you re right in the middle of taking pictures. 
15855 2 Just eh......I don t like how the plastic insert that holds the camera stuff keeps coming out. It is just over priced. The top section won t stay closed. I mean it works......but I wish I got something else. 
15856 0 It has a very bad resolution and it is very difficult to add or delete pictures. It is definitely not worth the money 
15857 2 I m reasonably happy with these batteries. I knew they would not match the OEM battery in usage time. 
15858 0 Returned after I got it. The picture quality was bad. 
15859 4 I have used these a few times. Like them a lot. Great for getting close up pictures without having to buy macro lens. 
15860 4 I m a professional videographer who routinely gets through an entire day of shooting on just one charge with this battery. I keep the OEM battery in reserve. 
15861 2 Have only used in the pool but works well. Wish the lanyard had its own mount hole but not a deal breaker. A low cost insurance policy when filming in and around water. 
15862 4 Great product. Use it for cleaning eyeglasses. They are larger than typical cloth used for glasses which makes it easier to use. 
15863 4 perfect! 
15864 3 Great Product 
15865 4 Works great 
15866 4 Great camera and the pictures come out awesome. 
15867 3 easy to fly,but battery does not last 5 min 
15868 4 Fits tight and keeps debris off the lens. It does not touch the lens surface when installed. I wish it had a lip so it would restrict how far it could be inserted. 
15869 4 Worked Great!!!! No fog like other cases. I went under about 13 feet without any problems. Clear pictures and all look amazing! Also, it float, so you can just put put the strap around your arm when swimming. 
15870 4 Excellent !! 
15871 4 Still learning how to use this. My brother loves his just like it. 
15872 4 Quick shipping, just as described. 
15873 3 Great lens. I use this lens for just about everything. The focus ring could be a little smoother as it tends to jump out sick when using the manual setting. Buy yourself a lens band, or a broccoli rubber band because it s weight causes constant lens extension... 
15874 4 VERY GOOD. 
15875 3 They made it right... a mishap corrected Thank you ! 
15876 3 Works really well...I just wish it came in better packaging so I could store it more easily. 
15877 4 fun and stylish 
15878 2 Makes noise while setting the focus, even in manual mode. Unfortunately, makes it impossible to record sound on the camera. 
15879 3 Internal charger in Kodak PlaySport bit the dust so found this as the replacement. Brought my PlaySport back to life in short order. 
15880 4 A fantastic flash at a fraction of the cost of the top brands. A solid buy for any photographer. 
15881 4 Awesome more fun than I deserve!! 
15882 4 perfect 
15883 4 Fits and works well. Panasonic should include this adapter as part of the camera rather than selling this as an accessory (since I believe that this was a faulty design at the beginning) 
15884 4 Can t beat the price 
15885 4 This bundle was actually cheaper than the just the price of the camera alone on another website; got a lot of extra stuff for a lower price. 
15886 4 Great 
15887 2 Finally got to try it, due to broken arm. Not what I expected. Don t know about t lens & was looking for more of a close up view. 
15888 3 great price/original nikon battery 
15889 2 not connected with wifi 
15890 4 I tried it with a37 and a65. Fits well, works fine, no problems, so far. Price was good, free shipment, and came fast. 
15891 0 This cord did not work and I was not able to return it 
15892 4 Good quality product. I recommend. 
15893 2 GPS is hard to use. Needs more match markings for barrel. 
15894 4 Ty 
15895 4 Love this! Seems to be very high quality, and for the price, it can t be beat compared to GoPro branded accessories! It has a VERY strong clamp, and the neck is very bendable. I m not sure why anyone would spend the extra money on GoPro brand stuff! 
15896 4 I am in love with this camera and my kid finds it very fun too. 
15897 3 Just fine 
15898 4 Works as advertized and certainly beats the high price of true Panasonic batteries. 
15899 4 purchased in 2010 for a Lumix and its a perfect fit and rigid 
15900 4 These provide good protection for the front lens element. I use Xume magnetic adapters, so I can have them on and off in less than a second. 
15901 4 Great cameras, work real good and clear. 
15902 4 Good case, protects your camera, and it looks chic and stylish 
15903 4 The best! 
15904 3 It s a great cam!! 
15905 3 So vintage and unique. The snaps on the back (the cover flap) come off too easily though. I am keeping it because it has such a warm caramel color to it! 
15906 4 Works as needed and is well made, what else is there to say? 
15907 4 Worked great in Romania! 
15908 3 best deal for the money 
15909 4 Very effective lens cleaning cloths. 6&#34;x7&#34; size is good and they are a good value as well. 
15910 4 Strong, solid, well made. I use them in my kit to hold my flashpoint streak lights, even at 90 degrees on a boom arm they are solid. 
15911 4 Good! 
15912 4 Good quality 
15913 3 This was a cheap replacement for an existing system. Q-See is fine for the home grade quality surveillance systems. Easy to set up and has a mobile app. Will work with most bnc cameras. 
15914 3 just received it ,but so for I like it 
15915 4 Absolutely outstanding. 
15916 4 This is a great product and works great with my GoPro, would definitely recommend this product and have had nothing, but a good experience when using it on my vacation. Seller was great and package arrived on time, as described. 
15917 4 Works like a charm 
15918 4 Great 
15919 4 Saved the day when the rain came!! Really easy to put on and coud keep taking pictures. Make sure you can the Pro version as it is the one with the velcro closure at the bottom. 
15920 4 great product for charging three GoPro batteries at one time. 
15921 4 Good product n easy to set up even if you are not an expert 
15922 4 Solid product. I was surprised at the size. This is a large case. I ll attach it to the outside of my camera bag. However it s designed to protect really expensive filters and protection matters. I have to get use to the size 
15923 4 Went windsurfing with it, and i didnt worry at all about my phone! It is an iphone 5c and I let it float with no problem. 
15924 4 Quite inexpensive and it delivers. I am surprised at how good the images are it produces. I would not hesitate to use if for professional applications. And the macro feature is very good too. I would recommend this lens to anyone. Russ 
15925 4 Great Tripod keeps my camera in place especially when I do portrait shots. Nice and lightweight easy to handle. 
15926 4 Henry at Foscam did an excellent job in assisting me with setting up my new cameras. He was very patient, methodical and explain what he was doing. I have had foscam cameras for 3 years now and have never had a problem with them. 
15927 4 Works great in camera, batteries charge up and camera works fine, again. 
15928 4 Received as described and promptly! Good quality and price. 
15929 2 It fits and all but it would be so much better if it was reversible for storage. 
15930 4 For the price you cant go wrong. This gives you the details you re looking for. 
15931 0 Yes it was used and had all the stuff, but it failed to operate. The code it was throwing was researchable on Google, but the fix listed didn t last. Sent it back for a refund. 
15932 4 No issues with the product or delivery 
15933 4 Perfect fit for my newest Canon Camera 
15934 3 Flys really good. Just wish it had more flight time 
15935 4 I m very pleased in how fast I received my order, I ordered the camera on Sunday and had it Tuesday morning, as we were leaving for vacation in Cancun and I wanted to use the camera under water. I ve played with the camera and so far so good. 
15936 4 Very good 
15937 4 Good quality camera for the price I wasn t expecting such a good picture I would buy again 
15938 4 Great bang for the buck. Works great. 
15939 4 Absolutely LOVE this thing. It s so cute and compact and easy to use. I ve already gone through most of the film I ve bought. I m going to use this for a guest book at my wedding, so people can include a picture in there &#34;words of advice&#34;. 
15940 4 So Far so good. Cloths are big, and I have enough for all my glasses and sunglasses to last for a couple of years! 
15941 4 Handy little wrist strap. I use it for my Canon G12. 
15942 3 So far it has worked well and the price was definitely a bonus for something of this quality. 
15943 4 Kind of big but its a great flash. I was very nervous to purchase, but glad I did. I use the front led light for nightlife photos. Helps a great deal! 
15944 4 The color,contrast and sharpness are great, I love how closeup it will focus. Feels solid, I have it attached to my OMD EM5 II - it seemed a little heavy and stressing my right-hand, so I purchased the optional grip and now it feels much better. 
15945 4 camera has great color and clarity 
15946 4 Works great, just the accessory needed 
15947 4 Works well for my small business. I even have one outside for back door security. 
15948 3 The result is awesome. Plain and simple. Is it crazy harsh light? Yes. It s continuous lighting so of course looking at the sun will result in some temporary blindness. Am I slightly exaggerating? Yes. See the picture :) 
15949 4 Love this frame, it is easy to use and easy to set up and has wonderful clarity. I wouldn t buy any other brand. 
15950 3 Love it! :) 
15951 0 More of a colorful child s toy than a useful instrument. NO focus after a literal few feet. They are ALL like this. WASTE NOT your monsy. Worthless as well in warm weather. 
15952 3 I have barely began to use the lens. So far excellent. 
15953 4 Item fits on my two lenses, works well. 
15954 4 just what I need fo macro photos 
15955 3 Smelly when I first got them, but I put them on my porch for a week or so and smell is gone. 
15956 4 Its fun, you get exactly what you expected, a different way to use your DSLR, also you get 3 macro, so you dont need to buy another product to play with. You also need to use it in lighten places, and on manual. Thats all you need to know. 
15957 0 Don t buy this. I am not able to close my screen completely after applying this. It s not fit for the d5300. Now this company wants me to explain the way I installed a screen guard. It s really pathetic. 
15958 0 This cage DOES NOT fit the a7rii. The battery door does not line up and the top dial is severely blocked. Good build quality however, just wish it fit like it claimed to. 
15959 4 Light work awesomely!! Have to take pics for my business website and boy do they light up!! Received them as expected, great packaging too! 
15960 3 Camera takes very nice pics. This is a very reasonable bundle. 
15961 3 great item,you can charge a battery. instead of using you camera. fast charging good battery too.great addition to your cam setup. 
15962 1 Honestly, spend the money and buy a quality UV filter. This one left my images all very fuzzy and streaky. I ended up taking it off my lens and the images were 10 times sharper. 
15963 0 did not come with a power supply. other customers said the same thing AFTER i purchased. o well. it is going back! 
15964 3 nice product 
15965 4 was exactly what I wanted. Worked perfectly on the device 
15966 4 Fast shipping great value everything you need to get started 
15967 4 Awesome camera works perfect and its easy to use 
15968 3 Great for viewing sun spots. Was hoping to see more than just sun spots, but maybe I m not using it correctly. Not sure if it s possible to see sun flares or other exciting events. 
15969 4 Bought the rotary slide tray,as I had a Sawyer slide projector given to me,but had no slide trays. The slide tray was given,along with the projector,to my relatives. And yes the slide tray was in perfect condition. 
15970 0 Basically no useable directions, and not user friendly at all. I can t even tell if this thing is broken or if I m not using it right. Definitely don t waste your money. 
15971 3 Battery works fine. Doesn t seem to last as long as stock battery. Still a good a cheap alternative. 
15972 2 NEED TO SEND BACK A $200 BATTERY THAT DOESNT WORK 64 GB MEMORY CARD DOESNT WORK EVERY THING ELSE WORKS 
15973 3 Clearer at night than day. Night vision is outstanding. Camera is bigfer that what was expected but very happy with it. 
15974 4 Gift for my mom and it works great. 
15975 0 poor quality. top button doesn t go all the way in. hinge is very poor quality. comes off so easy. 
15976 0 never worked. in trash it goes 
15977 4 best value I have been able to find. 
15978 1 It s an attractive bag but it s not constructed as well as I had anticipated. 
15979 4 incredible offer! 
15980 4 I was very happy with my purchase. Had a trip coming up when I ordered it, and I came in very handy, having extra charger and batteries. 
15981 4 Really Good !!!! 
15982 4 the best deal in cameras ever ! i own two and want more. 
15983 4 easy to hook up well made 
15984 4 These rear lens caps fit the lenses snugly and are the same quality as the Sony covers received with other lenses. I m purchased these go to on the Sony 28mm f2 lens which did not come with a cap. 
15985 4 Like it a lot, but wish I had spent the additional $$$ to get the 55-300mm instead. Probably would have been worth the money in the long run. 
15986 4 I believe in good metal screw-in lens caps. They stay on and are more difficult to lose. I ve used these since the late 1960s. 
15987 3 does what I wanted 
15988 4 Extremely pleased with the product. Arrived just in time for my trip to Southern California where there is just too much light. The filter did an amazing job in places like Palm Springs, Joshua Tree National Park and the Salton Sea. 
15989 4 This id the perfect screen protector for the Nikon D5300. Buy iy and you will like the protection it gives the display. Good price also. 
15990 4 Thank you, splendid item! 
15991 4 Very Nice will enjoy 
15992 4 it is goood!! 
15993 3 Camera came highly rated and did not disappoint. The only drawback was no manual but I knew that beforehand 
15994 4 Super sharp, not too heavy. Only thing missing is IS and anyone who buys this goes in with eyes open, so there s really not much to complain about. 
15995 4 I purchased the 2.5 amp version at the same time I purchased my 8&#34; Schmidt-Cassegrain and realized that the power was not sufficient. I purchased this supply subsequently. I like the addition of the screw connector on this model. 
15996 3 Canera excellent some of the accessories are of questionable quality but time will tell. 
15997 3 Pretty neat device with remote controlled pan and tilt. I used it while I was on vacation to look around the house and it worked pretty well in day and night. 
15998 1 I was unable to get the motion detection to work properly, despite moving the cameras to many different locations, and trying front-on and sideways motions in front of it. I returned the package to Amazon. 
15999 3 Does a good job of keeping on my shoulder. Not sure if much more comfortable than the wide canvas strap bag already has, though. 
16000 4 Love the boarders... 
16001 4 LUUUUUUUUVED IT!!!!!!! 
16002 4 Very well made product. Good value. 
16003 3 Great deal! 
16004 4 No problem at all. Meets all expectations. 
16005 4 Very Good Product 
16006 4 Met my expectation.and it s works good on my camera. Described as I received the right product. 
16007 1 Got camera without Instruction Manual in English. Please send me an Manual in English language. Regards, B. Jezdic 
16008 4 I was tired of the pantry light with a pull chain and this wireless wall switch was the perfect solution. It was easy to install and works perfectly. I love it and would definitely recommend this item to anyone with a need for it. 
16009 3 Nice camera and very easy set up. Works as well as expected. I will purchase more of these. 
16010 2 does not tighten properly. falls off camera every now and then. one shoe that does not have a stop fitted,has a tendency to have the product mounted to it,come off. 
16011 2 Thicker than your average Compact flash beware if your device has strict dimensions as mine did. 
16012 3 took a moment to understand the new lens attaches directly to the old lens not directly to the camera. Works well and does improve the zoom. 
16013 4 Great binoculars. This is the second pair I ordered. Very easy to adjust and the magnificatiuon is great. 
16014 4 Best Camera I have EVER had! Superb. Small, fit in small crossbody purse I had at Disney...and the photos are great. Easy to use and better Zoom than my previous &#34;Big&#34; camera. Will never buy anything but Samsung again! 
16015 4 Excellente item, excellent quality! 
16016 4 Excellent. No trouble staying on my D750 like the original failed to do, and seemingly the same style and material. 
16017 4 Works perfectly 
16018 3 pics arnt Fantastic, but there good 
16019 4 Love it! Great lens 
16020 4 Works well 
16021 4 Very good filter. 
16022 4 Does the job, love that camera! 
16023 3 Thanks 
16024 4 It works perfect. 
16025 4 A low cost alternative to Zacuto products, for certain things. 
16026 4 I bought this as a gift for my fianc&eacute;. Last summer I purchased the mini neo instax camera for his birthdays. I thought this would be a nice accompaniment. He absolutely loves it, and it works remarkably well. 
16027 4 Hard to find item. Glad to get it at a good price! 
16028 4 it s like a camera pillow for your eye hole. 
16029 3 Fit well on my gopro hero 4 silver. Everything I expected and will try them diving soon. 
16030 3 rec d as promised and as advertised 
16031 0 It is hard to rate this item since the battery that came with the camera was defective ( would not hold a charge ) and I could not replace the camera. 
16032 4 LENS produces excellent IQ. Priced very reasonable. Iwould buy it again. 
16033 4 awesome you just have to be gentle with it or it will possibly break 
16034 4 Great product! Gave as a gift , used onstantly! 
16035 4 Just what was needed for trips. 
16036 2 This item works fine as a screw-in lens hood, except that it only adds about 7/8&#34; out from the threads, not really much shading. Mine actually looks skinny relative to the one pictured. 
16037 4 Very nice camera. I really love it. Now if I can learn to use it a little better. 
16038 4 Worked very well! 
16039 2 Ok, fits well, looks nice. The unit I got had a mark down the middle. Looked like it had been scored by a box or box cutter when shipped. Arrived in time for our trip and looked good while protecting the camera. 
16040 1 The umbrellas that come with this are decent but the rest of the kit just screamed super cheap. 
16041 4 Quick response and a gfood product.Favorably priced. 
16042 0 Very Cheap And Defective. 
16043 1 too small for my canon 100-400 lens and camera shame, it was nicely made 
16044 4 Very good quality and versatile. 
16045 4 Great accessory especially for longer shoots. Slight learning curve but worth it! Keeps weight balanced and distributed to both arms! Definitely helps with arm fatigue!!! Been using it with my canon 6d. Its Small, lightweight and well constructed! 
16046 4 Awesome pair of binoculars for the price. Super clear, easy to hold and focus. Great buy. 
16047 3 Very satisfied with results of this product as of today. Received an excellent support from vendor with a couple of issues with installation. I would buy it again. 
16048 4 The battery charger arrived in no time at all! It works great and better than the original charger. Just in time for my vacation pictures. Thanks so much for the timely delivery! 
16049 4 good quality, exactly what i expected 
16050 3 This case carries all of my GoPro equipment. I love the color and material. Very handy when going on trips. 
16051 4 great camera and easy purchase 
16052 4 It is working like a charm on slides from the 60 s & 70 s! 
16053 4 I love this, it has everything I need until I can find the bag with all my accessories. 
16054 4 love this camera 
16055 0 Different from what is described and from the product pictures; mind did not have the white rubber grip stripes. Judging by other reviews, its seems that there are many version of this product. 
16056 4 Works great! 
16057 4 Very nice camera, all I wanted and more. 
16058 4 This thing is AWESOME! 
16059 4 good product for my go pro a real must at times. Thanks!! 
16060 0 Total JUNK!! Do Not Buy!! It would not connect to wireless router plus when you finally have the camera hooked up through wire but then screen shows up black no pictures!! 
16061 4 good 
16062 2 nice toy, impractical. Better get rx100 and connect it to phone 
16063 4 Love this little set up, I ve had it since 2011, I use it often and take it out on location too! 
16064 4 Fits my neewer vk750ii speedlight, a little loose but it will work. 
16065 4 Everything it said, everything works great 
16066 4 I bought this camera to peek in on my cats when away. It worked just fine. I didn t get the model that zoomed but if I were to purchase another I would get that feature. Good picture, easy to install and view. 
16067 0 This doesn t fit the Neewer flash at all. It s too small. The description says it will, but it s too small, even after trying to bend/shape it a bit 
16068 0 Poor quality and did not work effectively. 
16069 1 love it perfect 
16070 4 Perfect 
16071 4 Worked like a charm 
16072 4 I use these cloths to clean all types of things-cell phone screen, computer screen, eyeglasses, etc. A rainbow of colors and handy to have all over the house. This is a great value. 
16073 4 Great backpack! flew with it as a carry on no problem light and nice 
16074 4 I m enjoying this as a reliable camera with auto settings -- good pictures and easy to use. 
16075 4 Works great on Nikon DX AF-S Nikkor 18-55mm 1:3.5-5.6G ED. Took about 30 minutes to remove the old part and install the new one. 
16076 0 I bought this battery for my Nikon D3300, It did not work with my camera. Its not made for working in a Nikon camera. 
16077 3 Good sized bag. Fits camera body and two small lenses. Great for using when I m out on my bike. 
16078 4 Fast delivery. High quality. A lot of fun. Just buy and enjoy. 
16079 3 Great Kit for reverse lens macros! 
16080 4 perfect! 
16081 4 Perfect!!! 
16082 4 Thank you for the replacement of the remote control it work on my Canon 70 D thank you very much I appreciate for your kindness 
16083 3 great bag just wish it was a tad bigger 
16084 4 Vincent was very patient and helped solve my problem. Thank you 
16085 3 Very nice camera for non-professional! Easy to use and good results. 
16086 4 Love the camera! The quality is really nice, me and my bestfriend do vlogs and its the perfect mini dslr! Great buy! 
16087 4 Cowboy Studio does it once again. This backdrop is perfect for on-white photos. One side is almost luster, while the other is glossy. Its easily cleanable and stores nicely. 
16088 4 Works great! Just what I needed for my canon rebel camera. 
16089 3 good fit 
16090 4 Clear picture quality for price. Highly recommended. 
16091 3 Happy with it simple installation good picture quality i could see my house from anywhere anytime 
16092 4 A great addition to my collection. I highly recommend it. 
16093 4 Great, works fine. 
16094 4 Amazing quality for the price :) I was pleasantly surprised and WOW the shipping was lightening fast! 
16095 4 ok 
16096 4 I have one and need a second one, so I purchased again. Works well with the batteries for my Canon EOS M. 
16097 4 it brings life to my flash light!! love it! a must-have. 
16098 3 I got this for my camera so that I could use for my phone. It does fine!! 
16099 0 I ve had this for less than a month and it has already broken. What a waste. 
16100 4 great belt 
16101 4 quality product 
16102 4 I am just getting back into photography and love these little helpers. As I get better I will put them inside my camera bag but for right now I keep them very close at hand 
16103 4 great product 
16104 4 Very good remote control. Works well with my Canon camera. 
16105 4 Flawless. 
16106 4 Works well. 
16107 4 absolutely love it!! so nice to have two batteries charged at once and the graphics to let you know status. 
16108 1 For fun is ok but You ll get what you pay. Can t compare to GoPro lol 
16109 1 I bought this tripod to support my iPad. The mount I bought attached no problem but this tripod is not strong enough to support the weight of the iPad. Even when it s all tightened it droops down. Very disappointed! 
16110 3 Nice case. My Pentax K-30 fits pretty well, even with my longer zooms. It could be a bit too small for an SLR with very long lenses. 
16111 4 Great little tripod 
16112 4 I absolutely love this film and the price is unbeatable compared to others. 
16113 2 I am huge guy but still stripe is too large. I have it tide up to max but there is still a lot of space and possibility to slip from my wrist. 
16114 4 This is a great lighting kit. So easy to use.Well made. 
16115 4 Exactly what I was looking for! I immediately discarded the clamp that seemed weak compared to GoPro s version. I attached it directly to my kayak and now I get some great shots. Affordable too. 
16116 4 The quality of the monitor is good; it does come with a F970 battery plate and works perfectly; the overall design is compact and nice, good workmanship. 
16117 3 I guess it s a great product, never really used it. 
16118 4 Great pad 
16119 4 I received my frame one week ago. It was very easy to load and has worked perfectly since turning it on. The picture quality is very good. I would definitely buy it again! 
16120 4 Works really well so far. Good features. 
16121 4 I absolutely love this lens! It s perfect for macro shots of flowers, portraits and it s even great as a medium range zoom lens! I d definitely recommend it! 
16122 3 Fits PVS-14. I understand the right thread is 30.25, but the 30 is loose and this is tight. I like this better. 
16123 4 Very nice, great lens! 
16124 4 Awesome camera and lens package. 
16125 2 Item is scratch on the screen it look heavy used (not used only twice) as advertise missing Lens cap, dusty in side the Len but it is functions, next time better buy new don t trust the advertise. 
16126 4 will order more when I need it 
16127 4 Great price for a really decent tripod. 
16128 4 The floats worked great. i checked them in my pool and they kept all my cameras from sinking. i liked the fact you could use the quick disconect to go from float to regular strap 
16129 3 A cheaper plastic not sure how it will work under pressure or in water 
16130 3 Didn t pay attention to the fact that the camera is rechargeable. I don t always have the power supply to power up again on the road. Otherwise, it is a small, functional, and easy to use camera. 
16131 4 As expected 
16132 1 I suppose 3.5 stars would have been more accurate. Only one of the batteries worked. The other we only found out was a dud until after the 3-day return period had ended. 
16133 2 Just as advertised. My only wish would be for it to be little beefier so that it can hold a reflector at any position set. 
16134 4 Very good package. I recommend. 
16135 0 It does NOT have night vision and it DOESNT connect to my iPhone waste of money and time 
16136 4 Got these for fathers day and really think they are a great pair of glasses. Very sharp images and easy to focus. 
16137 4 Works very well. 
16138 4 Why waste $ on Go Pro? 
16139 4 great buy, batts last long, lightweight and portable. 
16140 4 love using it have gotten great results 
16141 4 Love it 
16142 0 We wasted our money on this one. It did not work in our camera. The camera did not recognize it. 
16143 4 Takes a steady hand but with careful installation and clean area the shield works fantastic! Fits perfect and is invisible on the camera. 
16144 4 Great product, easy to use, super clear and simple to focus. Can t believe they are discontinuing this product 
16145 4 Perfect as usual. You can trust Tiffen and save money too. 
16146 2 The filter often come off when changing the hood. Should have bought more. Can see hood in some zoom in shots. 
16147 4 Easy to use! 
16148 3 So far so good, great storage for my Phantom 2. Fits snug in the bag with H3-3D Zenmuse attached, quality is decent. plenty of room for accessories like batteries and tools i need like small hex screw and phillip. 
16149 0 No it s not working I needed return it? 
16150 4 Super easy to install and my test shots show a nice improvement over direct flash without the shadows caused by bouncing it off the ceiling. Definitely a nice option to have in my arsenal. 
16151 4 I was a bit leery when I realized exactly how lightweight this tripod was, but was reassured once I tried it out. Admittedly, my photography is mostly indoors; I don t know if this thing could stand up in a stiff breeze, but for my purposes it s perfect. 
16152 4 Great design and easy to use 
16153 4 Superb...A plus 
16154 4 Henry at Foscam tech service helped me set up remote access to the camera and everything is working as expected. The quality and price are great and it serves my purposes very well. The tech support person was very knowledgeable and addressed all my questions. 
16155 4 Very happy. 
16156 4 I am still leaning to use these but I highly reccomend them 
16157 1 Big, bulky 
16158 4 good 
16159 4 Wow, I should have gone to 2 inch viewing long ago. 
16160 2 works well but if you have the extender arm unclamped a small pin can fall out and make it unusable. Just remeber to keep the clamp locked at all times 
16161 4 Super cute camera! Doesn t include any film though. 
16162 3 Great product! 
16163 4 fast shipping and the replacement was great 
16164 4 A good product. 
16165 4 The camera was more than I expected. Great buy for the price. Also, the support and service was way above expectations. I would highly recommend Digideals4less. 
16166 4 This tripod is better than expected! It is light weight, but very sturdy and easy to use. Great company to work with, great product and great price. Thank You!!! 
16167 4 so it s good I like it but it don t pause so use WINDOWS MOVIE MAKER to merge vids 
16168 4 Great camera works as expected. 
16169 4 Arrived when promised, charged it up, put into my camera and it worked superbly. Thank you STK. 
16170 0 Does not fit my battery. I have to &#34;tape&#34; it down just a certain way, in order for it to work. 
16171 3 Very Good 
16172 4 I can now recharge my battery (or spare battery) inside or in the car. Good set. 
16173 4 Great deal, works great. 
16174 3 This thing is awesome, very straight forward. A bright LED attached to a heatsink. The ONLY problem with it is that the fan is too loud for audio recording... but what I m doing is buying a good case fan ($15 max) online and swapping it for a quiet one. 
16175 4 Exactly what was needed. works perfectly 
16176 3 It s a good buy for the price ..only thing tripod is the cheap model 
16177 4 Outstanding image quality 
16178 1 Went dead before I could even use them. They need to be uses as soon as they arrive. 
16179 4 I love this lens. Such a great deal for the price and the images are so sharp. Produces a wonderful bokah! 
16180 4 They get the job done for fair price. 
16181 4 VERY CHARING AND PROMPT... 
16182 0 Poor quality - juddery. Nylon slider guides seem to have too much friction to be useful for video work. 
16183 4 Works fine 
16184 4 Great product. Easy to use and very efficient. 
16185 4 These things are worth their weight in gold! 
16186 4 AAA+++ 
16187 4 Excellent product. Works perfectly at a big discount on the Nikon product. 
16188 4 Cool bag! Lots of compliments. Outside is almost too nice to accidentally scuff. Inside is very firm foam. Zippers...holy cow. Weather resistant and you can feel it when you use the zippers. Very resistant when used. Inside of lid uses entire lid and zips closed to use full space! 
16189 4 This is a great camera for saving memories. I highly recommend it. 
16190 4 An excellent, easy to use and sturdy table-top tripod--- works well with the FugeTek selfie-stick I also purchased. 
16191 1 [[VIDEOID:76a1a54ded862b79ccdd6f8e1362a7c8]] The product arrived on time, but one of the bulb was damaged. Tried resolving with seller, but could not. 
16192 4 great for my strobes and speedlights for the price 
16193 2 Its a good starter telescope,it does not have an adjust handle and you can only look at the moon 
16194 4 Great extension for outdoors surveillance camera. 
16195 4 It was nice 
16196 3 Almost perfect. Needs a closure for the inside (battery) pocket. as is, the battery falls out when removing camera. I will need to sew-in a Velcro strip to secure it. 
16197 3 Great hidden camera. 
16198 4 I borrowed one before I bought this, I liked it and it works well for a cheaper option, I haven t noticed that double circle you get with some of the other cheap ones. Good for the money 
16199 4 A bit heavier than I had thought but not too bad. Easy to use and takes excellent pictures. I was looking for a lens for shooting wildlife without having to pay for a pro level lens and this one is perfect. I highly recommend it. 
16200 4 Nice package for a good price. Although not evident from the photo, the charger and batteries are produced by Vivitar, a name I have come to trust over the years. Seems fully compatible with the Olympus camera, charger, and battery. 
16201 2 Love this camera. Takes great photos with a faster shutter. With an add bonus of using AA batteries. 
16202 4 I m really excited to take up this new or almost new hobby to be more than a hobby I dont know. I might not be like a Grandma Moses but I think the enjoyment wiil out way any bad things that might happen I expect lot s of fun 
16203 4 A good looking case, just fits my Nikon 3200 with zoom lens, but it fits and it works. Well constructed. 
16204 4 I bought this ring to use my 58mm filters on my 52mm Canon 24mm pancake lens. It works exactly as described, and the quality is top notch. The included cloth is a nice touch as well. 
16205 4 excellent 
16206 4 This grip is a lifesaver. Makes holding the camera so much easier. 
16207 4 These are simply wonderful!! The feel of the microfiber is really great &amp; they work nicely on my items. These are so nice I used the first one and placed it back in the plastic holder it was in...I ve never done that before with any other cleaners. 
16208 4 After getting hosed by a hobby shop in Detroit, I did what I should have done in the first place. Fast shipping, exactly as described. Thanks guys! 
16209 2 Good except the portion that holds the camera is flimsy. I just use it for my iPhone and it can barely hold that. 
16210 4 Works great! 
16211 4 Used at my shop door I installed facing down and do far -great! 
16212 4 This has made a large difference in my ability to manually focus my camera. Well worth the extra cost. Only gripe is that is sticks out a little more, but in a short while, you wont notice. 
16213 4 keeps it dry... 
16214 4 Nice for the price. 
16215 4 This is awesome camera... 
16216 4 Excellent camera, the LCD screen makes it easy to use in situations where the camera isn t on a mount. 
16217 4 Wonderful product!! So easy to use! 
16218 4 quality product 
16219 4 I LOVE IT! 
16220 4 LOVE IT 
16221 4 Great little charger for home or auto. I have not charged the batteries, but look forward to taking this on our road tr vacation 
16222 4 Jonathan Reed from foscam tech support was very helpful in getting me connected remotely to the camera. 
16223 4 Just what I was looking for. Works as it should. 
16224 3 Does what you would expect, protects you lens 
16225 4 So handy and a better option (imo) than buying the instax camera. 
16226 4 Keeps the light out of the view screen, fit my D70s perfectly. 
16227 4 Excellent 
16228 4 Love this film! So stinkin cute and a really good deal! I use it with my Instax mini 8! 
16229 4 Great camera to keep an eye on things in your home when you travel! We bought it so that we could see our dog while we were gone! 
16230 4 That is a nikon lens. It should say it all. Perfect quality, Pictures come out perfect !!! Great lens for the price. 
16231 4 This product is handy, great purchase! 
16232 4 Does everything as advertised, an amazing machine. 
16233 4 Just as described, delivered quickly. 
16234 4 I ve not used any of them yet. Ordered them for a party. They are cute though. 
16235 4 Awesome lens love it on my camera 
16236 4 Henry fi9826p great help very good 
16237 4 Did not realize this shipped from china directly, so shipping took a little longer then expected. Overall a good product though 
16238 4 Great product so far 
16239 4 thank you 
16240 4 It s great having spare batteries for my camera! They work just as well as the original and the charger will charge the original battery. 
16241 3 I was very pleased with the camera and most of the equipment included in the package except the slave flash. The slave flash is extremely poor quality, the battery cover will not even come off so that i can try it out. 
16242 3 A bit expensive but ok 
16243 4 A very sharp lens. The camera is filled with features that move it past the usual point and shoot. 
16244 4 Very nice 
16245 4 Purchased this for my son for our Florida vacation! Was skeptical buying this unit. This little GeekPro is amazing. The quality of the video is awesome. It is worth every penny. Great product! Highly recommend! 
16246 4 Its a spare battery. Seems to do the job 
16247 4 Does the job, and the package came with a cute pink stylus and something else I m not exactly sure what it is. I think it s some kind of mini stand for a phone? 
16248 3 Great buy, especially for those that need the power. Pack has been going strong since purchased in 2007. I would highly recommend. 
16249 4 Awesome product 
16250 0 It doesn t work. 
16251 0 worthless. cameras stop working on first day. no warenty. 
16252 3 Excellent product 
16253 4 Great product. 
16254 0 Not good, cheap quality, come without instructions in an envelope. 
16255 4 Works fine! 
16256 3 Better than I thought 
16257 3 It s what I expected 
16258 3 Works extremely well and a great alternative to OEM batteries 
16259 4 Came on time. Works perfectly. No problems at all. 
16260 4 Exactly what we hoped it would be. Large viewing screen and clear picture. Love it. 
16261 1 This lens took ok pictures, but the build quality left me wanting more. The body was loose and rattled and the aperture ring did not adjust consistently. Because of this I returned the lens and will be buying a rokinon. Hopefully the quality is better. 
16262 4 Love it! 
16263 3 It s an OK bag. It s really nicely built, but it s not as big as I expected. I was looking for a larger bag than what my Canon EOS 7D came with. I will use it in place of the Canon bag. 
16264 4 Excellent pictures. Easy setup. 
16265 4 Cheap and works as it should! 
16266 4 Very good case, perfect for my camera. 
16267 4 These batteries work perfectly I my D3200, and the charges last a bit longer than the OEM battery that came with my camera. The car charger works great and will recharge a battery quite quickly, as does the wall charger. The chargers also will recharge the OEM battery. 
16268 3 Great camera for the price point. But if you plan to use AUTO mode instead of MANUAL, you will NOT be able to record to 2 SD cards simultaneously. If you like dual slot recording, so you ll always have a backup, it only works in Manual mode. 
16269 4 good product 
16270 4 as described. Thanks! 
16271 3 All perfect 
16272 4 Nice quality product. Delivered on time. 
16273 2 My pen came in and the camera was sunk down inside the barrel of the pen... I was able to align it.. For what it is, it works pretty good 
16274 4 Packing spares! 
16275 4 Exacly what i needed 
16276 4 Eliminates the sun problems you have with the gopro. 
16277 4 This thing is solid! Make sure to push the mount firmly against your surface then engage the lever to suck in the cup. Really good mount. I feel no worries putting my gopro on it. 
16278 4 Nice product for the price. Pictures look clear, sharp image. Easy to use. 
16279 4 i love this camera, excelent product 
16280 3 I use it for snowboarding. no problem. 
16281 4 Perfect for the job 
16282 3 not bad for the price 
16283 4 Great product. Fit perfectly with slik 6600. Received when expected. 
16284 3 Is a excelent len for a good price. 
16285 4 It s a good deal! The price is very reasonable. Both the battery and charger work great. I used the battery for over 5 hours in my Sony camcorder. The charger is so convenient for traveling which included a European adapter plug and a car charger. 
16286 2 software is weak camera better 
16287 4 Hopefully people can see my music is tethered to my brain. - John Mayer 
16288 4 Great item, burt I haven t used it since I struggled with how to get it going and no instructions came with it. Still I am happy I purchased it, just need some digital assistance. 
16289 4 Great value! 
16290 0 The ad said it fits Canon Cameras, I wanted it for my X, does not fit, wasted my money 
16291 4 Perfect piece feels very well made 
16292 4 Works as needed 
16293 3 Good quality product. A little heavy but offers a lot of protection. 
16294 3 Goog size. And seems robust. 
16295 1 Did not consistently work. Tried using the expensive Energizer batteries that would last longer, and the camera wouldn t turn on. Goes through normal batteries exceptionally fast. Pictures were acceptable, but with it not working much of the time, my son (to whom we gifted this item) was constantly disappointed/frustrated. 
16296 4 I love the camera. Easy to use, Arrived very fast. Faster than expected. The camera itself is a very pretty red. I love all the items that came with it as well. 
16297 4 perfect for the camera I have! well worth the price. 
16298 4 Very happy, Use in Hot Tub, & At night lights up water really well. 
16299 4 The remote worked well. It came on time. 
16300 4 Excellent 
16301 2 pictures are not very sharp 
16302 4 Cute DSLR for entry level users. Small and light enough to carry with you for traveling and sight-seeing purpose. 
16303 4 Very nice camera especially for the money I paid. Took about 5 minutes to set up. Easy to use with the app on my phone. Color, tilt, pan all work very well. Can check house when away, see if kids are home etc 
16304 4 but wow i got it like 2 years ago and iam still using it untill now !! 
16305 4 works nicely 
16306 4 They are great. 
16307 0 The cable I received was not RG59. The video wire was as thin as the power wire. There were no writing on the cable as illustrated. It would not have handed the elements. I Returned it and amazon gave me a refund. 
16308 4 Hard to use underwater but sit gave a better idea of what was really in your lens view verse guessing! Can t give info on battery life over yet but maybe down the road. Glad I have it as I do not like using my cellphone as a screen. 
16309 3 Great bang for buck 
16310 3 i got a deal on it to give my honest opinion. very cute one!! fo my daughter s BD gift! her dream camera! 
16311 3 Was absolutely wonderful for our trip to Europe. I wish the back pack itself was waterproof and didn t need a cover. That would have a earned the back pack five stars. 
16312 4 Very nice. Just what I needed. 
16313 0 Box was opened and look used. was missing the instruction manual. A 356 page book on how to use this very complicated piece of technology. Not happy.. not sure of the authenticity of the product. Zero stars If that was available. 
16314 4 Great spares for my Geek Pro. Hold a charge just fine. Perfect to have for vacations and long trips. Love it 
16315 4 This camera is awesome! The close-up picture are crisp and clear. An excellent purchase in my book! 
16316 3 functions well 
16317 4 Excellent value for the price. Easy to set up and use with iPad. The most helpful reviews were correct. 
16318 4 good product 
16319 4 great speedlight! 
16320 2 The album is exactly what I was looking for but the rings don t line up properly. 
16321 4 Thin and quick charger for Fuji batteries! 
16322 4 This kit has been just what I needed to make my Nikon work better than imagined. 
16323 0 Initially very impressed with how sturdy bracket is. After two months of use, the bracket remains unchanged and is still very sturdy. However, the mounting screw snapped off. I wished it was made with a more robust material. 
16324 4 I was extremely please with these lens bags. Thick neoprene fabric yet flexible enough to give when I put them in my camera backpack. Best inexpensive investment for my lens. The assorted sizes are perfect!!! 
16325 4 Great camera! Pictures turn out great! 
16326 1 The small tripod will not hold my Nikon D7100 upright. The other tripods are fine. Just the small one is bad. 
16327 4 works perfectly 
16328 0 The thing broke on the first day. Piece of trash. You get what you pay for. 
16329 4 Nice addition to a blackrapid camera strap to hold memory cards, batteries, etc. 
16330 4 Excellent 
16331 4 it works great , nice and clear transfer 
16332 2 I was actually surprised how easy the Nikon D3200 was to use. I was always worried that I wouldn t be able to take good pictures without a lot of studying the manual and a lot of time playing with the camera. 
16333 4 love it just what I need 
16334 4 Thank You for the fast service. The bag fits the camera and the price was great! 
16335 4 Great ball head! A wonderful addition to my gear. 
16336 0 The worst DVR and camera system I ever used, and I have installed hundreds. 
16337 4 Real nice 
16338 4 Great camara. 
16339 4 Everything you need all in one happy little box!! 
16340 4 Works great. I can use my old manual focus Nikon lenses on my Sony A7 now. I did add some shims to get infinity focus exactly right, but then I m picky about that sort of thing. Most photographers wouldn t even notice that. 
16341 0 So irritated! I bought this flash and had it shipped quickly to use for a wedding for my second shooter and it did not work. The battery would not charge and decided to swell up. Not worth $100. 
16342 4 very good charger ! 
16343 4 works good 
16344 4 Great kit you will get almost everything you will need. Great price 
16345 4 This set of camera is valuable, I love it :) 
16346 1 Just cheap. Brand new item but buttons almost broken. Not worth the price. I should ve gotten a Kidde or First Alert at a similar price. My mistake. 
16347 4 Its wire for a specific function. What more can I say? 
16348 4 They are great!! 
16349 1 never could get it to work properly. could be due to weak wifi signal 
16350 4 Bought as an additional battery. Thumbs up. 
16351 4 Very compact and nice 
16352 0 Didn t work 
16353 4 Perfect 
16354 2 This type of shoe mount is OK. I like the Frio better. 
16355 4 love this lense , its alittle heavy but does a great job 
16356 4 One of first Smatree accessories I purchased and have been impressed since day one. Everything is super solid, no play or slack. Feels great, easy to extend and retract. 
16357 0 This IS NOT the Hoya HMC haze UV(0) filter even though the title says so and so does the picture. The description clearly says it s the newer and not as good UV(C) version. Beware since Amazon seems unwilling to change the title or the image. 
16358 4 Handy to have for those &#34;necessary&#34; pictures a vacation needs. 
16359 4 Great inexpensive product. I used them to bypass my alarm window sensors and they worked perfectly. 
16360 4 So far so good! My son is a fan. This camera was easy to use right out of the box! Great price great video and great pictures! 
16361 4 Great product and so much fun for our grandson riding on his bike taking videos... he loves it! 
16362 4 Excellent screen protector, fits perfectly, easy to install, seems almost impossible to scratch. 
16363 4 I have to say.... for the money ... you can t beat this. I can take pictures sharp as a tack with great effect. Don t be afraid of a manual lens. Lots of fun! 
16364 3 Quick shipping and works as expected. One down side, gets dirty quickly and may leave smears. 
16365 1 The item does not fit the flash head of Metz 52 AF-1 Digital flash as it is supposed to. It is certainly not a snug fit. Maybe I should have gone for a Stofen unit (which incidentally was unavailable on Amazon). 
16366 3 Held about 1.5-2 hr on non stop recording at 4K 
16367 4 Everything I expected Thank you 👍 
16368 4 great product 
16369 4 Arrived quickly. The fish eye has some vignetting, but the close up and wide are great. 
16370 4 This battery has given me no problems at all! It is my backup for my nikon d5300! 
16371 2 Could be better...... Some of the pictures are blurry..... but overall great camera for regular pcitures 
16372 4 Really solid, easy to adjust, stands on its own - greatly reduces tripod need, speeds up a shoot for sure 
16373 4 Incredible service and great product. This is well built and the service was excellent. I will be purchasing more items in the future from Digital Goja for sure. Using the product on my Nikon right now and love it. 
16374 4 This is great for taking pictures of my food products. Easy to set up, take down, and takes up very little space in storage. 
16375 3 It came on time & my daughter loves it :) 
16376 4 Just what I needed. Great quality, fits perfectly on screen. 
16377 4 Everyone that see it wants to know where I bought it. I love it 
16378 4 The charger is inexpensive, well built, easy to use and is very convenient for charging the Olympus battery. Highly recommended. Also, Kastar customer service is excellent. 
16379 4 I lost my lens cap. This one works. There isn t much to say. 
16380 3 Haven t had a chance to use but better than paying for batteries. Uninterrupted power supply. 
16381 4 Nice product! 
16382 4 Awesome camera just what I expected. Everything in the kit is high quality well except for the tripod. Great extra batterie also. 
16383 4 Great video quality! More bang for your buck!! 
16384 4 Great drone for the price. I got it in a week. 
16385 0 Disappointed that the battery does not fit the charger very well unless you manuever it in such a way that contact is made. It should a snug fit. 
16386 0 I couldn´t use the selfie stick. It is not compatible with gopro cameras. 
16387 4 Product exactly as advertised and works as it should. 
16388 4 Extremely effective, these clean much faster than others that I ve used. Love the little reusable pouches and the screen buddy is a nice touch. 
16389 2 My Sony wouldn t screw on tight, it was loose. Other than that it was a great mini tripod to use to capture pictures of the whole family on a timer. I also tried to screw on an attachment to hold a cell phone but that fit loose as well. 
16390 4 NICE PRODUCT 
16391 3 Story evolves learning more about the character of each in every episode. 
16392 4 As advertised 
16393 3 Easy to setup, easy to use, highly recommend this product 
16394 4 For a pocket size camera, I am simply amazed. I can t get enough of it on my days off. Definitely wish I had gotten it earlier. 
16395 4 Used it this weekend in Paris. Amazing photo and video quality. I highly recommend this camera for traveling with friends. 
16396 3 I LIKE THE PRICE AND THE QUALITY 
16397 4 love my new receiver 
16398 4 Great camera, worth the money 
16399 4 as advertised 
16400 4 is a must if you have a celestron telescope, well worth it 
16401 4 Vincent did a great job taking care of our problem! 
16402 0 Product arrived without extendable pole which was one of the main items. Plastic is also very weak. Was very disappointed as I had no time to return product before using it on vacation 
16403 4 They are just what we needed 
16404 4 Its easy to use and it lasts a long time. 
16405 4 Henry was very helpful in assisting me in setting up the R2 camera on my PC and my iPhone. The R2 camera is very clear when viewing and it is physically smaller than what I had expected. The small size will be easier to conceal for surveillance. 
16406 4 nice lens - funny bokeh, sharp center ... definietly not sharp sides ;) ideal for having fun :) 
16407 4 Already shot 2 weddings and am very happy. Huge improvement over the SB-800. 
16408 0 Item arrived open inside shipping box and power supply did not work. I returned product. 
16409 1 Don t have proper lens to utilize it think first before buying one 
16410 4 The savings of buying in bulk really helps the pocketbook. 
16411 4 I m glad I bought this tripod/ mono pod. It is so handy, very light and easy to use. I always bring it with me whenever I bring my camera. 
16412 4 Great! 
16413 3 Good buy 
16414 3 I have not had the occasion to use it. But it appeared to be a good investment. 
16415 4 Very pleased 
16416 4 Amazing value! 
16417 4 A great alternative to Home Secretary 
16418 4 Great purchase! 
16419 0 Product delivered...but only lasts 20 min. really cheap product 
16420 2 Everything came as expected, but, head strap is missing bolt to screw GoPro into, therefore, I was unable to use it snorkeling over the weekend... Chest cam worked great, and selfie stick was nice. Other than the flaw in the head strap, I like what I got. 
16421 4 It fits great on camera. Rubber grip is similar to the camera, very good materials 
16422 0 Didn t fit my Olympus camerea 
16423 3 Very Good 
16424 2 I really like the product, but when it detects motion it says so where the clocks suppose to be, so if the person the camera detects sees the motion detected (clock) they ll know their being recorded 
16425 2 Camera takes good pictures but has a slow response. This is the only downside to this camera. 
16426 4 I LOVE IT! 
16427 4 Works great on my Nikon D7200 just as the review stated. All functions work and both batteries are displayed on the menu 
16428 3 Just took it on a European vacation. The straps up front don t close easily it besides this it s solid, inconspicuous camera bag and it looks great 
16429 4 [[ASIN:B00004WCGF Canon Deluxe Gadget Bag 100EG]] A little bit smaller than I had hoped but I managed to get everything snugged in. All in all a quality case and definitely up to the task of protecting my camera. 
16430 4 I really like this spotting scope for its compact size and clarity. I m having a custom soft case made for it. Pentax would enhance its sales if they were to produce and distribute it with a soft case. 
16431 3 This unit was purchased to replace a Canon ZR80 that burnt out. Suprisingly the ZR80 had slightly better picture quality than this one. Where this camera excels is it s easy to use features and menus. 
16432 3 Just as described. Works great. With screen was touch screen. Other than that, it works as good as my old one. 
16433 2 I can t really say that this modifier made a pointedly noticeable change but every little bit helps and My flash DOES seem a tad more controlled when on camera. 
16434 0 the battery does not work, it goes out in a minute of use. where I can buy a new battery. 
16435 3 Had all the bells and whistles plus more. 
16436 4 Fits as the original. Buy several as they come off easily. 
16437 3 Double zipper tabs would be nice, but overall it s hard to beat the price/value. Beefy strap and good weather resistance too. 
16438 4 Camera is working great Customer service agent Walter - was very helpful to get it set-up 
16439 4 Good 
16440 3 Fantastic product at a very reasonable price, i simply love it 
16441 4 Great camera at a good price. The variable zoom is perfect for pointing down my drive way. The camera arrived quickly with everything intact and working. 
16442 3 Works Good. 
16443 4 good charger 
16444 4 Love it 
16445 4 Thanks! 
16446 4 This thing works and is ideal. 
16447 0 leaked and cost me my go-pro, yes should have done a dry run, seamed durable and I was just snorkeling so figured this was my test before an actual dive. like the more durable clasp compared to the original housing. complete crap DO NOT BUY! 
16448 4 Battery fits well and works fine 
16449 4 This was the best a Big Bang for my buck!! I use everything here!! Can t wait to order more!! 
16450 1 I don t use mine very often and am disappointed that one of the straps had torn off already. Disappointing 
16451 4 We bought these at a reasonable price. They don t last as long as the name brand but are a great bargain anyway. 
16452 4 Good quality lens cloths. 
16453 0 Camera is excellent, software is terrible and very cumbersome. 
16454 2 Good Deal! 
16455 4 Bought this for my 15 year old son. It has a ton of gadgets in it. He loves it! 
16456 4 This was a Christmas present. 
16457 4 I used this camera on a trip out West to Yellowstone NP and most of the pictures taken were excellent. 
16458 4 This mount holds very tightly and I am glad that I bought it. I have this mount as well as the GoPro one and the BRLS is a lot sturdier than the GoPro suction mount. 
16459 1 its cumbersome to take the camera out. I replaced this item with an other product. 
16460 4 Good zoom 
16461 4 This is the best.... I just the pictures!!! I don t leave home with out it. 
16462 4 Granddaughter is thrilled, camera works great! 
16463 4 Works perfectly as a replacement for the OEM battery at 1/3 the cost. 
16464 4 Works beautifully and I got it for a good price! 
16465 3 Works well. Cannot find charger. 
16466 4 They are good batteries, work great. 
16467 4 Ordered this for our office to take passport pictures for students. This is easy to use. And will be an asset to the office. 
16468 4 Item as described and works well. Arrived on time. 
16469 1 Didn t fit my speed rings. 
16470 4 bought too many! wanna buy one from me? 
16471 4 Essential for your grab bag 
16472 4 Fits my 70D perfectly and worked awesome. The color is not far off from my 70d so it really looks like the more expensive models 
16473 2 Great backpack. Only gave it three starts because its not as handy as a messenger bag style when it comes to switching lenses on the move. 
16474 4 Excellent!! 
16475 4 Arrived just as expected! Looking forward to integrating these into our September wedding as an interactive medium for guests. Thank you for the prompt shipping! 
16476 3 Batteries fit perfectly into charger and camera. They don t hold a charge for as long as the original batteries, but they are great as back ups. 
16477 4 Very good. 
16478 4 Such an amazing combo for a great price. Not one regret about this purchase! 
16479 4 great 
16480 4 Works GREAT! 
16481 2 thank you.. 
16482 4 perfect 
16483 4 Fast shipping, pleased with purchase. 
16484 3 Easy installment.. could use a touch of threadlocker. 
16485 4 Meets my needs and very sterdy 
16486 4 This battery is just as good as the original Canon types. Three years an still no issues. If you need this battery, stop now and just buy it all ready. 
16487 1 Very disappointing interior material s quality. 
16488 0 Doesn t come close to doing what it s supposed to plus there s no directions. Very shotty 
16489 4 Works great for the price, effortless setup. The mobile app is nice and it provides just what you need. My only regret is that I did not get the 8 channel DVR. 
16490 4 Go pro?! WHY?!!!! This does the same thing, and is AWESOME! I use it on my drone, and it can take a BEATING so far! The waterproof case makes this a GREAT purchase! GET IT! 
16491 1 Hood doesn t screw on well. 
16492 3 Had to return the first unit due to not functioning second unit received a working perfectly fine 
16493 4 Works great--is exactly what i wanted. 
16494 4 Nice bag 
16495 4 Calvin did a great job hooking up my camera to the cloud Foscam lets me keep an eye on my property 
16496 4 Very good quality for the price, don t forget to buy a micro SD card to go with it, though! 
16497 4 This thing is really impressive, built like a tank. Holds over 200 lbs - i can believe it. I got it to hold a video slider super low and it will do that all day. Over bulty but light and packable. Great niche product 
16498 4 Just Great! 
16499 4 Great product, very nice quality and works as it should 
16500 4 Who does not love extra batteries! 
16501 0 This battery is marked as 1300mAh, not 1600mAh as described. 
16502 4 fits everything perfectly 
16503 4 As advertised 
16504 4 The kids had a blast playing with this waterproof camera on our recent vacations. It s definitely critical that you buy a &#34;floater&#34; so you don t lose it to the depths of the pool or ocean. 
16505 4 Is a great price for this camera 
16506 1 When playing &#34;random&#34; photos and with the motion detection &#34;on&#34; the screen freezes black after some time... But when the unit plays photos sequentially there is no problem with the motion detection. Not very happy and not likely to suggest this product to anyone else. 
16507 4 Good product and a fantastic seller A++++++ 
16508 4 perfect 
16509 3 Product was as described, and arrived on time. 
16510 2 Workscas advertised. My issue though is the thing to tighten the flash could be sturdier. 
16511 1 And turns everything blue. I live in LA and wouldn t purchase again 
16512 4 Very good 
16513 0 Is not a great camera. I have had issues with my pics being blurry. I wish I had sprung for a better camera now Im stuck with this one for awhile. 
16514 4 Product is excellent and fast shipping!!! Thanks 
16515 3 Not the most stable tri pod 
16516 3 This looks and operates like a GoPro3 for a lot less money. nice accessories. Be sure and purchase no more than a 32GB micro memory card. The documentation is a bit weak, but there are a lot of videos online to walk you through the operation of this 1080P camera. 
16517 4 Very good. 
16518 4 i am ashamed to say i love this product. you might have trouble getting it to take pictures if you have an older phone, but you can download an app. 
16519 4 Thanks so much. Fast shipping and great product :) 
16520 4 Great Seller Super! 
16521 4 Perfect 
16522 4 product is as described, well machined, works perfectly. either by hand or a coin. 
16523 3 Thank you, very happy with the management of purchase - sale. 
16524 2 I found that the optical quality was poor. See attached sample. I bought this for moving water photos so maybe it won t matter in &#34;real world&#34; imaging, but I m disappointed. 
16525 4 Loved it 
16526 2 Smaller than expected but I guess good for the price 
16527 3 Takes awhile to get used to taking photos without a viewfinder or screen. Picture quality is quite good, I was particularly impressed with underwater shots. 
16528 4 i love this camera i ts one of the best. you can basically do anything that you can do on an Android cell phone including making and receiving calls with your google account, facebook messenger, oovoo, skype. i just wish it had a sim card slot 
16529 4 It s really light and fits so much gear! Genius design! 
16530 4 Got it 
16531 4 Awesome product very pleased 
16532 2 Extra to my needs at this time. 
16533 3 love the zoom. Have not been able to get the wifi to work yet, so hopefully it will. overall, takes great photos. 
16534 4 This thing is very well made and highly recommended 
16535 4 Great value. Well delivered. Thank you 
16536 1 Easy to use and mount.. But this is not what i expected... 
16537 4 great light,can carry it around in your pocket! great product. 
16538 4 Great little camera. 
16539 0 They don t fit Sony RX-10, contrary to what you read! I should have paid attention to some of the other reviewers who commented on inaccurate sizing. Both batteries I purchased stick and I had to use needle-nose pliers to remove them! Bummer! 
16540 4 Very nice protection for the lenses. Very usefull. 
16541 4 very good product, peace of mind for your much more expensive lens. (drop test: my daughter played around with the filter and accidentally unscrewed it from the lens and it dropped 1 m down to the hard concrete floor, and it did not break, nor scratch. Maybe I was lucky). 
16542 3 takes nice pictures and i easy to use 
16543 4 Fits my 430 EX perfectly! 
16544 4 Youtube channel: http://youtube.com/teainthetreesbp I get constant messages about the quality of my videos. EVERYTHING is filmed on that channel with this camera. I will probably buy the next one when it comes out. Best hd camera I ve owned. 
16545 4 Nice protection. 
16546 4 I got this one to replace an older one that was going on five years old and finally quit. It s capable of zoned operation in its sensing area to fine tune the field it monitors, and can be adjusted to only work at night. A nice little unit. 
16547 4 Great product 
16548 0 Nice idea but not use friendly. Hard to tel which mode it is in. 
16549 4 Awesome external flash! 
16550 2 The problem I had with this is that it was very easy to dislodge. A couple of times I did not notice that it had fallen off. Apart from that worked well. 
16551 1 Broken clasp as soon as I opened it. It also has a film glued to the back door. Wish I would have bought the real deal. 
16552 0 I purchased this for my father with many grand kids out of town. Although it seemed like a nice product, the software, especially the remote are terrible. This is NOT a good product for non-tech savvy individuals. I would avoid. 
16553 0 Although I had no problems connecting it to wifi, just could not get it to record to SD. 
16554 4 works great 
16555 4 I have replaced larger (too large) straps on my Olympus E-M1 and E-M5 with the Leash Camera Straps from Peak Design. I like the concept, size and weight and they are easily adjusted to a different length. Just perfect for the mirrorless cameras. 
16556 4 Pretty simple mount and work perfect 
16557 4 This is a fantastic lens at an affordable price. I have been having so much fun photographing everything from grandchildren to wildlife to butterflies! Easy to handle without using tripod. 
16558 4 Delivered as stated, packaging was great and batteries charged and work in my camera. 
16559 4 Great unit charges two batteries at the same time unlike other chargers. Speedy delivery! 
16560 4 I was totally amazed of how small and easy to handle, is the FotoTech ML-L3 Wireless Shutter Release Remote, I could not have been any happier. I had other type of remote before and this is absolutely the best, my congratulations to FotoTech. 
16561 4 Package came exactly as ordered. I needed the batteries and charger more than the cleaning supplies, but it is nice to have a fresh cleaning kit to go with a new camera! I always like to have a spare battery handy. 
16562 1 No. Very Silly. No where near loud enough. 
16563 4 Precisely what I needed to replace my older Lumix (also with Leica lens.) It s my fourth Lumix and as each is replaced I give it to one of my granddaughters. That way I get razor sharp pictures of my family. 
16564 4 This case is pretty nice! I am quite happy with this purchase. 
16565 4 I got this battery charger today and plugged my Nikon J3 battery into it. Worked great. Fast shipping and a third the price of a replacement from Nikon. I m a happy customer. 
16566 4 This case works wonderfully with my DSLR. I have a 55-300mm lens that fits well in this case while attached to my camera. I have brought it along while traveling internationally and it did a great job at protecting my camera. 
16567 4 Works great and a great price for the functions. 
16568 4 Great fun for my wife 
16569 3 GoPro equivalent w/ Camera viewing/controlling & file downloads wirelessly on phone (Droid or iPhone) or tablet through App. App allows you to take pictures remotely, view screen is low quality (circa 2001 digital cameras) but the picture/video quality (3000x4000 option available) is very good! 
16570 3 Excellent stuff. Canon makes good cameras. The bag is actually pretty good as everything from this kit that I will use fits just fine. The mini tripod is pretty much useless for a camera of this size. 
16571 3 awesome 
16572 1 just cant find a way to square them up to my eyes properly - really don t understand it because having owned about 10 different sets of binoculars over the last 40+ years, these ones just don t allow unobstructed vision in any adjustment range. its weird. 
16573 4 This is a great tripod! 
16574 4 Very helpful & handy! 
16575 4 Seems to be working fine. 
16576 4 Must have if you use the Sony RX100III, Affordable. I always have a spare batt in my pocket when I m carrying my Sony. 
16577 3 Cute product. Some stickers didn t stick well but others did. I would buy again with other designs. 
16578 3 The case is made of steel and, although gives protection to the PCB, adds a lot of weight to an FPV system. Better video quality than many others- I still use it on my 250quad 
16579 4 If you just want a case that could keep your GoPro and some basic accessories safe and with a minimal size at the same time, this is it. 
16580 4 Real bargin 
16581 2 Not a bad camera, but the color is way off! It works, connects is easy to use but the picture quality is very low and it does not display colors correctly. 
16582 1 It not the type of charger that will charge your battery? It took long time to get my camcorder charged enough to work right? I would like to find an original one for my camcorder instead. 
16583 4 This is a fun thing to have, but it is very hard to find anywhere to buy the film. 
16584 4 Excellent versatility. Out of the few I have seen this seems to be the most durable as well. 
16585 4 simple but effective 
16586 0 Only the clock worked. Web camera did not work. Recording camera did not record. It was a very expensive clock, that s all! 
16587 2 One battery wouldn t. They replaced it quickly. No complaints 
16588 4 Buy one! Having so much fun with this. Seems to work with all of my lenses, minus some vignetting on certain ones. 
16589 4 great product 
16590 4 For the price you cannot go worng, It is perfect for persons who travel as it is extremely lightweight. I was a little cautious at first to put my camera on it but it held up my Canon DSLR very nicely. 
16591 4 Excellent 
16592 3 I ve never used a circular polarizer before but this seems to be doing what I need it to do. It fits nicely on my Canon SX60 and has a nice case for storage when it is not in use. I m very happy with this product. 
16593 2 bulky 
16594 4 As opposed to other reviewers, I see no jumps or jerks with this. it just plain works. the 5-minute 360-degree is good for getting quick interior rotations. It is now an essential part of my kit. dead easy to use. 
16595 2 I did not use the stand up tripod but the lens work great. 
16596 4 I love those things and already used them a lot. No complains! 
16597 4 Outstanding Item and fast shipping. 
16598 0 does *not* work for my new d3300 or mh-24 charger -- it just flashes rapidly. nikon website says this means defective battery. 
16599 4 Just what I needed. 
16600 0 This item does not work. I have bought it two seperate times and continue to have the same problem. Will Not Turn on, never even got a chance to test the quality. Very Disappointed. 
16601 4 Item delivered in a timely manner and was just as described on the web site. 
16602 4 Does the job of replacing one I lost while working on a window. No fiddling necessary. 
16603 3 Works like a champ. Good quality. Shipped quickly. 
16604 4 AWESOME! Worked great for fast lens changes while doing street photography! 
16605 4 Love it !!! And the delivery was awesome!!! 
16606 4 Good 
16607 1 The product is not set up easily by the average home owner, and the instructions do not tell you how to connect to your home wireless network, instead directing you to the company s cloud service. Only one smart phone can be connected--a product limitation. 
16608 4 Lens caps fit perfectly on my T3i and seem like they are an even better fit than the Cannon cover that came with the lens. 
16609 4 My wife loves it, enough said 
16610 1 Disappointing Night view not as expected No better than the 700TVL and 450TVL cameras that I have already 
16611 3 Does the job, but inserting a battery is tricky, I have to juggle it and make may attempts before the battery will go in. Something is not quite correct with the physical interface between the charger and the battery. 
16612 0 The lenses are loose and the glass actually rattles around. I am going to return them and order something better. 
16613 4 Worked like new right out of the box as it should. Still using it a year later and i m still very happy with my purchase. 
16614 4 Everything fits good, works good. No complaints here. 
16615 1 Didn t work for my Canon SX280 which has a known battery flaw, nice package otherwise though from other reviews the fast charger may cause problems. 
16616 4 I love this Camera..... 
16617 4 Nice backdrop. 
16618 4 Great product, 
16619 0 After installing this product, your nice bright camera screen becomes a blurry &#34;frosted glass&#34; hardly usable mess. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I put it on a brand new Nikon Coolpix AW130 and removed it promptly. Its like looking thru steamed up glasses. I returned it to Amazon for refund. 
16620 0 Don t use the wrist mount I lost my hero 4 at the lake in the water the top of the part of the mount that spins broke off warning not use it 
16621 4 so thankful I found these 
16622 3 This drone is a bit difficult to control and camera quality isn t great so I mounted a gopro and got amazing footage. This thing goes out of control in soft winds!!! 
16623 4 This remote works wonderfully with my DSLR. It s very handy to have for photos taken with a tripod- much more convenient than self timer. 
16624 3 I don t know if the Energizer name is the same as the battery manufacturer but the price and multi-type card use capability caught my interest for the task ahead of me. 
16625 0 The audio/sound is bad. The capability to hear whats going on thru the app is very static. The microphone capabilty to talk thru the app to the device doesnt work at all. 
16626 4 Fits my Nikon D600 perfectly. 
16627 3 Works well. I ve purchased 3 so far. 
16628 4 Nice to be able to still get this film. Worked fine. 
16629 4 Excellent quality at a very reasonable price. 
16630 3 Good buy 
16631 4 Great trigger. 
16632 4 Ok 
16633 3 Good replacement parts. Both charged up very well. 
16634 4 Even when you are in others place,you also can keep closer to your house,your loved people any time by your phone or PC. 
16635 4 kenneth was very very helpful. He was very knowledgable about the foscam products and got me up and running in no time. 
16636 3 It worked great. My battery was charged in no time 
16637 4 Item arrived on time and works well. I have used it for sports photography and like it much better than the neck strap. 
16638 2 its ok 
16639 4 Great product, exactly what I was looking for! Excellent customer service. Highly recommend this case as a travel case for your GoPro... 
16640 3 Fix perfect to my AZ1. 
16641 4 This was bought as a backup in case my battery ran down and I had no place to recharge my camera. 
16642 1 they are very weak 
16643 4 Does the job....thanks!!! 
16644 4 Amazing camera and the best customer service I have seen in a very long time! 
16645 4 IDEAL! 
16646 4 Light weight, but solid. Exactly what I needed to attach my video light to my c-stand for a halo light. 
16647 4 love it 
16648 3 I love the feel of this little camera in my hands! Be careful with charging it though! Easy carry and fits in a small purse. 
16649 0 It is a garbage, can not be used. 
16650 0 Bought two of these, but neither works with the Foscam 9805w. The cables seem to fit, but not delivering any electricity. 
16651 4 Awesome product. Exactly like the original Gopro 
16652 4 Perfect for our SLR, very sleek and compact to do day trips with. Rain fly is clutch. There is no room for any other gear you want to carry, except for very small essential accessories like a battery, a lens cap, or things equally flat and small. 
16653 4 AWESOME!!!! 
16654 2 EXCELLENT, No complaints 
16655 4 Easy to use and everything you need 
16656 4 Perfect size. High quality photos. Love it! 
16657 3 I would have given it 5 stars -- delivered fast, packaged well -- but time will tell how they last. But so far, so good! 
16658 4 Just as I expected. 
16659 4 Excelente 
16660 1 Not worth buying! Came very wrinkled and you can not iron it. 
16661 4 Nice slim, filter. 
16662 4 Alsome works with vision 2 
16663 4 Super fast shipping! Great product! 
16664 4 INCREDIBLE. HUGE. GREAT VALUE-- high quality--- these have taken my portraits to another level. 
16665 4 Built-in Z-Wave Plus! Can t get better than that. 
16666 4 Great for the price. Real sturdy. 
16667 3 Sturdy Construction. Good resultas as of today. 
16668 4 Great product 
16669 4 I love using this! It is the best product! 
16670 0 Do not buy if you re going to be cliff-jumping or any sports or similar nature 
16671 4 Works like a Nikon lc-52 snap front lens cap should😏 
16672 4 Works great!!! 
16673 4 Arrived quickly- works great with my Nikon D3200 and I love that it also comes with the car adapter to charge on the go! 
16674 4 A++++ super deal! super fast delivery WOW 2 days from the order to being at my door! 
16675 4 Solid fast good product. 
16676 4 Accurate, fast, quality construction. 
16677 4 very good. thanks. 
16678 4 Fantastic camera, better than I hoped for!! 
16679 4 Didn t need all of them, but down the road am sure I will use them 
16680 4 Everything was as promised. Thanks! 
16681 4 Good and economical at less than $15 
16682 3 These are great! Totally real looking, I trembled when I got them the package. I left my own house, before I called the police. They are big chunky and totally sell the gag. 
16683 2 Before buying good filters I wanted to try this package to see how I would like using filters. This package gave me some good options to learn and work with filters. If anything the adopter ring alone were worth the price. 
16684 4 great 
16685 4 Great lens and excellent price! Timely delivery. Included one year international warranty. I registered the lens online. The lens delivers sharp pictures, typical Nikon quality. 
16686 4 Great 
16687 4 great cd on how to use the camera 
16688 4 SOOOO much fun and easy to use. Have not tried to add my camera yet. 
16689 4 I love the ability to change the color with the gels. For video work, I use the blue for daylight color temperature. 
16690 4 so far so good, and it it arrived in a most timely manner. many thanks. 
16691 2 having trouble with the auto focus...servos will not operate. anxious about warranty 
16692 4 This is a great lens for the price. No need to go into great detail because if your a beginner like me it just goes over your head. However you can trust at this price point the lens will not disappoint! Get it. Great Value good quality. 
16693 0 It took the same quality pictures as before. 
16694 4 Patrick at Foscam support did a wonderful job of helping me to install and understand the IP camera. I thank him very much!!This is one of the best outdoor IP cameras made. Can t wait to get it mounted!! Thanks!! 
16695 4 Always got to have a spare! 
16696 0 horrible product. Felt very cheaply made and has little to no projection of light. It barely iluminates the corner of a 5x5 room. 
16697 4 Looks like a real camera and the red link blinks brightly at night 
16698 3 Works well on my non Nikon Flash 
16699 0 I am very disappointed with camera and am returning it I am not able to access it all day but. Half of the time when I try, it gives me &#34;Connect Timeout&#34;. It s a disappointment. 
16700 4 Unbelievably great price and exactly what I was hoping for. I will be grabbing a second one for travel, so I can do two at once. With the X100T a notoriously awful battery performance, at least it s cheap to buy extra power. 
16701 4 I haven t had much chance to use this item, but I m glad I purchased it at a wonderful price. I love the red color and it will be used quite a bit during my next trip. 
16702 4 Exactly what i wanted, exactly what i thought it was and what i needed it to do. Great product and great transaction. 
16703 4 GOOD PRICE 
16704 4 Works great, fast shipping, reasonable price. 
16705 4 I lost exactly the same camera and bought this as a replacement. I love it. 
16706 0 Waist of money 
16707 4 Battery s last just as long as official gopro batteries, and so convenient to charge 2 at a time... I have 6 batteries total since the life is so short on the gopro 
16708 4 works great and lasts longer than the gopro battery that came with the camera. 
16709 4 works great never have to charge batteries just plug the camera right into the wall 
16710 4 Works good for the price but the instructions are not not well documented and be sure to get a SD memory card for it. 
16711 0 2 the 4 no good they was used moters 
16712 4 Satisfied with the product. Should have gotten sooner. Just got it. Hope it lasts. 
16713 4 These batteries worked perfect for my Canon Vixia M500. The charger work good and charges fairly quick. Would buy again. 
16714 4 Easy to set up right out of the box. Couldn t be happier with it! 
16715 4 This small battery is perfect! The old one (that we had to use) was rather large and bulky - but it came with the camcorder (gift). Thank you!!! 
16716 4 I think some of the people need stronger fingers or use a tool to tighten the clamp. It works well. I have no problems. 
16717 4 Great product. 
16718 4 Used right after I received the package. Very happy about the purchase. Would recommend to friends. 
16719 4 worked as should thanks 
16720 4 LOVE the Samsung NX3000 and all the lenses I ve purchased for it. A great go-to camera, small in size, that delivers top-quality photos. 
16721 0 Not what is advertised. AT ALL. Trust me, if you re looking for a Sj4000L, this is not it. 
16722 4 fits into a laptop sized bag nicely, very sturdy when fully extended. Overall very happy with the stand. 
16723 0 Sonys mounts are crap.... And half of them are discontinued.... Buy a go pro 
16724 4 Great product, works great and does exactly what it is suppose to do. 
16725 4 Great 
16726 4 Fit perfectly 
16727 4 I need it. It was delivered quickly. So I m happy. 
16728 3 The mounts provided with the camera are somewhat useful in most cases, but difficult to adapt for non-typical applications. Camera works well, and very good quality video. 
16729 0 it is broken and does not work and no one has returned my calls to replace it. and my name is not richard, I am BJ at bjdaneshfar@gmail.com BJD 
16730 4 Fast service and great price. 
16731 3 Great rain/dust cover but unfortunately it is too large for my Nikon D3100. Thank you for the fast shipping!! 
16732 4 Does a good job of lighting up the front door for the security cameras. Cheap but works...I m happy. 
16733 4 Excellent value and amazing performance. My money was well spent! It is still flying well with no damage after 40+ flights of 7 minutes each.. 
16734 4 Ordered 5 p.m. and received 11 a.m. the next day. AMAZING!! The batteries came fully charged and carefully packaged. They fit into the camera perfectly (Casio x-s10). I can t tell you about the charger yet, but the entire purchase was 100% worth it. 
16735 4 I am very happy with this lens. It makes a great addition to my camera kit. Takes nice close-ups of flowers and plants which was my main reason in purchasing it. The filters that were sold with it are also good to have, as well as the cleaning kit. 
16736 0 Everything is blurred when the Magnifier is attached. Looks great when looking through it alone, but once attached, it s useless, unless you want blurred pictures. However, customer service was excellent o deal with. 
16737 4 Works great! 
16738 4 fits 
16739 3 It worked well for it s price. Not the best but not the worst. 
16740 4 Have been taking practice shots and the camera is very easy to use. 
16741 4 thankyou 
16742 4 Great film. 
16743 1 The metal strap was scratched (looked like a used product was sent) and crooked covering a half of the camera window, and as you can see on the picture it shows that is comes with a 16GB card what actually is a lie, there was no card at all 
16744 4 I have not had to use this protection plan but it is always good to have in case you need it. 
16745 4 This was the first flash kit ive ever bought and they work amazing! 
16746 0 The camera produced no signal, or was incompatable with my DVR of same mfr. Return process of defective product was very simple. I will probably order another 
16747 4 Have no tried it in the field yet bit seems sturdy. Using it with a Sony A5000. 
16748 4 I debated a case for the Phantom Pro 3 for about a month and am lucky I didn t damage it; this backpack works well - and keeps the unit secure. A must have to protect your gear. 
16749 0 Just received 2 of these. This item is falsely advertised it does not have 30 constant LED lights ,It has 1 very bright blinking red light. 
16750 4 It does what it s supposed to. Works fine. The tilt seems a little chintzy with the clicking you hear as it passes what I assume are &#34;notches&#34; somewhere, but it s working and tilting just fine. 
16751 4 Works great with my Canon hf g20, I only wish I had another camera so that I can purchase another on!!! 
16752 4 Battery charger works well and was a good price, too. Arrived in good shape on date when promised. 
16753 4 Had no problems with this. Worked like OE battery. I would buy another one. 
16754 0 Camera gets haze after a few months and amazon won t replace it. Not happy 
16755 4 Great product. Worked as expected. Easy enough for a 10 year old to use. So far only used on a video camera and worked without any problem. 
16756 4 gave as part of gift bag for someone with new Go Pro and they loved it! 
16757 4 I ve said it over and over.. you can t go wrong with B&W. I am tough on my gear and B&W is always there when o th her brands fail. Quality glass and top construction. 
16758 0 Was not up to the dimensions advertised and not adequate for my needs. 
16759 4 Works great .easily recharges 
16760 4 Works up to about 60 feet for me. The only negative was that it took about 3 weeks to arrive from Australia. I would order another one. The good part is that it works on a 9v battery. 
16761 1 Eh. Kinda useless. Props still broke in a pretty mild crash. 
16762 4 For the price it works great!!! 
16763 4 works good put around our garden to scare deer out 
16764 4 Butter-smooth shots with my GoPro HERO3. Easy to use, but reco buying the Neewer Feiyu 2PCS Ultra Reach Carbon Fiber poles also for some nice different POV shots. 
16765 4 great seller - delivered as promised! 
16766 0 Very poor!!!! There s no reason to buy this product/item.... 
16767 4 ok. 
16768 4 I purchased this to use my 77mm Hoya ND filter on my 67mm Canon Macro Lens. The construction is solid. I m very picky in regards to what I put on my lenses, and I have no concerns using this adapter. 
16769 4 Wasabi Power is the best aftermarket brand battery maker I have ever owned. They just work. 
16770 1 Problems with quality. Audio is crap.. 
16771 2 It s okay but doesn t add too much difference to your regular lens. 
16772 4 Great value. Cheaper then the stories 
16773 4 Excellent product!!!!! 
16774 3 Great Product 
16775 4 Product arrived quickly as promised and works as advertised. I was able to tuck the clothes into various bags etc so as to have available to use on glasses, iPads etc. 
16776 4 Bought as a gift. For the price, it s an excellent set of binoculars. Little hard to adjust for comfortable viewing, but it s not hard to use. 
16777 3 Good economy spotting scope. 
16778 4 B+W and you don t worry about IQ degradation. 
16779 4 Exception Quality Glass. Doesn t introduce vignetting and is excellent for protecting your lens in harsh conditions. 
16780 4 a good camera. this was a good purchase. 
16781 4 This thing charges well and I have 2 extra batteries. Can t ask for more because shooting in the fly and having a dead battery this will Dave you time. Hasn t failed me now. 
16782 4 sets up really quick and easy. I like the size and resolution. 
16783 4 Very good 
16784 4 Outstanding Item and fast shipping. 
16785 4 it works so no issue with it 
16786 3 Pros: - Protects lens - Inexpensive Cons: - Feels a bit bigger than original Nikon cap; fits very tightly when in place - Doesn t clamp on as quickly as original cap; falls off a couple times before staying on 
16787 3 Works as advertised. Can always use additional protection. 
16788 1 it s okay for the price you pay. getting started the filter does the job, once you know how to use these tools you ll get a better one anyway - the one that covers the spectrum you desire for the scene you re after. 
16789 4 A great inexpensive alternative for the causal or semi-professional photographer. The battery continues to run well with moderate use. 
16790 4 a good back up camera if your SLR or smartphone dies on you while you re in the middle of recording. 
16791 4 These reflectors are exactly what I was looking for... I love that they are compact for travel and store easily. 
16792 4 My experience with this product has been excellent. It was delivered on time and was exactly what I expected based on the description on the Amazon website. 
16793 4 Just what I needed before taking a trip. The camera is about 6 years old. I ve been using the original battery since then. 
16794 4 Great item 
16795 4 This is great. Cheap price and good quality. 
16796 3 very easy to mount and setup. has good depth and wide angle. very clear picture both day and night. 
16797 4 great reflector - great price - no problems with it yet! 
16798 4 This is an excellent product. Shott Glass screen protectors cost a fortune. This is a well made, and good looking, alternative that is very cost effective. I ended up buying a second for another camera. 
16799 4 Great Product 
16800 4 Has a lot of features for the price, easy to operate, I think it is a lot better than my K-7 that cost more. 
16801 4 This is one &#34;great buy&#34;. for the money. Its an easy install with great built in features and the picture quality is excellent. I would highly recommend this product for all tech enthusiasts as well as parents with newborns for monitoring. 
16802 2 doesnt last long 
16803 4 Excellent 
16804 4 If you don t have this lens yet, what are you waiting for. Its a compact lens that has amazing clarity, and with a f/1.8 you cant beat that with a stick. It has the same quality feel an look you would expect from a Canon product. 
16805 4 product good 
16806 4 The camera is easy to use and carry in your pocket. I had it my pool and it worked fine. I m happy I made the choice and got it. 
16807 4 Very comfortable and floatable. Great product and great price. 
16808 4 Item worked exactly as intended, It enabled me to take photos and video of my snorkeling adventure in the Virgin Islands without worrying that I d lose my camera! 
16809 3 Perfect for my purpose 
16810 4 they work great 
16811 4 Recommend! Quickly detects someone in its view and alerts. Bought 3 of them! Great for anywhere around your home, set tones differently and quickly isolate the area you need to check. 
16812 4 Does exactly what it s meant to at a great price. Solid build and mounts firmly. Using with a 57mm 1.4 an no issues with aperture when on the mount. 
16813 4 Perfect 
16814 3 great value 
16815 4 Worked Perfectly for my Sony DSCHX90V/B Digital Camera 
16816 4 I had some issues trying to set up my foscam, and thanks to Danny all the installation went smooth. Great customer service thank you. The camera is looking sharp and I love the HD resolution. 
16817 4 quick service, product as advertised 
16818 4 Very good stuff 
16819 3 Remove the internal spacer and the fz70 snuggly fits in the case. Seems to be well padded and decent quality. 
16820 2 These are ok. I thought they would add it little more to photos, but I think they are really more just for photo gimic. 
16821 4 So easy to use! 
16822 2 The telescope itself works well after about 20 minutes of getting used to its adjustments the tripod however is flimsy trash. I believe 3 Lincoln logs would be sturdier. So before you buy just make sure you add a tripod to your order 
16823 4 Worked as expected. 
16824 3 This protective is very good. 
16825 4 Nice 
16826 4 Brought it as a gift and they love it 
16827 4 I bought this to wear a go pro while skiing with our group. Its a great way to wear under my jacket and have a hands free platform to capture our fun. Its well made and has plenty of adjustments to accommodate many situations. 
16828 4 This is great upgrade for any basic telescope. 
16829 4 It was simple to set up, the picture is excellent, and we ve especially appreciated having it during a crazy wildfire season. It gives us peace to be able to see our serene living room from a distance. 
16830 3 Smooth transaction. Fast shipping. A+++. Thanks you!!! 
16831 4 Its solidly build all metal mount. I bought it to mount it on orion 15x70 and managed to do it and took really good pics of moon at night using this. 
16832 4 very happy with this easy to use- love the zoom - used a friends camera when we went on a cruise to Alaska took great pics- so I decided to purchase one for my next cruise- the package deal was a great find too! 
16833 3 Great solid tripod, better than expected for the price! 
16834 4 You can feel the difference by the packaging, but it won t stop there. The engineering and glass are really superior. It s worth it to have something of this quality on lenses you love and work so hard with. 
16835 1 The battery cuts out all the time. It says the battery is low then says it is full. 
16836 4 This camera works great. 
16837 4 BW the way to go 
16838 4 Very good 
16839 4 I love my new tripod, I didn t realize it would hold a camera and my phone! So affordable and it weighs close to nothing. Can t wait to take this bad boy on vacation. 
16840 3 I like it, its great for the price. It can be a little unstable when you a light and a sandbag on it raised high, its just smaller diameter metal poles. works great for a beginners boom stand though, would recommend 
16841 3 Hard to download 
16842 4 I have set them up to email me and also to ftp on my nas and it all works as it should be. 
16843 3 Works well but have had some issues using with Canon Rebel. It caused some issues with screen. Had to call Canon. Bottom line, must shut down camera totally before taking battery out. 
16844 4 The camera was as easy as the thermostat and smoke detector to set up. We had no issues. I would like ability to pan and tilt the camera remotely. 
16845 4 Works as intended! Great price too. 
16846 4 everything i expected it to be, took awhile to learn all of the settings but it is very beginner friendly. ISO above 400 or 800 gets grainy fast. 
16847 3 Works pretty well. However Feiyu support doesn t answer all questions. For example, why you can t trim the forward position even though you can trim the other axis. 
16848 4 Great Camera. I use of it for work and research. It s user friendly and very light. 
16849 4 Bought a second set of these cables and I sm very happy with the service and fast delivery. 
16850 4 I love this light box - takes a little while to put together, but worth it! I can take pictures of all the craft projects I do anytime! 
16851 0 Camera requires a ridiculous amount of focusing, pictures are blurry, it takes 3 or 5 times to get a non-blurry photo. Recording is blurry too. Just cheap and bad. It s a headache to just take one simple picture with this thing 
16852 4 Good job. 
16853 4 Great!!!!!! 
16854 4 I bought this unit when mine stopped working as a replacement , because the last time it went out, I had no phone and no internet.and I had to wait for 10 days before getting a new one from my provider, this is my backup unit. 
16855 4 excellent power for operation of camera 
16856 2 kept dropping off the network 
16857 4 Works just fine - a great lower cost alternative to the branded unit. 
16858 2 Protects the camera from Water but the audio does get muffled enough to the point where it s not very useful. Construction isn t great but it does the job 
16859 0 Horrible underwater quality, will be returning it. 
16860 3 Can t go wrong for price; primary work is macro. Bought to replace a similar unit that broke after less than a year. Only odd thing is the backside depression where your forefinger rests has locating nubs. It would be more intuitive to have the nubs on the trigger button. 
16861 4 Fast delivery! really good fit! all edges lined up. Thank you 
16862 4 Works as well as the name brand but much more economical! Please with our purchase. (Does fit tightly in the battery compartment so sometimes needs an extra push to get it to pop out). I would purchase again! 
16863 4 Seems to work as well as my OEM battery at a substantially lower price. Hard to beat that. 
16864 0 Wouldn t hold a charge longer than 20 minutes in the cold. the picture was acceptable and would have been fine if the battery would stay charged longer. 
16865 4 nice product for the price. love it. 
16866 4 bought it as a gift for my daughter, she loves it! 
16867 1 They get 2 stars because they are indeed waterproof. But picture quality is terrible- bad color, not sharp, and expensive to process (not too many film processors out there these days!). Don t waste the money unless it s for a kid to play around. 
16868 4 perfect replacement for the hood on my fuji 23mm 1.4, looks like a stock item. 
16869 3 This works great! 
16870 1 glad i got three, plastic and cheap they are i have broke 2 already hoping the 3rd one last until I get my aluminum ones i ordered 
16871 3 perfect 
16872 4 was worried that my battery would not fit.... I was delighted when it did. 
16873 4 Super socks and do stay dry. 
16874 4 I love this camera!!!! I m never without it!!!! The size is perfect and it takes the most fantastic pictures on Auto!!!! I just hold on to it!!! 
16875 0 This camera worked, but it wasn t very easy to open the compartment to change the batteries. The batteries also seemed to die out fast. I wouldn t recommend this camera. 
16876 4 This ring fits well with both sets of threads, no issues whatsoever with this stepping ring. 
16877 4 I love it. .... 😆 
16878 4 Exceptional quality for the price. Easy (and fast) to assemble to put to good use in the studio. 
16879 2 Wish I could see more! its probably just me--- over all easy assembly. 
16880 4 SMALL, COMPACT, AND PORTABLE.... I like it because its nots a big bag and I can just swing it over the shoulders. Has a enough space for small compact camera, charger, cables, batteries, memory cards and several micro fiber cloths. 
16881 4 Works great for my SJ4000 camera. 
16882 3 I got this mainly because I needed a clear filter to protect lens, and this was red on the outside, thought the matching red caps would be cool as well. Cap is cheap, falls off pretty easily with a little bump, but the filter is still nice. 
16883 3 Great filter for the price !! 
16884 4 Amazing 
16885 0 Horrible. Yea it mounts up nice, but once you get driving along, it creaks and rattles so badly I had to take it down. The mounting threads are weak too and will strip if you tighten too tight. I threw mine out. 
16886 4 So far they seem to be very reliable. I ve used them on a couple of jobs and they have worked flawlessly. Time will tell if these were a good investment. 
16887 2 Was missing the leather &#34;guard&#34; that would keep the attachment ring from scratching the camera - I found something else 
16888 4 High quality. 
16889 2 Incredible product, seems to be new, but some screens have problems with resolution, but not much to worry about. Some adaptors also don t match 
16890 3 The batter did arrive promptly and did charge. Assuming it holds it s charge, I ll change to 5 stars. Great price, fast service. 
16891 4 fantastic product! 
16892 3 I miss the viewfinder and you can t take pictures while are filming. In all other features, the camera is great. Wifi is nice, you can take selfi with your camera and send to Internet easily. 
16893 4 It is really easy to install and quick to understand. The video quality is not the best, but you can see everything clearly. I don t know why their are the negative reviews, maybe they are not tech savvy. 
16894 0 Can we say generic?? 
16895 4 Great camera. Does everything they said it would do. 
16896 4 These Marumi filters have gotten good reviews, and I have no complaints. They are well-made and work well. 
16897 3 Good camera. Nice resolution. However, occasionally loses connection to my D-Link AC1750 wireless router which is very close by. A pain to repower when power cord is not within easy reach outside. 
16898 4 It does exactly what it was made to do. The auto adapter cable is a nice bonus. 
16899 4 present for grandaughter, loves it 
16900 4 product as advertised, very good 
16901 4 Fantastic camera. Cannot believe all that it can do. Easy to set-up and use Beside all that the pictures a fantastic 
16902 4 Love it. 
16903 4 Awesome deal 
16904 2 Thanks 
16905 3 Does what its intended to do and fits the instax 7s perfectly, with room to store film 
16906 0 Pretty but so complicate to find how it works, I just want to return it because I try record so many time and this one do not work. The instructions are vague. I still trying to figure out how it works. Never record anything 
16907 4 exactly like the original 
16908 3 I got this item on a discounted price. I found it really helpful for my presentations and projections. I use this to hold my iphone and project it to the screen just like any projector. 
16909 4 Clever design and very sturdy. Easy to add to your bag without weighing you down. 
16910 4 OEM replacement for the Panasonic LX7 and Leica D Lux 6. These cameras are identical, and the batteries are as well/ 
16911 4 Very solid with great optical quality 
16912 3 This is a great item just as good as rocket fish with the clarity but much cheaper. 
16913 4 Love this strap. Would buy again if I had more cameras 
16914 4 so fun! 
16915 4 Used them for our wedding and worked out Great!! 
16916 4 Does the job. Effective on my Rokinon Lenses. Would buy again. 
16917 4 Its good 
16918 4 Very good quality, easy to set up, and easy to use. All good stuff here. No complaints. Have been using for about a month now and no issues to report. 
16919 4 Nice Product works as expected ! 
16920 4 Charges great. Nice replacement. 
16921 4 I have been using this for a while now on boats, on bikes, and underwater. It has worked wonerfully and the quality is great. 
16922 4 Nice addition. 
16923 4 Leaps and bounds better than built in D5200 microphone. It looks great too! Fantastic buy for the price I have some tests on my youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqrVuiG7FXg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rpSp02sbOU Both of these videos were filmed with the mic!! 
16924 4 I needed a new battery for my Nikon D100. This battery works great. Good price, fast service. 
16925 4 saved me a lot of time and headache!!!!!! worked great! 
16926 4 Good replacement at a good price. 
16927 3 Very tight fit. You have to be careful when squeezing the camera in without any lens attached. It will cover the base quite well from any scratches. 
16928 4 it s nice 
16929 4 Worked as intended, kept water out :) 
16930 4 They do the job. Great price. 
16931 0 really can not see the details on the coins like I expected. 
16932 4 Best mirrorless camera I ever owned. In fact, I would put it up against my much more expensive DSLRs. Outstanding features second to none. Especially like the fast continuous shooting and focus. 
16933 4 This is a great product if you use in bright sunlight. Love it 
16934 3 It s a case...It does what it does well. But I love the design, wished there were more options though. The product showed up on time it was packaged professionally. 
16935 4 I appreciate how light and thin it is - easier to tuck in my AC bag 
16936 0 The batteries that came with the charger do not fit the charger. It was returned. 
16937 4 Best price I ve paid yet. So much cheaper then instores 
16938 4 exactly as expected and arrived super quick! 
16939 2 Ok for the price 
16940 3 Its a little smaller than I expected but I love the bag. The many outside pockets make up for the small interior. 
16941 4 A bit pricey, but I used during vacation in Mexico during the summer with success. Going from AC to outside and including snorkeling with 20 dives. No fog at all. It was worth the price to come back with good quality video. 
16942 3 Nice looking camera case. Very protective. Its a little awkward to flip open and let front drop ... I have to hold it out of the way. Still Its a nice case with a placed to screw my monipod. 
16943 3 Love this bag. Great for photographers who don t always have somewhere to sit the bag down to get something out of it. One of the waist bet straps came out of the adjuster, but it was an easy fix. 
16944 4 I have a Nikon coolpix P600 and these are a great fit with quick shipping. I am so happy with these lenses. I have been out everyday since i received them, trying them out. Cant wait until i actually set these up with a tripod. 
16945 3 Quick, easy, cheap green screen. You ll have to iron it out before use (just a note). 
16946 4 Works well even up to 90/100 feet and is very well made. 
16947 1 So far the camera seems fine, all early shots are great. However the additional items in the package were either rather pointless (ear buds to clean the lens!), or useless, such as the camera case which was too small for the camera, and the strap which did not fit. 
16948 4 These are a fantastic value, and I have had no issues charging them, putting them in the GoPro, or removing them from the camera. The charger also charges the standard GoPro battery, which is great. I ll definitely be buying more of these. 
16949 3 Fits what I need wish there were more pockets to store the extras. 
16950 4 Best Camera bag ever! 
16951 3 Very usable,perfect match for the camera 
16952 4 great camera 
16953 0 So much for easy installation! More than 3 weeks later still can t figure out how to install them and have to hire someone to do it :-( 
16954 3 Working well. Easy installation. This is the 3rd camera I bought 
16955 4 Works as expected! 
16956 4 This worked perfectly for cleaning my mirrorless camera sensor. All of the tools I needed in one kit. 
16957 4 amazing pictures 
16958 4 Mine came with a baffle. I put it together in five minutes. Brilliant product for my needs. 
16959 4 Easy to install and remove. Effectively blocks most glare and locks securely on lens. 
16960 4 Great!!!! 
16961 3 Works perfect on Nikon and off camera in S-mode. Bonus that it can be triggered by another flash going off. Build quality good. Only negative is that it over exposes slightly when used on camera in iTTL, though it is easily fixed by compensating. A real bargain at the price. 
16962 4 I really liked this Camera Case. 
16963 1 this is not what I thought it was. I didn t send it back because it cost more to ship it back than to purchase it. 
16964 1 Not delivered as advertised advertising five separate screens received one screen and a case that have different colors on it but not individual screen. this eliminates the ability I m doing a photoshoot with two different screens at one time 
16965 0 Very good 
16966 3 Works ok not consistent with exposure 
16967 4 okey 
16968 4 This is the best security camera i would have ,very easy to connect and is stil working well.I have no regret of buying it. 
16969 4 Very good 
16970 4 Work perfect very satisfied with it 
16971 0 This is only for the camera and strap. There is no lense, no flash, no bag. I was informed after my order was made that this is not what will really be sent. 
16972 4 It is exactly what I needed. It installed easily and feel secure. As for eForceCity they stood behind their product. The first shipment never reached me, they resent the item and I received it as promised. 
16973 4 Great 
16974 0 Synergy Digital substituted an EXPIRED OFF BRAND battery for the listed Synergy battery listed with no resolution. Beware ...you might not get what you purchased! 
16975 3 Great camera. Did an install for a salon & it works great. Very good picture quality too. Recommended. 
16976 4 This is the best floating handle on the market. I use it for my Bahamas trip and it work as intended on the pool and ocean snorkeling. 
16977 4 good float. 
16978 4 After struggling with the original finderscope and many replacements of same with no success, I finally bought this one and was able to align immediately. 
16979 4 Five star 
16980 0 the battery died after only taking 37 pictures. I was at a batchlorette party and missed all the good picture. Very sad. 
16981 4 If you need glasses at all, even just specs, this is a great tool 
16982 3 A little more skinny & spindley than I had hoped... But if you don t put a lot of weight on it or bump it during slow exposure, it should be fine. 
16983 3 Works great, functional, and at a good price. 
16984 4 This is a great solution to the lens cap issue. 
16985 4 Works just as good as the OEM batteries. No camera errors. 
16986 3 Sheds bad... Even after washing.. But photographs beautifully!! I might try combing it out.. 
16987 4 great batteries 
16988 4 Good Product for Such an Economical Price. 
16989 3 Excellent product quality, arrived on time and well packaged. Would definitely recommend if you want to design your own case layout 
16990 2 I bought these batteries to replace the ones that came with our dog s bark collar. They work but don t seem to work as long as other alkaline batteries. 
16991 4 I used it with my Kowa spotting scope at the shooting range. Worked great. Used it to photograph the northern likes with my Canon 70D. Worked great! I used for bird watching. Got great eagle shots. Very steady and versatile. 
16992 4 I loved it. I think this is awesome for the price. 
16993 4 Works awesome as advertised 
16994 4 Bought this for my husband for his Celestron NexStar 6E telescope. The scope, arm and base fit just fine on one side with pouches for accessories on the other side. This is a nice case. Spend the extra money on it. 
16995 4 Great VND filter! Works wonders on the BMCC, since it doesn t have an IR filtration itself. Highly recommend it. I haven t seen any video degradation in my footage while using this filter. In fact, my favorite footage that I ve ever shot using this filter. 
16996 4 Much better quality than a $60 tripod I purchased from Best Buy. I am very pleased with the quality of this product. 
16997 0 I ordered this for my Nikon D40 and the lens caps don t fit on the lens at all and the adapter is way to small to even fit on my camera. this was such a waste of money 
16998 4 Good Communication, very nice product, Item as described A+++ Seller 
16999 4 This is an awesome product. I can email photos to it. No more cables from the computer to the frame required. 
17000 3 Great deal! 
17001 4 Cable gives me super clear audio through my gopro hero 3+ black. It gives both engine audio and radio audio. Postage was also very fast to the UK. Very easy to use. 
17002 4 great bag, very sturdy/comfortable 
17003 0 It worked for a couple days. Now wont turn on. Battery is ok. 
17004 2 Item came without the cord that hooks the camera to a computer. Please send ASAP. Thank you! 
17005 4 This kit had most everything I needed to get me started with my GoPro fast shipping as always and packed perfectly.Great price!! 
17006 4 This goes in my husbands nikon and he is very happy with it. 
17007 4 Awesome! 
17008 4 Does exactly what it s supposed to. 
17009 3 Pretty good, but I ended up with a Tamron 18-270 VC which in my opinion offers slightly better image quality and obviously a killer range. 
17010 0 I d give it 5 stars except for the directions which are unintelligible. Very poor translation. Equipment works great so far. Revised 7/1/16. I m now giving this one star because it failed after less than one year. 
17011 4 I have been testing the cameras, now can suggest that aly004 with onvif technology is faster than p2p camera, the wifi setup is easier configure with lan cable using the software or the app, for now setup throught browser its not avaible. the camera works perfect 
17012 4 It s amazing ! My wife loved it. 
17013 2 Bought these for a Christmas gift, they re okay. Sturdy enough for the price, but even with all four set up, it s hard to get natural tones and eliminate shadows.. 
17014 4 Everything as advertised. Good quality. Good customer follow up. Highly recommended. 
17015 2 It does the job. Its a bit too fragile for my liking. Then again, the price is unbeatable. Had i known though, i would have bought a better, sturdier tripod. 
17016 4 Great kit! 
17017 4 Excellent filters they work great ! take photos during the worst high sub hours without washout. 
17018 4 best deal out there, great camera have used underwater with great results 
17019 3 Cute....no selfie mirror though 
17020 3 Great product very reliable, do not buy the wireless I have seen them fail in the field twice. 
17021 4 :) 
17022 0 Does not record video only audio, horrible item 
17023 3 Great DVR system. It would have gotten 5 stars if it had the hiddns ddns option. Excelente video quality and great mobile app. My customers are very pleased with this system. 
17024 4 Good battery for its price. 
17025 4 This stand works great! Much larger than I thought it was going to be! 
17026 4 Fits my nikon 17-55 perfectly! Great product from a very reputable brand/company! A must have! 
17027 3 Great addition to the Orion 4.5 StarBlast, fills the gap between the 6mm and the 15mm nicely. 
17028 4 Great product!! Would recommend to any Drone Pilot! 
17029 4 my nephew loves it 
17030 4 It s just what I needed. 
17031 4 Works as Advertised...love it... 
17032 4 Use on trips very nice. 
17033 4 Klarus!!! It doesn t get any better! A reliable tactical flashlight that allows single hand use! This should be the go to light for law enforcement! n 
17034 4 great did and still doing it job 
17035 1 good product, so far working very well 8/9/2015. update : night vision not working any more 9/25/2016 
17036 4 Makes shooting with the E-X1 a whole different experience. IMO, the camera should have been made with a better grip in the first place. 
17037 4 Came really quick, lens was great. Did a lot of research on this one and it s almost as good as the nikon counter part, the only difference is its a full stop darker sometimes, but can be adjusted through shutter or iso. Happy shooting! 
17038 4 This product worked great. We took it to Mexico and used it in the ocean, pool and while we were scuba diving. And it did float!! Super quality and worked great! 
17039 4 Great price and great quality. 
17040 4 Nice filters. 
17041 4 Great product! 
17042 4 Dog chewed up my old charger for my camcorder and this package came with everything I needed to start recording again at a great price. 
17043 4 Fairly light-weight, and holds the camera tightly. 
17044 4 My kid s love this looking at the pictures on the camera is not the best but when you upload them they are great and capture all the fun and smiles. I will be getting another for my other kid 
17045 3 Bought it for back-up when we travel 
17046 4 Very nice 
17047 3 Wonderful bag...needs wheels 
17048 4 It gives my baby power. Beautiful power and can t be angry with that......... 
17049 4 Works as expected. 
17050 2 A decent option for the SB-800 
17051 4 FAST shipping. Haven t been out to take some pictures with them, but I expect good results. 
17052 4 perfect perfect perfect 
17053 4 Great product 
17054 2 Bought it. Haven t had to use it. Can t say how good the response is to failure of the device. 
17055 3 8-in-1 for that price?! Hell yes. I use the selfie stick most out of everything. The chest one is pretty good. and so is the thing that like sticks on windows and surfaces haha. 
17056 4 Serviceable and attractive 
17057 4 It was great not flimsy at all for a low price! 
17058 4 Great buy! 
17059 4 The best of the best I use them for continuous lighting for cam shows and they are truly amazing!! 
17060 4 Great deal and they work perfectly. 
17061 4 Just wish I could open port 16 on my pc for full functionality. 
17062 3 god 
17063 4 Much crisper than the MKIII, a little slower but the sharpness is VERY noticeable. I shoot studio and landscape and a def worthwhile upgrade. I will hold onto my MKIII for now and sell when I used it for a month or so. 
17064 0 Nice build, light weight, but really to much trouble to use and adjust when I telescoping stick is so much more convenient 
17065 0 video quality is atrociously blurry, even when the subject is hardly moving. total waste of money 
17066 0 This is a great concept but an extremely cheap product. It s flimsy and the squeeker is tiny. I ll use a dollar store dog toy for the same effect. Not worth the price. Sending it back. 
17067 3 Seems to work real good as a dash can in car, you can also plug a power cord in it and run it all day long, also records over old video s. 
17068 4 The right battery for my Sp-100. Now I have two of them. I bought other batteries but they did not last. great battery. Steve 
17069 2 Heavy and not as much room as expected buy OK! 
17070 4 great price for oem battery. the Wasabi power batteries I have are much cheaper but perform at the same reduced rate, they do not hold charge nearly as long as the factory batteries. 
17071 0 The worst instruction ever. 
17072 4 It is the product I was looking for. Thanks! 
17073 4 Package arrived in perfect condition. 
17074 4 Works good 
17075 3 So far so good! But being my second one, you get what you pay for as well. Take careful care of the part that inserts into the camera when storing and you should get ample use out of it! 
17076 1 Missing parts 
17077 3 Very Good 
17078 2 It was what I wanted a little smaller than I thought but it is OK. 
17079 4 Perfect fit, focus to infinity ! 
17080 4 It works very well for me. I m satisfied in the video quality. Just need a noise reduction for the sound. If you put it in your motorcycle or bicycle and wind blows 30mph. You only hears loud wind and engine. But overall, it s ok. 
17081 4 Works great and easy to store away. In love with with gold one I recieved. Awesome kit if your looking for a selfie stick as well as a tripod. Very nice packaging also. Would make the perfect gift for any age 
17082 4 I love it This is just what I want. JUST PERFECT FOR MY LENS. 
17083 3 Great clear pictures. Using with a Night Owl Dvr system. 1000tvl picture much clearer especially at night. Have 4 and would order more. 
17084 4 Just as expected!!! I love it! 
17085 4 This charger works fast and efficiently. Much better than having to plug in the whole camera. 
17086 0 Does not fit the Canon Powershot SX530 HS as stated by the seller. I wish i had read the other reviews before buying. A total waste of money. 
17087 4 I love the product, as I am using it to inspect small mineral growth. It s perfect for my use as I can take still pictures or video if needed. 
17088 3 Just a question. Since you can put a UV filter on the camera with the lens adapter, can you leave it on when the camera is turned off? I get tired of taking the camera s lens cap on and off. 
17089 3 About what you d expect for the price. 
17090 4 delivered exactly as the image 
17091 4 awesome piece for lens protection THIS IS A MUST, fits tightly, does a perfect job and it looks good on my camera .. now on a side note i feel this is something that should come with the camera already like every other camera around 
17092 3 Great bracket. Great people to work with. The remoter trigger release I received with the bracket didn t fit my Nikon D7100. Had to return it. Got full refund plus my return shipping charge. 
17093 4 Great camera great video excellent point and shoot 
17094 4 Very sharp lens. I was impressed. 
17095 4 good 
17096 4 It is good. And arrive quickly, thanks 
17097 3 very good pic quality, and at wery low cost and fast delivery 
17098 4 Great product and prompt shipment! Thanks!! 
17099 4 I am very happy with my go pro camera very good value with all the asecssories 
17100 4 Great value. Love this camera! 
17101 4 Fantastic on the go tripod I use it all the time when I got out and can t bring my regular tripod 
17102 4 I love my camera. Very happy with the quick delivery. The seller was great. Thank you. 
17103 4 Like it a lot 
17104 4 ok 
17105 3 I love my camera. I suggest if you aren t familiar with this camera that you read up on its usage. The company did not adhere to the timeline set forth from them with sending the package. 
17106 3 i wish it came with big enough back drops, they are not big enough at all, everything else is 100% 
17107 3 Didn t fit the camera I got it for, but still found a way to make it work. 
17108 4 The color as same as photo👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 
17109 3 Works without a problem with my Sony minicam. The only reason not five stars is that the charger can hold only one battery at a time. I would have loved to be able to charge both at the same time. 
17110 4 These lights are great. I bought one for every closet, and one above front door keyhole. Everyone who walks in my front door asks me where I got it. 
17111 4 good product 
17112 4 Good quality and works as described. 
17113 4 Great quality, cleans well and can be washed and used many times over. 
17114 4 I ve never been able to take such amazing pictures before with any other camera. Best camera I ve ever had! 
17115 4 Excelent product 
17116 4 great buy for the money 
17117 4 Exactly as described, fit my Canon Rebel Xti like a glove. Very happy with the purchase 
17118 4 These sunglasses are outstanding they re great I haven t had any problems whatsoever I would just like to say thank you for such a great product at such a great price 
17119 2 Hard to put items in place 
17120 4 I absolutely love this camera and the bundle was much more than I anticipated. I had one small issue with one of the items in the bundle and Focus Camera replaced it almost immediately. 
17121 2 It does it s job. I find it is just a cheap feeling replacement. It often doesn t thread as nicely as the original Nikon HB-32 lens hood. The extra included microfiber is a nice addition, but doesn t make me feel any better about the lens hood. 
17122 3 Works very well, but very poor manual. We use it for an elderly person who is in hospice care. We get a good clear picture night or day from anywhere. If you leave your phone on all night to constantly monitor there is significant white noise from your phone. 
17123 4 Fit great... 
17124 4 Surprised! Very nice lens for a bargain price. I purchased it for my daughter s film class along with a used canon élan ii body and tested on a Rebel T4i with great results. 
17125 4 Works as intended, it s great. 
17126 4 Good 
17127 3 Works very well. I use this a lot and have had no issues with it. 
17128 4 Great technical support! Technician handled my request in an efficient, courteous, and professional manner. Camera works great both local and remote. 
17129 4 Works good havent had a ptoblem yet 
17130 0 Foscam seems to have stopped supporting their products. j 
17131 4 Awesome! 
17132 4 Works perfectly for my 50mm Nikon Lens. Thanks! 
17133 4 I bought this over 3 years ago and I love it still. If you still keep an old camera you know how easy it is to lose your charger. It comes in handy on trips or when you just need a little bit of juice. 
17134 4 Great work, and speedy delivery. 
17135 3 It was a birthday present for my son who has started a small photography business, and he is very pleased with the performance, while I was very pleased by the price. 
17136 4 was very happy with product, arrival was persise. 
17137 4 Awesome, best quad I have used. Having a memorial service for mine today. Taken out by a white SUV :( 
17138 4 Replaced a lost cable. It works well. 
17139 4 excellent product 
17140 4 Absolutely what I wanted!! 
17141 4 Great!! 
17142 4 Fits my camera perfect, really like having it protected and the extra space for more sd cards. 
17143 3 works as it is supposed to. 
17144 4 I used this camera to record the school musical. It was easy to use, light weight and produced a beautiful picture and sound. I do think it works best with a stand of some sort. My arm was tired holding it. I did get a stand. 
17145 4 Works great, fits well. 
17146 4 great! 
17147 4 Very handy. Each is individually packaged. 
17148 4 Paired with a couple Nikon flashes, no one would be able to look at the photo and say &#34;You didn t spend $500 on that flash you used.&#34; 
17149 4 Works great, suction is strong. I have used it mounting my GoPro to my Mustang when racing and it s never fallen off. Even mounted to the side of my car it stays on. 
17150 1 Low light performance is unacceptable. 
17151 4 Ok 
17152 4 will order from them again. was exactly as what was posted 
17153 4 A OK.... 
17154 4 Perfect camera 
17155 1 Camera seems to work fine, but is not a US version. From what I m reading this is a version from a different country and has no warranty here in the US...... 😯 
17156 0 Would not set up with windows 8.1 I returned it. I spent way too much time trying to set this up. Not a plug n play camera... 
17157 3 Works. Could be a little clearer 
17158 4 Go with camkix Unless you want it to say gopro on it 
17159 2 cheaper made than I thought but it was only like 10 or 11 bucks 
17160 4 Best selfie decision ever 
17161 4 This is not your same old peel stick sheild it is much better go on line see how they say to put it on take the time it is worth it and the sheild fits great 
17162 0 This camera is junk. You get what you pay for. Could not for the life of me get it to work correctly. Would not recognize my SD card and could not get it to connect to my computer. 
17163 3 Cheap and great quality. I lost my old one for my 2007 Canon Powershot. I was glad to find one here on Amazon. 
17164 4 This bag is a great bag, I knew it was a good choice the second i opened the package. it seems to be of solid construction. 
17165 4 I have only had this for a few days, but the batteries work (have to be charged when they arrive, no biggie), The charger seems to work. The package arrived on time and in good condition. The price was great. We have the cybershot WX9. 
17166 4 This is a very good camera case and i would highly recommend it. 
17167 4 cheap, holds long charge, good quality. 
17168 4 This is the only battery I use for my camera. It is a long lasting battery, holds it charge very well. I recommend this battery highly. 
17169 4 As advertised, was shipped and arrived in a timely manner. Would purchase again 
17170 0 Absolutely no customer support. Software is crap. 
17171 4 Battery works like a charm! delivery was very quick!!!! 
17172 2 Great product, however wasn t shipped on time. 
17173 4 Excellent camera!! 
17174 3 seems to work fine so far 
17175 4 Awesome if you have more than one battery. You always have one charged and ready to go 
17176 4 Outstanding product. Delivered quickly and the instructions are very simple. Now looking for soft case to store this product on my Tokina 16-28mm lens. 
17177 4 This selfie stick came just as pictured .Works great with my iPhone 5s syncs to Bluetooth feature .Perfect for traveling and being packed away as its compact size allows for easy storage ! Zoom feature is awesome .Takes great group pictures I recommend this product 
17178 4 Very sharp lens. Produces some really great images on the Nikon D810. 
17179 4 does all that is advertised so far... 
17180 3 Perfect for my 8ch DVR 
17181 4 Purchased for a friend, His D5200 was always draining the factory battery. I purchased this brand for My Canon & was so pleased, I got one for His Nikon. 
17182 0 Cheaply made. 
17183 0 I have only had this for four months and used it for three indoor shoots. The AC power cord stopped working in the middle of the third shoot. Very frustrating that I cannot return....this product stinks! $300 down the drain! 
17184 4 Got these lights very fast. Great price for such versatile lights. Came well packaged and the lights perform very well. The fact that these lights are portable and battery operated too is a plus! Helps out lots for outdoors shoots. Very satisfied customer 
17185 3 This camera has more than everything you will need. The tripod is a little weak, and the bag a little small... but the lens options and the wireless mic make this an ideal camera for quick filming and interview pieces. 
17186 0 smells horrible 
17187 3 Easy to install. I just put it on and it looks good so far. Decent price. Fast shipping. 
17188 4 Love the product. Made it so much easier having back-up batteries...and ones that last longer than my original one!! I highly recommend this valuable deal! 
17189 3 fits iPhone onto strap. 
17190 4 Great backdrop we used at our wedding! Quick shipping too! 
17191 4 Perfect and great price! Just what I needed. 
17192 4 Just received this item a few days ago and I am very pleased. It is exactly like the GoPro version, but for less than half the cost. It is very sturdy and easy to use. 
17193 2 Lens with good quality optics. However, the focus mechanism seems noisy & always try very hard with AF. Noisy barrel synonymous to poor quality control. May need to send back for either exchange or repair. 
17194 4 Love it 
17195 0 It did not fit my Canon G16 as stated it would, had to return it. 
17196 4 Works perfectly, just what I needed 
17197 4 Good strap! 
17198 4 Good package for a first timer with drones. 
17199 3 Its good. 
17200 4 Good product 
17201 0 No good bad quality even on HD wasted a lot of money on this pretty disappointed 
17202 4 my sister loves her camera takes excellent pictures and the picture quality is good 
17203 4 Performed as expected. Great for lithium batteries. 
17204 4 Its a great lens but very heavy. Pictures are sharp. 
17205 3 Only problem is screws are not stainless 
17206 4 Great value!!! So much fun to shoot with! Lots of useful tools came in the package. 
17207 3 I love my new Nikon. 
17208 3 all within expectation... 
17209 0 The camera does not take clear pictures. I can no longer return it and can t get a hold of the seller. 
17210 0 great price, lasted 5 months and will not hold a charge now 
17211 4 Wonderful! 
17212 4 Pure class. A Leica M6 with this strap slung around the neck and shoulder look as much like a major fashion statement as it is functional. Perfect. 
17213 4 Every piece of my New Nikon D7100 fits perfect in my new Backpack and it s comfy so far. Thank you 
17214 4 Works well 
17215 4 Great lens for the price. 
17216 3 Works. Bends. Stiff. Durable. 
17217 4 Nice Umbrella s. Work as expected. 
17218 2 Its nice and i thought it had a button and stuff but be careful what u buy 
17219 3 Works good but it s not too comfortable to use it. 
17220 0 Did NOT fit the Canon PowerShot G7X AT ALL. I wrote to them saying I wasn t going to bother with shipping it back. 
17221 4 Very solid and well constructed. Would buy again. 
17222 3 Good product. Would have given it 5 stars if it had a screw on ring to connect a carabineer. 
17223 4 good stuff 
17224 0 doesn t fit the lens. 
17225 4 Easy to get, cheaper by far than others I found 
17226 4 kenneth helped me greatly with my camera. I love foscam cameras. Customer service will talk you through and walk you through the issues you may have. 
17227 4 Great product 
17228 3 my husband loves the camera 
17229 2 Help protect my canon 70 D from rain. 
17230 4 I LOVE THIS CAMERA BAG. 
17231 1 Pretty good design, plenty of padding, but the top strap broke loose on the first use. 
17232 0 Poor quality, sound was spotty... Sometimes it worked sometimes it did not. Nest is better. 
17233 2 Just FYI ... With this camera or any camera you plan to use indoors for outdoor survalience, buy an inexpensive 55mm or smaller Polarized lens filter and figure out a way to gently attach it. This removes 90% of &#34;window glare&#34; from the equation. 
17234 4 Does the job. I carry this in the belt pouch with my filters so it always at hand. No problems with it. Great product at a great price. 
17235 4 Good 
17236 4 Durable and lightweight. Great product. 
17237 4 Great!! 
17238 4 Amazing. Does everything it claims to. 
17239 0 i got to alaska with my package and realized...NO charger was included and all the shops we went to did not have chargers...should have just bought in person 
17240 4 Works perfectly speedy shipping 
17241 4 Item was better than I thought! Extremely pleased! 
17242 1 This has been very difficult to hook up and view out side of the home. The software is typical import stuff that seems to have been quickly throw together. 
17243 4 Fits like OEM eyecup. Good deal! 
17244 4 Awesome and affordable.Recomend it for starters 
17245 4 Great quality and strength. I ve used this for multiple shoots through cities over the course of 15 hours. Holds up well, feels decent on back 
17246 4 10 points. everything was as expected 
17247 4 Took this white water rafting and stayed on my life vest the whole time. The clip is very tight, sometimes even a little difficult but perfect to secure a camera. 
17248 4 This is a great product! Affordable and fast shipping. I really only needed the dust blower to clean my camera. The extra accessories were bonus! Would recommend and would buy again from this seller. 
17249 4 Great remote trigger, the button has a slide lock for shooting bulb. Nothing to complain about. 
17250 3 Good carry-gopro-bag! 
17251 4 Product is fantastic. I highly recommend. A good value and works perfectly. Software is flawless. 
17252 4 excellent product, very satisfied with tripod. 
17253 4 Good 
17254 4 very good item delivered as expected. 
17255 4 A very clever and useful tool for dolly shots 
17256 4 attaches easily and securely. 
17257 4 Installation is simple and easy. Like others said, the sticky tape provided is not good and used 3M extreme mounting tape. All sensors are working with factory settings. No issue. 
17258 4 I got my order on time and it was.perfect 
17259 4 Takes great pictures 
17260 4 an inexpensive and super wide lens 
17261 4 Very happy with this purchase. 
17262 4 Good build and design. Tripod mount is metal under center of lens. No block on speaker and LCD monitor tilts downward and upwards. Good weight balance with XF23. Feels good in my hands better than Fuji hand grip MHG-XT10 especially with bigger lens like XF56. 
17263 4 It works perfectly. 
17264 4 Camera worked Great I love it so much. Shipping was only 10 days. I would definitely recommend this camera 
17265 4 Wife loves it. 
17266 2 Worked fine, but would sometimes stick when trying to extend, and was difficult to fix. 
17267 4 Exactly what i wanted to replace the one i broke. 
17268 4 Works as expected. Great to have the camera working again. 
17269 3 work great 
17270 4 Perfect just exactly the safety we were needing. 
17271 4 Bought for a 8 year old fishing nut and he loves it! Caught his biggest fish shortly after receiving this camera! 
17272 4 Lenses caps fit tightly, and the elastic band is strong. I have one of these on each of my lenses, as I do a lot of active shots. This is a great buy. 
17273 4 perfect 
17274 4 except for the labeling, battery is exactly the same as the one that came with the camera. Charged it up and away I went. Works great. Nice to have a spare so you don t have to be charging all the time. 
17275 1 Smaller and not as stretchy as the write-ups imply. 
17276 4 Everything was a presented. i thought the case was a little bigger but my wife says it s fine and she is the one using it.. 
17277 4 This grip works great and easy to use. Slides on without any problems. Does add some bulkyness to the camera. Did not break and was not defective. 
17278 4 Worked well on my dive trip. 
17279 4 This product was as advertised. Everything was present and the shipping was on time. Having only played around with most of the features of this kit, I would say that I m impressed with its quality and price. 
17280 4 great lens 
17281 4 LOVE IT! My lens arrived on time and came in perfect condition. The box was wrapped as if it was brand new. The Lens had no scratches on it. Definitely worth the price. 
17282 4 My 7-year old Cyber-shot camera died and I was glad I could replace it with one that was similar: pretty much the same features and operation, uses same card and battery, not too expensive. It will be way cool if I can squeeze 7 years out of this one. 
17283 4 this quadcopter is amazing! the camera is super clear and stable in flight. the controls are a cinch to handle. Its great in wind and will stay very stable using the gps. really, its incredible. Photos are super clear. 
17284 4 Love it! 
17285 3 Really good 
17286 4 Great service, quick ship. Product packaged really, really well. So far the product performs as I expected. No complaints! 
17287 4 Excellent polarizer. Build quality is good. Does an amazing job at removing reflections (see attached photos). One must be mindful of the exposure time however as it does darken the image some and the best way to compensate without having to use a tripod is to increase ISO. 
17288 4 Nothing fancy, but for the price you can t beat it. It fits my canon g7x. 
17289 1 This camera was working as advertised for 2-3 years, but this summer, I took it to the beach and water got into the camera (LCD screen area) even though the latch was locked. Now the camera doesn t work. 
17290 4 Fits my camera-plenty of room to add on devices. 
17291 4 The camera arrived on time. Took on vacation this summer. Takes very good pictures and the price was right. 
17292 0 Camera does not work and phone app does not recgnize camera. Two thumbs down!!! 
17293 4 Very good 
17294 4 My 15 yo daughter loves it! 
17295 4 Just what I wanted for a great price! 
17296 4 I use this frequently when I am taking landscapes. It weighs nothing, is simple to connect, and works flawlessly. Cable is just the right length. 
17297 3 Package deal with all the extras for your new camera 
17298 4 They hold sand like they re supposed to. 
17299 4 I am starting in DSLR cameras and the Nikon D3200 is perfect for beginners who wanto to grow at fast rate. 
17300 4 I use camera batteries as fast as I can charge them. These Vivitar batteries last as long as my Canon batteries & these are A Lot cheaper in cost! I use them in my Canon SX700 HS. Also fast shipping by seller. 
17301 0 was supposed to be color, but the prints come out almost sepia. would not buy again. 8 prints for over 20.00 should be good quality 
17302 4 absolutely SOLID !!!! my original broke while skiing, it ruins the day it is well worth the peace of mind. feels heavier but it isnt. 
17303 4 I was happy with my lens filter 
17304 4 great camera 
17305 4 Fits tight but not to tight 
17306 4 Works fine for what I needed it for. 
17307 4 Fits perfectly in the hot shoe on my A6000 
17308 0 Camera works great! Software is smooth. Easy to connect. Update: This camera sends all of your video to the &#34;Cloud&#34; located in China. If you are into privacy I suggest you try a camera that connects to your home WiFi network rather than directly to the Internet. 
17309 3 Fits well. Keeps things clean. 
17310 3 Nice camera for the price. Be aware that it comes in at 240, the 933 cameras come in at 480, so this is not quite as sharp. Does the job for what I need, tho I do wish I would have known this before I bought it. 
17311 4 Great device for controlling lights! Representative AR004627 was a great help on DLINK 
17312 4 Wonderful product. We use it on our binos. Great quality. Love the soft neck strap. 
17313 4 I m using this with a Fuji X-E1 - works great. 
17314 4 SUPER PRODUCTO 
17315 3 Works great, has a few quirks to get used to. 
17316 2 Gets the job done but the instructions are not very good! Tilt function did not work. 
17317 4 Great product have been using it for years. 
17318 0 Item shipped was not as described/pictured. 
17319 4 Still going strong, after all these years. Great quality and design. Very light weight too. Great for trips and special occasions. 
17320 4 Good 
17321 3 Works great, suitable for close recording in low light areas. 
17322 4 Thanks! 
17323 4 Great camera. PTZ and connects with wifi about 200 feet away. 
17324 4 These things really are magic. We use ours to remote mount cameras and flashes at weddings. The versatility of this arm is amazing... and worth every penny. 
17325 4 As described! Better than expected! 
17326 3 This battery replaces one that been in use for a couple of years... best recommendation I can give. 
17327 2 Good camera case but wish had more space to get extra SD cards etc 
17328 4 It works as expected! 
17329 4 Cap perfectly fits and has a very good quality, almost as good as original one, also it has a hole and a string to attach it to camera, its very helpful 
17330 3 This soft box is great for the price! It was easy to set up and does the job well. Getting it back in the pouch was a little hard but the same could be said about 99% of these things! 
17331 4 Item just as stated. Worked perfectly 
17332 4 So good The best color calibration tool 
17333 3 The battery is good so far. I will find out more when I take them to a long vacation next week. The battery can only be charge with the Nikon Coolpix W130 NOT W120. Don t know why? 
17334 4 My sister in law loves it and is easy to use if you are familiar with smart phones. 
17335 0 Neither of the batteries worked in my camera even though they were the correct type and model, 
17336 4 Sturdy step up ring, nothing fancy, does what it needs to do. Bundled cleaning cloth is a bonus. 
17337 4 Good price, solid metal construction. Fits on my A7S well and it is easy enough to take off. No light leaks that I can see. 
17338 3 Night vision sucks everything else a+ 
17339 3 I like it, it s small 
17340 4 Nifty 50 works great on my Canon Rebel T3i! 
17341 2 keeps popping off 
17342 4 Perfect fit work great! 
17343 3 Pretty good, for the price. Not the best quality mask or camera, but it has lasted a couple of years and it captured some good memories. 
17344 4 Great price for getting two backup batteries for my SX 510. 
17345 3 As far as the camera image quality is concerned, great, as well as the sound too. However, the lack of email alerts is a must have which this camera/software does not offer. The app you use with the cam is buggy at best at alerting you. 
17346 4 Super fun case 
17347 4 This contraption is perfect. Fits really snug and you can make any and all adjustments needed to get the perfect fit. My first time using this was for an alpine rollercoaster in Austria with no breaks. Solid and sturdy. Two thumbs up. 
17348 4 So far so good quality hardware. 
17349 4 Very cute album ! I thought it would be a little bigger but it s ok! 5 stars! 
17350 4 Bought a few times now. No problems at all. Everyone loves it at the party. 
17351 2 Good space, good side pockets, but........ shoulder belt side holders (hooks) are a disaster, totally broken with only a lifted. The dividers are poorly sewn, too much thread around 
17352 0 doesn t hold a charge as well as my other batteries, my camera shows the health as 2 of 3 bars when new. 
17353 4 Great heavy duty and heavy 
17354 4 Henry was excellent. He took over my computer remotely and fixed the issue within a few minutes. 
17355 4 Nice bag when you want something light and don t need a lot of protection. Great price. 
17356 4 A must to protect your camera. 
17357 4 love it 
17358 3 Excellent lens - A little bigger than the older I Had, a compact 20-50 ..which started with an 00 error and ended, a month later with a dead diaphragm, making all the photos totally dark. I m very satisfied with the Samsung NX 18 55mm 
17359 2 It s decent for the price. It does spin and after couples uses got a little sloppy. I Used it in the water mostly it hasn t rusted. 
17360 4 Excellent product and service 
17361 2 Good 
17362 4 Arrived right before my trip out of the country and it worked perfectly to charge my recorder! 
17363 4 Just what it s supposed to do. It connects an Olympus EM-10 to your computer. 
17364 3 Ok 
17365 3 Good functionality and fits the ARLO camera perfectly. It is a white/grayish color. Definitely different from the Netgear Arlo white. Although this doesn t bother me, it provides the angles I need so it s good! 
17366 4 Excellent 
17367 0 I did not received NIkon L28 20.1 MP the one I ask for. 
17368 4 This backdrop is pretty large, but it gets the job done wonderfully. 
17369 0 Very thin like a shower curtain liner, I was upset when I opened it up. 
17370 4 I would buy again with no hesitation 
17371 3 charger usb collapsed and broke ! purchase a separate charger! everything else very well 
17372 4 Easy to use for a beginner Sturdy stand nice lens 
17373 4 This is the perfect products for my camera! 
17374 4 This was for my father, and it is great. Simple, functional, unexpensive, compact, the menus could be easier to use but my 70 year old father learnt the basics and be happy with it. 
17375 4 Excellent for price for what it does 
17376 4 Fits perfectly 
17377 4 Exactly like factory cap, fits perfect. 
17378 4 This lens hood is nice, and works probably just about as well as the Canon one. The only problem that I have is reversing the hood. Other than that, it works well for pictures and video. It s a good buy. 
17379 3 Using this on an ASP-C sensor (A-6000) to great advantage as a 36-360 mm. Sharpest just beyond close focus. Great bokah at widest f stops. 
17380 4 Works like a charm. 
17381 4 Works great!!! 
17382 3 I have an older Nikon Coolpix point and shoot and its wobbly on this tripod. I got it for shooting videos outdoors so I can attach to a tree limb and it should be fine. The loose part is right at the junction of the 3 legs. 
17383 2 The product was good once hooked up, but the instructions and software did not work well. I had to program the cameras by using a direct IP interface. If you have some IT know how, you can get to work. 
17384 4 OK 
17385 4 great batteries 
17386 4 Very good camera great photos very good 4k video 
17387 4 Worked perfectly with a Canon 6D and a 24-105mm lens in a trip to Yosemite. 
17388 4 Fits perfect, Love it 
17389 3 Works just fine. Easy to connect to phone. Easy to use the companion app. Photo colors are alright but a tad off. Ink doesn t smear. 
17390 0 Died just after using for 2 nights. 
17391 4 Danny was so great! helped me for over an hour! 10000% HAPPY! GREAT CAMERA ALSO! 
17392 0 Nice looking but the snaps are low quality. First time I unsnapped the top piece the snap broke off. Replacement snaps are difficult to find. 
17393 4 Amazing quality and works great 
17394 0 It doesn t give any information it s very expensive and you don t know what your buying 
17395 4 Excellent product. I used the filters easily and the results were as expected. I recommend it 100%. 
17396 3 Magnets and snaps could be stronger - front flap frequently falls of when trying to use camera Nice styling. 
17397 4 Wow! What a great product at a great price! 
17398 4 Great, same as the name brand just way cheaper. 
17399 4 great 
17400 4 Excellent case. Highly durable and a good price. Fits all your gear for your go pro. The pocket on the inside is a great feature. Everything fits in the foam snugly and wont go anywhere or get damaged. A+ 
17401 4 Very good camera case. Basic, with some useful pockets well made. 
17402 3 changed out the battery for wife s Sony camera and it works as good as the original battery and didn t cost very much 
17403 4 awesome and seals 
17404 0 When i bougt it i think there is a cable for i phone 6, but it dose not 
17405 4 Great little camera. Has an external mic plug so we can plug it into the church sound system. Getting nice videos. 
17406 0 Waste of money, none of then worked 
17407 3 Great idea, Needs more solar panels...charges WAY to slow but it does work 
17408 4 Nice 
17409 0 When they say it fits the GoPro 1... they must mean a different one than what I have. Mine came with a case that isn t removable. I had to return the case and just replace the piece that came off. Bummer. 
17410 2 Liked the feel, weight and capabilities but went for the Samsung WB2200f instead 
17411 4 The knurling of the ring makes the rotation of the filter easy through the hole in the lens hood of my new Canon 100-400 zoom. Much easier to use. 
17412 2 Works ok will not transfer video. Make sure to put in airplane mode when transferring. 
17413 4 Works fantastically. Would definitely recommend 
17414 4 This little camera works great. Had some trouble with the wireless connection. But thanks to the excellent tec support this little camera is working fine. Thank you Mylene #AR004212 case# c6721279. Ask for her she s great. 
17415 4 Very fine 
17416 3 I like it and am enjoying it for the purpose I bought this for... I ll be back for more, it works amazingly well! 
17417 4 These are great. I lose these all the time so its nice that they come with 6 in a pack. They work well with or without a cleaner. Great for my iphone and ipad and they also are great on eye glasses. 
17418 4 This is my second Targus USB 2.0 Digital Card Reader and it works great. 
17419 4 Lasts longer than factory battery and multi use charger is handy for trips. 
17420 4 Henry performed a Remote Install for the FOSCAM F19816P camera I purchased. He performed the install without any problems got the install completed in less than 45 minutes. Very pleased with his service. Real pleased with the quality of pictures from the FOSCAM. 
17421 4 Easy to use and setup whether you use it internally or view from external networks. View on 3 iPhones, iPad and a computer. Haven t tried the SD Card features. 
17422 4 Extremely happy with my purchase. This camera is so easy to operate and takes beautiful photos. Already wanting to buy some better lenses! 
17423 3 a bit tight fit 
17424 4 Great kit for any phone to help with pics 
17425 3 Great buy for the money. 
17426 4 Thank you! 
17427 4 Most excellent range. Superb build. Prime focus points throughout. Travelling through India with this lens has been a pleasure. Few other lenses were needed. And it has been rained on, smashed against trains, auto rickshaws, and mass humanity. No problems but real fun. 
17428 4 So far, am quite happy with it. I have not used it much yet, still learning how to use it. 
17429 4 We bought these cameras for three rooms in our house and I love them!!! They work great and are at an amazing price!! We plan on buying more!!! 
17430 4 It s good 
17431 4 Great 
17432 4 I love this product. It allows me to know when someone comes down the driveway and extra security at night. I plan on getting another set and putting on the steps on the deck to protect the back of the house. 
17433 2 This Tripod gets the job done, but it is extremely flimsy. I thought it would ve been a little thicker to be able to hold my canon t5i comfortably. 
17434 4 This is just the ticket for all the extra things you need while videoing. The arm is very strong and as long as you keep the weight even it doesn t bob up and down and all around. Very useful to a videographer. 
17435 1 all 4 are exactly the same, all have the same product number 
17436 4 Great! 
17437 4 Very good walkaround lens. Beware it´s big and a bit on the heavy side but this is a step up from any kit lens. You won´t regret it. 
17438 3 Good fit for Nikon d3100 
17439 1 It is a real nice looking case, but it is too small. 
17440 3 it has alluminum legs, very stable even w/ a 4 lb binocular. 
17441 4 This is exactly what i need to work on my youtube videos with 
17442 4 Works well as a replacement for the Leica batteries that came with my camera. 
17443 4 I m not reviewing the product, the product didn t work out for me, not that its bad, it wasn t compatible. The service of the seller was excellent, resolved the issue well, stayed in contact throughout. thank you 
17444 1 No instructions at all. Still trying to figure it out for android and no way will it mount on the binoculars. 
17445 0 it broke literally 10 minutes after getting into the water and I lost my brand new camera! 
17446 1 We purchased this case to work with Nikon S9900, unfortunately it didn t fit well. It was extremely tight fit and we re afraid it might scratch the camera. We returned the case immediately. Positive side, it arrived quick. 
17447 4 Works as it should. I would have desired a power cord to plug in, but with 4 AA batteries and the LED system, it works just fine. The more solid diffusion rings are a bonus. Using with Sony A and 49 mm without issue. 
17448 4 Well built, provides extra space and cushion for SLR cameras, I m using this one with a canon EOS 60D with 18-135mm lenses. I m able to fit battery charger and extra memory easily. 
17449 4 As expected. Got to see Jupiter and Saturn with it in a clear night. It s pretty cool. 
17450 4 Sweet charger, not as fast as I expected. But it works great, and easy to charge, too! Fast shipment, packaged well, and a great price. Thanks! 
17451 4 excellent! 
17452 4 as advertised 
17453 4 nice camera for the price 
17454 3 I m still finding things to use. I just got done with an afternoon of wearing the head mount while I was climbing a tower [inside] and walking on campus. Worked great. 
17455 4 I m really satiafied with this great combo. 
17456 3 Great, but be careful not to over-tighten. 
17457 4 Excellent choice of lenses at a very good price and very nicely packaged for easy transport with my camera. 
17458 3 Light and cheap, fits perfectly, but to be honest the original ECG-1 is better - more grippy, slimmer base which is better for pinky finger and doesn t get so cold, so if you can get that one, I would recommend it more. 
17459 0 Very low quality. Short life. 
17460 2 Lots of missing items, the camera s fine though 
17461 4 This is a great buy. Also my neighbors think that I have a real security surveillance system. It a great but to deter Crime. The blinking solid red lights on the camera make is look realistic. 
17462 4 Great 
17463 0 The hook broke after couple of months. I never received any response to my email. 
17464 4 Awesome mount and fitting is perfect. Used it at the beach and caught awesome moments. Well worth it s price. 
17465 4 I definitely needed this! 
17466 3 Perfect. Just prepare for long wait, arrived 10 days past due, but it works good. 
17467 4 This is a wonderful lens 
17468 4 Good 
17469 4 Fits my Nikon D7100 and was very useful in shooting in rainy Alaska. 
17470 4 Good deal/product 
17471 4 This scope works exactly as I expected, using the Cheese app on the Fedora 22 version of Linux. A problem with the ON/OFF switch on the first unit I received was quickly resolved by an immediate vendor replacement. 
17472 4 Works great and charges my batteries quite fast. 
17473 4 I like it very well and work great in many positions and keeps secure. Thanks!! 
17474 2 I m criticizing myself...not the product. I should have noticed that I was buying BOTH a remote and a camera cleaning kit. The remote can be purchased by itself for around $20 elsewhere on Amazon. 
17475 4 Works well, no issues. Great price and does the job. 
17476 4 Probably one of my favorite GoPro accessories. I can easily get the footage I need when doing a run and its easily transportable. I personally think there is less shake vs the head and chest strap. 
17477 4 It is smaller than expect but the resolution on the screen is great. 
17478 4 Love them 
17479 4 Excellent 
17480 2 Kool look will fool you but the only thing it blanks, and a real cam don t. 
17481 3 Giving a 4 start only because it lacks the ability to collapse it to store in your camera bag... But for the price I wouldn t complain... 
17482 0 Item worked once and then stopped working. 
17483 4 Love it. 
17484 4 Everything we needed! 
17485 4 it works really great on iphone and android. I bought this one for a gift but i tried it first to be sure it works pretty well and my friend loves it! 
17486 4 My wife loves it! Still learning how to rock the shot but getting some amazing photos. 
17487 4 Works perfectly with camera and charger. So happy! 
17488 4 like the colored borders 
17489 4 For short footages is an ideal tool. Lightweight, strong and confortable make me gladder that I though 
17490 2 The joint and plates themselves seem to be pretty well made, but the shipment lacked the hardware necessary to connect the case to the plate. Be prepared to supply your own nuts. 
17491 0 This camera does not have a jack to support an external microphone. 
17492 2 clarity was less than expected 
17493 4 Love this paper. The color works very well for my children and maternity sessions. 
17494 4 Perfect for what I needed 
17495 4 People keep running into my wife and I ve looked for a decent little camera to use in the car. Then, some neighbor dogs attacked her while out walking ours, she needed something to clip on and take with her. This little baby does both pretty darn well. 
17496 4 fast shipping will do more business 
17497 3 I have just used this remote shutter at the fireworks show on Aug 22nd without problem. 
17498 4 Crystal clear focus without the Image Stabilizer! This is wonderful. The USM is required if you need quiet such as photographing wildlife. 
17499 4 a 
17500 3 great product great price works as description 
17501 0 Poor product had to send it back twice product was open already and used 
17502 2 the tripod assembly is a tad difficult when assembling the unit, but other than that a fine refractor. 
17503 4 Even though it s a little harder to carry this case with you everywhere it does hold alot if you are going out to take pictures. 
17504 4 Great product, and perfect little photos for keepsakes, would recommend to edit photos on your phone and increase the contrast and saturation since the pictures do fade a little bit when they print, but overall I m pleased with the products 
17505 4 Great price for a nice, basic camera case. Item holds up well. 
17506 4 Great kit! 
17507 4 Very happy with the picture provided. 
17508 3 works nice 
17509 3 Lightweight, and quick and easy to assemble. Material could be a bit sturdier, but as is, works well with paper or other lightweight backdrops. 
17510 3 Functional 
17511 4 Perfect for what we wanted. Works very well, easy to use. 
17512 4 Kenneth was a great help setting up my Foscam to send email when motion is detected. He is quick polite and knows his data. Thanks Kenneth, Jerald 
17513 4 Great product and fun for many events. Everyone loves it. 
17514 2 Camera does a decent job even in relatively low light. The housing clip got loose after only a couple of uses. 
17515 4 Great Items.. My customers are really happy... 
17516 4 Excelkente! Fits all accessories! 
17517 3 Good finish and packaging macro lens is also good 
17518 4 Very handy item,more when you forget the charger, and have one fully charged in your pocket. 
17519 4 Great camera for any small application especially for FPV embedded in racing quads. I have had a few cameras on various models. Also, comes with easy to use wiring harness for attaching to video transmitters such as FatShark/Immersion. 
17520 3 So far so good. SOMETIMES the individual items move around and that should t be. Otherwise no problems 
17521 3 good 
17522 4 Great! 
17523 4 Grate 
17524 2 great idea, not great implementation, doesnt slip on or fit easily onto the screen 
17525 4 So cute 
17526 4 Works great 
17527 4 works as planned, ideally matching the a6000. 
17528 4 Works good and in new condition. 
17529 4 Product is exactly what was advertised 
17530 4 This accessory fits perfectly for my camera! 
17531 4 As an owner of both a Gopro 3, and Gopro 4, this is a fantastic charger than can handle BOTH batteries, and can recharge from my computer s USB port. 
17532 4 Super filter for the money! 
17533 4 Is as advertised 
17534 4 Perfect - does what it says on the tin! Very sturdy and easy to fit 
17535 4 Works great, fantastic feal! 
17536 4 Works fine at a good price. 
17537 4 Delivery on time. Was due for new battery, old one about 5 yrs old and wasn t holding charge very well 
17538 4 Works well. I have only tested this and not actually put it to use. It should eliminate the camera shake when I press the shutter release button. 
17539 4 Does exactly as it s supposed to do. 
17540 4 I love it. 
17541 0 This camera is pure garbage. Until iIbought this camera I ve hadn t ever submitted a review or even a star rating. Now I wish there were an option for a —🌟rating. 
17542 4 Work just as good as my og canon battery and super cheap. 
17543 4 Takes nice pictures above and below water. Seems like the ones under water are nicer/clearer if the sun is directly above you. For the money you can t beat it. 
17544 4 these are propellers. I used them as such 
17545 4 Awesome 
17546 4 Great. 
17547 4 I m very pleased with our purchase. Camera works with our iOS devices flawlessly! We can monitor our little puppy from most everywhere. I would highly recommend this to family and friends! 
17548 4 Was attempting to take photos of the glorious mountains in our backyard. These lens did the job, though I had to edit with instagram afterwards. 
17549 3 Can t beat the price - bulbs burned out within 2 days - but very pleased with the quality. 
17550 4 I love this large air blaster. It works and works well. I always keep it with my camera and lenses as I use it before any shoot just to be sure that I get the desired impact from my equipment. Compact yet effective. Thanks. 
17551 3 Great when shooting all landscape stills or working with video cameras. Mounting to longer lenses causes some issues when going vertical but a work around is to have your vertical lens on you dominant hand. Good quality material. 
17552 4 we love it!!! 
17553 4 The camera was easy to setup. To access it on the computer remotely on another network was easy and picture quality was great. Even the app worked great on my phone for remotely viewing the camera and allowed for pan and tilt and speaker and mic usage. 
17554 4 Much better fit than the one that came with my lens. The branded original kept falling off and I ended up losing it. This cap is so secure I feel it is safe even though I removed the lanyard. 
17555 3 Works for basic monitoring Does have lots of features too. However many people have complained about interference with garage door transmit and I had same issue when i put it in my garage. So beware. 
17556 4 Super cute and easy to carry around everywhere with me! 
17557 3 Good size float 
17558 4 Love this light. Fit perfect on my canon rebel. Just what I needed 
17559 4 Had an XE1&2 This is a great camera. I do wish the flash could be manually tilted back to bounce the flash like my XE2. Also I love the drive dial! 
17560 3 works well. small enough to put in your pocket 
17561 2 Print very small, not really what I would like to have as a quick reference guide. Need magnifier to even begin to see what they are saying. 
17562 4 Another satisfied grandkid. Super easy to use and takes good pictures. 
17563 1 It doesn t stay on an active dog very well. 
17564 4 This thing has some zooming power, but you need to purchase a tripod to help hold and steady it. Looking forward to getting some moon shots; so I`ll let you know how they turn out. 
17565 4 Great 
17566 4 Excellent! We re very pleased! 
17567 4 great head, very heavy sturdy build as you d expect. just as good as other name brands but 30% cheaper :) so I have a couple of these now and happy with them 
17568 2 It doesn t actually detect my dog. 
17569 0 There is not enough space to tell one how I feel about this product or the company customer service! 
17570 4 good 
17571 4 This is what I needed. 
17572 4 fits good cant wait to try it out. 
17573 1 work hard to make this work 
17574 4 Works perfectly. 
17575 4 Great bag and perfect size! 
17576 4 My cousin is happy with it! He was searching it for a long time. So let s see, how long it s gonna last. 
17577 4 Need to learn all the begins the scenes fearless of this phone but love it! 
17578 4 As with all the other Pelican cases i ve used in the past, this is a top notch product. I use it to store a Nikon D5300, multiple lenses, a portable hard drive, a portable NAS controller, backup battery, nikon battery charger, and memory card case. 
17579 4 For those claiming the cap has poor fit, it took me a bit to figure out as well, but you need to TWIST it on so that it mounts properly after putting it on the barrel. It will snap into place and fits excellent afterward 
17580 4 Small, light weight and perfect for a 180mm or smaller quad. 
17581 4 Very nice quality. 
17582 4 Kept camera from sinking and came in very handy! 
17583 4 Works great. Do wish it had room for a second lens though. 
17584 4 playing with it all the time! 
17585 4 bought one more than a year ago, it has worked so well I got another. once charged, it lasts a long time, about five hours. extremely satisfied with the purchase and the second one was actually cheaper than the first one. 
17586 2 Does the job though the plastic is cheap and tends to chip off. 
17587 2 Difficult to focus 
17588 4 Fits perfectly on my camera screen and doesn t make it blurry to see photos. Very clear and easy to keep clean. 
17589 4 Nice 
17590 4 Fit perfect and strong 
17591 4 Great lens!! 
17592 4 Fast Shipping, product as described. 
17593 4 Quality product for a very reasonable price. 
17594 4 These cases are so amazing. Holds my sniper rifle and a couple pistols with out a problem. It takes a while to cut the foam but it is so worth it in the end. 
17595 4 having lots of fun with this 
17596 4 All the parts you need to make 4 lanyards. Pick your own length. Works great, and easy to make. Just need a hammer and lighter. 
17597 4 such a great, fun camera. I love the the pics it produces. Such a great camera to bring to a party and hand out the pics 
17598 4 Best deal for the amount of accessories in the box. 
17599 4 worked great. forgot my charger on a beach trip used my prime to have this delivered love amazon! 
17600 3 Ideal 
17601 4 Works great for us! Thanks!! 
17602 4 It is just right and came with in a few days of ordering. 
17603 2 Will this work with other lenses or just the 16-50mm? 
17604 0 Cheap and doesn t work right 
17605 2 its a very tricky camera if you are trying to setup wirelessly quality of this night vision camera is great and price is ok too but man its a headache to set it up, it should come with a Advil 
17606 4 Works good. 
17607 4 Best thing ever... 
17608 0 Very cheap quality! Bought 2 and one of my buttons were already broken! Also product heats up very fast so it is a potential fire hazard! Was looking forward to these but on to the next amazon find! 
17609 4 Thank you, it good quality. 
17610 4 Absolutely brilliant little piece of equipment! A must have for astrophotogtahy with an SCT. 
17611 0 I have had the speedlight for about 3 months and the mode button longer works. 
17612 0 Fraud. 
17613 4 Works as expected with no issues 
17614 4 Gave 5 stars because quality was good for price paid. Holds a6000 with no issues and will be perfect for traveling. Little flimsy but if you take care it will work fine and last. 
17615 4 Out of the aftermarket BP-511, these seem to work the best with Canon 50D. 
17616 4 Good price. Good quality. Fast shipping. 
17617 4 it s a good items. 
17618 4 Great product! Easy to transport, set up, and use. I love the lighting I achieve with it indoors and out. I definitely recommend either having an assistant to hold it if you are outdoors or bring sandbags as a 60&#34; umbrella will blow over in the slightest wind. 
17619 4 Great start up kit. 
17620 4 Works perfectly! Very happy with the product. Especially the price. 
17621 0 Don t wast your money - you ll never use it. Way harsh on the orange. 
17622 4 Excellent product , very satisfied with it s function. I recommend this item in a heartbeat. 
17623 4 Clear and crisp photos. Good price! 
17624 4 Great price. Works as promised. No issues at all. I mounted them both behind the 16-50 PZ - no issues! We had a little fun creating a lego dance scene (captured on a Sony a6000) 
17625 4 Got the quadcopter running and after a few dry runs got the hang of it and it runs very well.....I am very happy with it!!!!! 
17626 4 Perfect camera mount for car dash or windshield. Sturdy and strong, very reliable. 
17627 2 If you have 70 yr old eyes as I do you better get real good magnifying glass 
17628 0 These perform as good as if not better than the Canon battery that came with the camera, and at a fraction of the price. UPDATE: Batteries last 1.5 years and then completely died. Took to a camera expert - and said that neither batter was holding any power after charging. 
17629 1 I rarely use the camera and it stays in the camera bag most of the time, however, the jacket started to crack after several months. 
17630 4 Always an excellent product. 
17631 3 This was super easy to set up - the hardest part was finding the button on the camera. Once that was set up, the remote worked instantly. 
17632 4 Perfect!!! 
17633 0 Holes only 4.3mm not the 8mm advertised. I had to return it, would not fit photoflex box rods. 
17634 0 Ok ordere the camera nad htis drop magic together, camera was dropped by amazon 
17635 2 Not too smooth moving it whilr shooting 
17636 3 Extremely sturdy. Love pistol grip 
17637 4 I recently purchased this kit and I am very impressed with the quality of the product! The images are wonderful and the kit is very easy to set up. It is definitely worth the money! 
17638 4 works well. 
17639 4 Great inexpensive, alternative to baby monitors! Great for the price!! 
17640 0 not good Quality.. take too long to arrived 
17641 4 If you need a reliable battery. These are the best out there. They constantly out perform my GoPro branded batteries. They last around an hour and 15 mins of filming and the price is great. Don t overlook these batteries. They are amazing. 
17642 4 Great case. The cube foam works great and gives you a very professional result. Very satisfied. 
17643 4 DEI products are my first choice for security and remote start 
17644 2 Kinda weak ,but ok for price 
17645 4 These batteries last forever. I snagged a spare and have yet to run my primary battery down. 
17646 3 I bought this for a gift for someone and they really like it. Does everything they want to do with a camera. Very good lens apparently. 
17647 4 Fast enough for my 810. 
17648 4 loved it 
17649 3 enjoying 
17650 3 works as needed for little dollars. Don t know how long it will last. 
17651 0 Spend 12 hours won t able to work stay away 
17652 3 does what it s supposed to. 
17653 4 Works perfect. 
17654 4 Perfect. 
17655 4 This product is awesome and works great! The video is very clear and clean, I suggest everybody that wants to spy and look cool get this product!!! Great product SpyCrushers!!! 
17656 4 lets me take picture of different objects without the burden of having difficulties in finding the stable position and exposure. glad to find this camera before our exposure trip in the slums of detroit. 
17657 1 Only half of my purchase works. Somehow one of my light fixtures and a bulb doesn t work. Sending it back. 
17658 4 Perfect, performs the same as the old one. 
17659 4 Works great. Easy to install and use. Great picture and sound quality. Love that there is an app for it. And send notification when any motion is detected. 
17660 2 Thought I was getting new prod this whole order was a disappointment 
17661 3 Battery life is comparable to the OEM battery, however it is a bit snug in my X-T1. It doesn t come out as easily as the OEM battery. I have to pick it out with my fingernails. 
17662 4 Works great. 
17663 4 camera came with 2 batteries and a charger.. but having another is NEVER a bad idea.. especially when this one comes with a car adaptor! charges actually FASTOR than the canon one!! product was delivered on time as well!! very pleased! stays in camera bag 
17664 4 A low cost alternative to Zacuto products, for certain things. 
17665 4 OK, the câmera is very goood!!! 
17666 4 Although i have too many lenses for this case it is perfect for my favorite two. I love the rain protector and how solid the straps feel. I totally trust this case with my most expensive equipment 
17667 2 its ok 
17668 3 Canberra does a good job for the price. Takes great pictures and once I know how to use it better I m sure video and picture quality will a go up. 
17669 3 It has met my expectations. Easy to install but with fact that this was for a new home build and wiring already in place. Very good mobile app that did the job when went out of town just after getting it installed. 
17670 4 I purchase it to extend my LAVIEW camera which works fantastic day and night view is great. 
17671 4 cool toy 
17672 4 I love this camera it has a stablizer which helps me take beautiful pictures!!! 
17673 4 so far works great! 
17674 4 Nice case! 
17675 4 Good camera, only use it a couple of days but it serves our needs very well. 
17676 1 I got missing parts 
17677 4 Very happy with my purchase 
17678 3 The effect in photography is as intended, however the plastic feels much less sturdy than I expected for the price. 
17679 2 does the job, but a little awkward. 
17680 3 Met my expextativas , good near vision 
17681 4 good lens kit from Goja. I am really loving the look of this and set 
17682 3 I got this to charge up and use for a back up on my camera. It appears to have charged well, I haven t had a chance to use it yet! 
17683 4 Great 
17684 4 Great Pics....Manual lenses are the best 
17685 2 Works fine but there is this problematic &#34;feature&#34; that turning it on/off 4x in 4 seconds makes it reset / forget the network. So far my kids have done this twice and it s really annoying. 
17686 4 Arrived as promised. 
17687 4 Great results every time with this film. 
17688 4 Love the metallic blue color! 
17689 4 Love this! Awesome purchase! 
17690 4 THE ONLY ONE THAT I FOUND CAN FIT AmazonBasics 52-Inch Carbon Fiber Travel Tripod.... 
17691 0 Would not work with computer - very dark photos - not easy to use. 
17692 4 strong holding mounts. need some extra mounts for the go pro. these hold up well, used some on the RZR running bumpy tarain and they have stayed mounted. 
17693 4 Great batteries at a fraction of the originals. 
17694 0 These things scratched the crap out of my 2 month old glasses lenses, even with glasses cleaner. Thanks. 
17695 0 Didn t work for long... don t waste money. 
17696 4 Good value. 
17697 4 Lightweight and exactly what I needed for all my gear. 
17698 4 never used a selfie stick before.... Very easy to set up, just charged it, held down the shutter button until it flashed, paired it with the phone, and started using it. It works great! Compatible with all the apps on my phone. The folding design makes it very compact. 
17699 4 Nice value 
17700 1 Pretty much didn t work for me. Too bulky, and i don t like letting my camera dangle by one side. I walk - a lot - when i shoot, and this just forced the camera to bang against me, no matter how i rigged it. 
17701 3 efficient & accurate 
17702 0 Crap 
17703 2 Not a solid yellow case as depicted in the photo. Otherwise a typical quality Pelican case. 
17704 4 Great Buy ! 
17705 4 It s not as heavy as a Pelican case so it s much easier on the back. The case seems exceptionally well designed. It fits the drone perfectly and the storage slots are well thought out. Everything fits perfectly. 
17706 3 Great product! 
17707 4 i have this product and I definitely recommend it. i can see my kids whenever wherever i want. totally worth the price 
17708 4 good 
17709 4 Excellent fit and was amazed that once installed my screen actually looked brighter and clearer. 
17710 0 Could not get it to work properly and couldn t get the lighting adjusted. I ve never had this much trouble with a digital camera. It wound up going in the trashcan. :-( 
17711 0 Broke the first time I used it on a motocross bike and lost my friend s GoPro that I borrowed for a shoot. Spent hours looking and had to buy her a new one. So this piece of junk actually cost $400. 
17712 4 Extremely good value. 
17713 3 didnt work for me but quality looks good 
17714 4 We love it! 
17715 4 Great camera, good price 
17716 4 Great product, highly recommended 
17717 3 Perfect pictures but SONY colors are nicer. 
17718 4 love it love it, pictures are very clear easy to carry around 
17719 4 Great bag for the price! 
17720 0 This kit is the worst. No instructions, just a mess of products most of which I have no idea how to connect or what they do. No instructions 
17721 4 Good!! 
17722 4 Work for the camera I purchased them for 
17723 4 A little pricy but worth it 
17724 4 nice bag 
17725 4 Works very well, easy to attach and take off, simple lil mirror accurately helps set up the shot 
17726 4 great deal 
17727 4 Just fine. Camera works now 
17728 4 All parts are quality, love the package! love the price! 
17729 4 Excellent 
17730 4 Original item, functions perfectly! 
17731 2 I have mix feelings about this. Thought about returning it but decided to keep it. The selfie stick is extremely short. Everything is just cheap quality but gets the job done. The case is probably the best thing about the kit. 
17732 2 not bad it is very usufull 
17733 3 Sometime it didn t adhere to camera... 
17734 4 Great light. It is plenty bright and can be dimmed. Also, like that it comes with a battery that can be used in your GoPro. Fits perfect to the camera. Would recommend. 
17735 4 I never want to take this lens off of my camera. It s so sharp and focuses faster than my Canon 50mm 1.4. The lens distortion is minimal. Love it. 
17736 4 very good 
17737 4 I am very impressed with this lens. It is very sharp and the Bokeh is out of this world. My portrait business just went up a notch. 
17738 4 These work great! I like the cell phone screen cleaner it works pretty good too! 
17739 4 Excellent 
17740 4 As advertised 
17741 4 working great,no problem 
17742 4 These batteries work just fine they power my digital canon camera just as they are supposed to do. 
17743 4 Great camera--so pleased with it. 
17744 4 A big help in keeping a full bag of gear on your shoulder. Highly recommend. 
17745 4 really surprising 
17746 4 Works awesome, camera see s this device as a Nikon product. Its built well and all functions work flawlessly 
17747 1 Great affordable product, but the software is quite glitch. You often need to close the software, shut down the FLIR device, turn it back on, and load the software back up. Or else it d be a 5 star. 
17748 4 Great easily charges batteries. highly recommend 
17749 4 Easy to adjust and use, good quality. Great for hiking, etc. Good solution when you need a quality product but don t want to pay a small fortune for an item that will only be used on an occasional basis. basis. 
17750 4 Quality is great, no complaints so far. I use them for wiring outdoor camera s and they have held up to direct, hot sunlight as well as rain and moisture without any deterioration. 
17751 4 Works great for going through hundreds of slides. Great sellers 
17752 3 Purchased a couple of these for kids going off to school. One of them was defective and the owner promptly replaced it (thank you!) They work as intended - pull the cord and it goes off. I just hope my kids never have a need to use it. 
17753 0 I have an 8&#34; Dobsonian Zhumell. I have used this time of camera eye piece previously. Could not get it to focus at all with this purchase. Tech support suggested that I move the main mirror. Back in the box for a refund. 
17754 4 very good product 
17755 4 Awesome camera. I bought this for my wife for her birthday. My oldest son played with it and ended up buying one for himself he liked it so much. 
17756 4 High quality A/V stick. Works well with Saumsung S5, Iphone 6 and Hero 4. I was able to use the stick with a Hero4 in air flight going around 100 mph and the device worked flawlessly. No turns or twists like the cheap sticks. 
17757 4 For the price, which was very reasonable, it is a great charger. Seems solidly built. Of course, I ve only used it once so far. I had a charger of similar size, brand X, which was pretty flimsy and stopped working after a while. 
17758 3 Very handy, and just the right size! 
17759 3 Is great and is the best mini camcorder ever 
17760 3 Easy to use, good quality. 
17761 4 Got these as a gag gift for my brother who is a photographer, but he actually loves them and uses them often. 
17762 0 Uh it ended up not working but I was sick of trying to figure out how to work with the files AND the camera itself. Bad product for me. 
17763 4 Everything was exactly as advertised and well packaged. My son loves the camera. Great value package!!! 
17764 3 works wonderfully my first photo backdrop stand would buy again would recommend to others 
17765 4 Great value and always handy to have extra power for my go pro on hand. 
17766 4 Works great. Planning to use it for remote live video of a baptism. Can t wait to see how it all turns out. 
17767 0 This was a gift. 
17768 4 good buy 
17769 3 It fit and work as described in the add. It is working great 
17770 4 Jonathan Reed from foscam tech support did a fantastic job helping set up my camera 
17771 4 looks cool 
17772 4 Great bag, for a great price! Fits both my camera bodies, lenses and flash. It s much easier to transport my equipment in a backpack. 
17773 3 Created a new quadcopter from an old quadcopter using this and some new blades. The frame is stuff and solid, odds are that it ll break the first time it falls out of the air (but we won t let that happen). 
17774 0 It doesn t Work 
17775 4 Wow fit perfect 
17776 4 excellent product. deliveried on time as was promised. 
17777 4 Great 
17778 4 This is perfect to keep my zip from just being banged around in my bag. 
17779 4 Works great! Awesome value for the money! Does exactly what I need for 1/4th the price! 
17780 3 Good quality for the price. 
17781 4 Great little camera...no problems so far!! 
17782 4 hard to find yet you had in stock at a low price. I am impressed 
17783 4 The charger works perfectly and the delivery was extremely fast. I highly recommend this product! 
17784 2 Not meant to be on a supervised system, no &#34;in / out&#34; leads. 
17785 4 i have LOVED using this instant camera. its fun & vintage! takes great shots. even my 3 year old loves using it. we display the photos on our fridge and in an instant film sized album. 
17786 2 The optics aren t great but I guess you get what you are willing to pay for. At this point I think I would have spent a little more to get one that will last longer and have better optics. 
17787 3 It is good. 
17788 4 I am sure it works well, but I couldn t use it. I thought I only broke the lens but turns out I completely destroyed the camera. Giving it 5 stars because I can t justify otherwise, but I did not actually use it. 
17789 4 The bag is very beautiful 
17790 4 The batteries are very good !!! The charger is very slow, but they give you the charger like a bonus !!! 
17791 3 Excelent 
17792 4 these are TOUGH 
17793 4 Kenneth at Foscam service did a great job walking me through the setup. The Foscam works perfect and looks great! I would recommend Foscam because of the ease and customer service. 
17794 4 Just what I needed to help in the digitizing of my slides ... saved time sorting what should/should not be saved. 
17795 4 Works perfectly!!! 
17796 4 Item shipped fast and was as described. 
17797 4 Works fine. 
17798 4 Henry did an excellent job of support. It is the first time the ipad has connected to my foscam camera. I also now know what to do to access from a remote location. THANK YOU HENRY. 
17799 4 Illuminati. 
17800 4 Works great! High quality! 
17801 4 Excellent 
17802 4 This was my first time placing a order with amazon, very pleased and will be ordering again soon. 
17803 0 Does not auto focus on a D3200. 
17804 4 Works extremely well. 
17805 4 Henry has been very helpful in setting up all my Foscam Cameras. Great tech support! 
17806 4 Lost my charger while on vacation , got this because it came with a battery for my camera as a bonus. Works well and haven t had any issues so far (2 months). Battery doesn t last as long as oem but it does have the smart info. 
17807 4 A set of standard cold cathode tubes with all required hardware to mount in a computer. I use these for interior lighting in my car as well. 
17808 4 Easy set up instructions! Took me 10minutes to set up and that was mostly due to the fact that I forgot my home wifi password. The quality in picture both day and night vision are very clear! I am so happy with this purchase! 
17809 4 I ve enjoyed these filters immensely. They ve been a huge help on my sunset and landscape photography. 
17810 4 Just what I needed 
17811 0 Battery only hold half the charge time as an actual Sony Battery. Good for emergency backup but no way would I use this as a first line battery. Very disappointed.... 
17812 4 Good service and product. 
17813 4 Nice set. Works great.. I d get it again. 
17814 4 Great package - great camera - service was very responsive. 
17815 0 Not my favirate a replaced this one with a much better that also holds my wifi remote. 
17816 4 works great for easy close up shots and much cheaper then buying a macro lens just for a few fun shots 
17817 4 Excellent, Love it 
17818 0 It never worked even once, and the company refused to suggest a repair. 
17819 4 This is my first drone and I must say am truly enjoying this. 
17820 3 Work good didn t have any problem 
17821 2 Okay product 
17822 4 Love it and easy to use which is a must for me! 
17823 4 Good buy and it s light and nice 
17824 2 All in all it s ok. The pin in oddly rounded and makes for an ill fit for a lot of lights. The tensioners are plastic. 
17825 4 Works beautifully for the EF-S lenses whose focus rotates the lense, ruling out the use of a petal hood. Best features are the accordion collapsibility for wider angles or storage. Being rubber it does prevent the end of the lens from some knocks against walls and such. 
17826 4 Good 
17827 3 Very pleased so far with the package. I really like the adjustable screen position. 
17828 4 Great product. 
17829 4 Really expensive to use, but totally worth it 
17830 1 I was under the impression that they would have sand inside of them. Needed them for a last minute fashion photo shoot, but since they weren t full, they were useless to me. The quality seems decent though, but since they come without sand I think they should be cheaper. 
17831 4 Just what I needed for my GE X600 
17832 4 This is a lovely camera i m learning how to use it,other than that it takes beautiful pictures. And oh delivery was so quick 
17833 4 Awesome lens. Gives a much larger view with minor distortion. 
17834 1 Caution: Does not fit iPhone6 Plus. I had to modify it. 
17835 4 absolutely love my Polaroid! easy to use and small enough to carry around! although the Polaroid can easily get scuff marks on. the best way to use the Polaroid is by watching a video on how to use so every picture will come out great! 
17836 4 Great product. Very sharp display. I increased the saturation and contrast slightly, but very pleased. Initially had a problem, but realized I had a corrupted file, and as soon as I fixed that, it worked great. 
17837 4 works great 
17838 4 Really nice construction. Quality product. 
17839 4 This unit is priceless. Nice and compact and does the job. 
17840 3 these cameras need SOMETHING for bright sun. This helps, but I d rather have a viewfinder. Don t like that it uses adhesive, but can t think of another way to do it. 
17841 4 Excellent.. Super easy to install!!! 
17842 4 A great charger 
17843 3 Very powerful despite its size. 
17844 4 Great deal 
17845 4 This is a great size to put my camera. I could put a Sony a6000, Sony Carl Zeiss 16-70mm lens, and have enough room for storage with a Goal Zero charging stick. 
17846 4 Thank 
17847 0 AVOID, especially from this seller. Mine won t turn on and the seller won t take it back. Thanks for the $300 paper weight! 
17848 2 it would be nicer if it had some sort of timing feature 
17849 4 Great! I love it! 
17850 4 Great so far - does what it s supposed to at a great price and I haven t noticed anything awry so far... 
17851 4 I cannot tell if cases were &#34;used&#34; as they said because they look brand new! Highly recommended! 
17852 4 AWESOME 
17853 4 Worked well 
17854 4 Works perfectly with no degradation of quality. 
17855 3 product as expected, delivered on time 
17856 4 works perfect. Great fit and finish. 
17857 4 Very nice and high quality 
17858 4 For the price nice piece of gear. 
17859 4 Great Flashes at a Great Price.. 
17860 0 dont buy this it s trush work fine at the start few days later less then 1 week it not working it s junk 
17861 4 I use this with my Microsoft LifeCam and it works great!! Definitely worth the money!! 
17862 0 two months after installation the hard-drive stop working, can t get help from Zmodo, email only support. I do not recommend this system, poor quality and no service. 
17863 4 nice chair, works great 
17864 4 A great tool to take your pic s very well made. Thanks very much 
17865 4 perfect. easy. durable. 
17866 4 Very good and faster 
17867 2 Was very disappointed because the Coolpix came with only a user s manual written in Arabic and couldn t find instructions or manual online. 
17868 0 DO NOT BUY. Hard to install. Tech support is a joke. Returned. Do not buy. It s a POS. 
17869 1 I have not figured out how to get it to work TTL. Must be me, however I used to be in the camera business. This flash/camera combo has me perplexed. 
17870 4 Received when promised. Good quality product. Will be buying more. 
17871 4 This lens has been wonderful at teaching me about depth of field. I m still learning of course!! I love the look of my youtube videos when using it and the look of my photos. The price was excellent for me as a beginner. 
17872 4 worked as advertised. Full charge within a short time...replaced original. 
17873 4 This lens is what I expected it to be..It s well made and offers a more graduated transfer from ND to UV that most others don t offer... 
17874 4 Perfect for small trail cameras. 
17875 4 Great system and service!!! 
17876 2 The cameras are good but they are not wireless.Thats why I gave 3 starzs!!!If they were wireless I would give camera system 5 starzs.The setup is very easy... 
17877 4 You can t go wrong with these cases. They ll last a lifetime. 
17878 4 The Mount works perfectly. Sticks like glue to the windshield. 
17879 4 It was a good purchase 
17880 3 So far, these batteries appear to last as long as the original. Most important, the Panasonic FZ1000, for which these batteries were ordered, absolutely consumes battery power so quickly, a couple of extra batteries from DOT-01 are necessary! 
17881 4 versatile, compact, easy to use, excellent picture quality. 
17882 4 Really handy accessory for the point & shoot cameras. This is my 5th or 6th one (I keep giving them to folks who have not seen one before). 
17883 4 sturdy! 
17884 3 Used the batteries on my sony action cam and it works great. So much better than buying at the store for a lot more. 
17885 0 Hard to connect. Wish I sent it back before it was to late. 
17886 4 Snapped right into place on my Nikon D90. Same as original eye cup. 
17887 4 Awesome, loads of fun to fly. 
17888 4 Perfect for one big lens and one small lens 
17889 4 It s really light, easy to fold and unfold, sturdy, and all: the seating area, the size when folded and the height of the stool are just perfect for my husband and me (weight 240 lb.) I will buy another. 
17890 0 Could not get a response back from the supplier. The motion sensing does not work well at all. I would not recommend this product if motion sensing is what you want. Also apparently there is no support from the supplier so I suggest finding a different supplier too. 
17891 4 I bought this lens primarily to shoot high school football, and it does a fantastic job! Built like a tank, operates very smoothly, and has great optics. You can t beat the Canon L glass! 
17892 3 Slider works well. The screws for the feet were sized incorrectly. I replaced with my own screws, works fine! 
17893 4 Great value, good lense for close up/portrait 
17894 0 WILL NEVER WORK NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. A REAL PIECE OF GARBAGE. 
17895 4 These batteries are a screaming deal. I have the two pack plus the original for my K-3. I am pretty sure that they last longer than the stock battery that came with my camera. Don t hesitate to purchase these for whatever camera system you use. 
17896 4 Great product, no issue at all. 
17897 4 Changed the way I shoot iphone footage. Takes a little bit to get the hang of it but the difference between with and without are staggering. Can t wait to try it with my GoPro.. 
17898 4 AAA 
17899 0 My glasses broke after the second day. The ear piece dosent work and broke inside of the glasses. What do I do about this? 
17900 4 Exactly as posted. Thanks! 
17901 4 Absolutely, it came complete with battery-charger and cable. It would have cost me close to $50.00 to get these items on line from Panasonic. 
17902 4 like the way this ride on the side of the body... a true neck saver! 
17903 4 this works GREAT! I was shocked that it cost so little! Wish I had it sooner! 
17904 4 One of the best low budget cameras. Super cool pictures and the display is really awesome. Only thing is the delay while taking the snap which I don t worry about. Excellent 5 start. 
17905 3 Flishing is fine but does not include any len cap 
17906 4 Got this for my daughter, she loves it. Works as it should, 50 count, and shipping was fast! 
17907 4 I use these for both the Nikon Remote and for spare SDCards ! I use 2 of these one in each camera strap ! Very useful little item ! 
17908 4 Easy to install. take me for less 5 minutes to completed. The camera look good with the blinking red light. I love it, it perfect. Hopefully nobody messup my front yard. 
17909 4 Works well. I use it on my bicycle. It grip well and it adjusts well. 
17910 4 All good, no issues 
17911 2 This item could stay connected it would be awesome. as soon as it says the download is starting it disconnects and the download is canceled. currently it just hangs on my camera strap but it dosen t work. 
17912 2 I didn t realized it had no hard drive so I cannot record. 
17913 4 These come in really handy, because sometimes your oe battery will run down and as soon as it does you just pop one of these in and continue recording. 
17914 4 Love my camera just what I expected 
17915 4 Great product! 
17916 4 Just right and beautiful. I bought these lens protector filters alongside my canon 24mm -105mm lens. The quality is unbelievable and well built. I truly recommend this product to anyone who wants to buy a good quality lens filter on a limited budget. 
17917 4 I love this thing. I can fit everything in there, except a mini tripod (gorillapod) and my larger RAM mount attachments/arms. Really nice to have everything in one package. 
17918 4 Ricahrd did a great job of helping me get this set up Great product and great price 
17919 3 Great product. Is working flawlessly. I only wish there was an option to turn off the in-mirror display. It is fine with it on, and doesn t really mess with your ability to use the mirror, just a personal preference. 
17920 4 It is everything that it said it was. Plenty of room for all of my daughters equiptment 
17921 4 great camera, great value 
17922 4 Fits the camera well. All buttons can be used while in the case. 
17923 4 Very good product 
17924 1 Does not work with the GoPro which i bought it for but it does work OK with my Nikon 
17925 4 great solver for battery = ) 
17926 4 Great 
17927 4 liked very much 
17928 3 As advertised. 
17929 4 Excellent quality /price ratio 
17930 4 Now he has a second battery and can keep shooting. 
17931 4 For the price this is really great. I needed it so I could get family portrait shots and I have used it a bunch of times successfully. It is WAY cheaper than other ones. 
17932 4 Incredibly solid and sturdy unit comparable to ones costing significantly more. Very good adjustment features. Holds an 80mm Kowa spotting scope at various heights and positions without a problem. A great buy at twice this price. 
17933 4 This is great way to use my camera now I can connect to my computer in the field without wires running everywhere. 
17934 2 I was expecting the body to made of metal like other cameras I have that were like it 
17935 4 Its the perfect accessory to protect your lense. A must if you own this camera. 
17936 0 Poor product. Easily comes off strap, does not hold cap well. I threw it away. No way to fix it except design a totally new product. 
17937 4 I got this for my granddaughter s 14th birthday and she just loves it. She told me it takes great pictures. I highly recommend this camera plus you can t beat the since it includes so much more than just the camera. 
17938 4 Bought extra cameras to synch in with a previous purchased unit. Works great! 
17939 3 Good product. Holds GoPro really good. 
17940 0 If you are looking for a floating handle...do not buy this as it definitely does not float!! 
17941 4 Works fine in our Olympus Pen PL-7. 
17942 2 These battery replacements were just ok, for me. I have found them to lose their charge more quickly than my 2 year old original Nikon battery. 
17943 2 Not the easiest to use but takes quality photos. 
17944 4 Excellent piece of kit, I was looking for a decent frame mount so the head strap was a bonus. 
17945 4 Great camera 
17946 1 Too much noise. 
17947 4 Great little kit for my Nikon D3100. Nice quality filters and accessories. I have purchased from this company before because they have good products. Super fast delivery too. 
17948 4 Perfect, exactly what I needed. The cover is cardboard with a thick plastic slip over it. The inside pockets do not stick to photos thank goodness!! 
17949 4 Great product 
17950 4 Whenever I purchase a camera the first thing I do is attach a clear filter for lens protection. B+W is the best out there on the market. Their quality control is stellar. 
17951 4 Great Product. works well. 
17952 0 I purchased two of them and they both ran *extremely* hot. Hot enough that you couldn t even touch it for more than a few seconds. 
17953 4 Perfect for GoPro. Same quality as name brand. 
17954 4 I Love them. 
17955 4 Product is exactly as the same as described, easy installation, good quality video pictures and a must-have for home security!!! 
17956 4 Good 
17957 4 Made in the Japan!!! This product came all the way from Japan and it is the perfect fit for my camera!!! 
17958 3 i like it ! 
17959 3 Worked as expected. Very fast charging 
17960 3 Installed it on my PVS-14, works great for the money 
17961 4 This Canon EF 28mm F/1.8 Wide Angle Lens has made such an improvement in my photography. Now I am getting more wide range images especially with mountain landscape shots. I am very pleased with the product. Canon is a favored product at my house. Highly recommend both! 
17962 0 While the image quality is excellent, the audio quality is really poor. 
17963 1 Only one battery was any good and tripod broke on first use. The other battery was swelled and would not fit in camera. Lenses work great though. 
17964 3 Can not claim to have a lot of experience withthe camera yet, but ran out of battery firt time using it...-yes it was fully charged, and yes you can buy extra battery capacity, but this should be standard. 
17965 4 Great unit for the GoPro - I attached it and forgot about it. 
17966 4 Happy with gift 
17967 4 Everything is OK. Good quality product as described in the announcement. Thank you! 
17968 4 Nice pack. A touch short for a D810 with an 80-40-- but its manageable. 
17969 4 It is such a cute and functional little bag. I just adore it! 
17970 0 I bought this for my daughter and it never worked. 
17971 4 Works in my camera just fine. Priced right! 
17972 4 Works great; It is delicate however. If you are a &#34;masher&#34;... well you know...buy a kodak 
17973 0 it is written on the box, IP Camera &#34;Internet Security Camera&#34; and it only works in the same network. That s a joke! 
17974 3 Lots of storage areas, hold camera and lenses tight and secure. Plenty of room for additional equipment. 
17975 4 These cables worked fine. Connectors matched. Video and power seems to both be good over the cable. 
17976 4 This is big enough to hold my camera and all my accessories safely. I love it. 
17977 4 Provides quick convenient protection against bumps, scrapes, condensation and dust when carrying a camera outdoors in cold windy situations or when my camera is thrown into a loose bag or back pak. 
17978 4 Woks very nicely to steady hi power binoculars. 
17979 4 Excellent product. Light and easy to carry and very useful 
17980 4 Arrived on time and as described 
17981 3 Fit and finish: good to excellent. Battery tray sometimes unclips from the charger, but appears to be quite robust. Gets a little warm for my liking, but not as warm as the supplied charger for my iPhone. Quite happy with the purchase. 
17982 4 Works better than described. Lights everything amazingly. 
17983 4 Good picture. Fairly easy to set up. 
17984 4 fits perfect works well 
17985 4 excellent, met my expectations! 
17986 4 The setup was some what of a pain to get online with my secured router. I have been using it for months now and it shows great reliability and app works great. Great purchase for the money! 
17987 2 It fits but falls easy when underwater 
17988 2 Nice camera add-on, but extremely difficult to remove from the camera once attached. 
17989 4 Looks like a photo on smooth material, pretty heavy duty. 
17990 4 great transaction. Product as described 
17991 4 Works great. 
17992 4 This camera is awesome! Takes the best pictures and it s simple to use. 
17993 4 perfect little lens. 
17994 3 It has solved my main purpose of connecting my lense with the desired body. Only due to it s inability to connect with the circuit of the body, many functions like Focus Point, AF etc are not working. But you can use it if you are expert in manual functions. 
17995 4 what I wanted 
17996 4 Great camera 
17997 4 What an amazing camera 
17998 4 works like it should 
17999 4 I love it! 
18000 4 Just what I was looking for. Much easier then the earlier versions. Definitely more cost effective since it came standard with the LCD display. 
18001 4 Superfast shipping. I love the camera. 
18002 3 Works great. Would not stay submerged on it s own and did not allow a drop of water into the case. 
18003 2 From the description I was expecting two. This isn t worth the price for only one. 
18004 4 excellent product. 
18005 4 Great lens. Awesome upgrade from the 18-55 Nikon lens. Very impressed with the colours and quality. 
18006 4 Great product 
18007 4 Good and fast shippinging 
18008 4 Works great.. 
18009 3 It s a good filter. I did have to clean it as there was some sort of film all over the lens when it arrived. Luckily it leaned up well. 
18010 4 It does what it has to do. So far it have endured cold weather and a lot of adventure. 
18011 0 Poor picture quality, slow 
18012 4 This floaty is awesome!! Make sure you do not use a selfie stick with it because it will sink, otherwise it worked great in the water! 
18013 4 Perfect fit for my Sony DSCHX90V/B! 
18014 4 Easy to hook up. Great quality picture. 
18015 4 Just as shown 
18016 4 very good. keeping the smudges out of my camera lens 
18017 3 It is great for the things I want to use it for thank you 
18018 3 great product 
18019 0 Terrible, Go Pro hit the water and the Velcro separated.........Go Pro is now at the bottom of the lake!! 
18020 4 Used this wakeboarding, hiking, snowboarding, and around the neighborhood. Great length, I really don t need more than the 40&#34; extension. Vey sturdy, no flex in the pole when it s fully extended. 
18021 2 No issues with the camera however it is not supported by Hikvision USA since it is not North American version. Called them for support on their NVR and they refused to help once they saw where the cameras were from.... 
18022 4 Excellent 
18023 4 great! 
18024 0 ONLY LAST CHARGE FOR 2 MONTHS JUNK. AND WILL NOT KEEP A CHARGE. I GOT A NEW BRAND 
18025 0 bad 
18026 0 not user friendly 
18027 4 Ended up not needing this order. But it was exactly what I would have needed. 
18028 2 I never knew i needed to measure light, but damn my photos have improved dramatically, post production time has been cut in half. Overall works well, but the build quality is a bit flimsy for the price. 
18029 0 Not worth spending money for this seller or product company. Its totally a garbage item lying in my house .And its of no use 
18030 3 The fit is fine. I have yet to use them, you will be bugged for a review every few days until you fill one out. 
18031 4 It fit on my Nikon J1 camera easily! It comes packaged in small transparent bag that easily opens without ripping. 
18032 4 Works well the the camera where some extension needed 
18033 3 Great items to have. 
18034 2 some reason it becomes hard to connect to other than thru android 
18035 0 Product failed after about 3 months of VERY LIGHT use not an electronically robust product. Unable to return to seller since it s past 30days After just a few shoots - it started to smoke. Faulty capacitors overheated and melted. A FIRE HAZZARD DO NOT BUY 
18036 4 I used for 3 years now and still going strong! 
18037 3 A set of 4 lenses that can be stacked to achieve some amazing macro results. The set is compact and carries easily in the case which is included. 
18038 4 Does exactly what it is supposed to. Highly recommended. 
18039 4 Excellent bag; roomy, sturdy enough to pack camera, lenses, and overnight gear. 
18040 3 Good quality, great price 
18041 4 this quad is my second best of 11 quads that I have 
18042 4 Great frame, very easy to use and setup 
18043 3 Arrive on time. In good condition. Working as should with camera. Very please. 
18044 4 lens hood was just as stated perfect fit no problems. 
18045 2 The mount that came with it was not the one pictured. It isn t the mount I wanted or was expecting. The mount that I received is for a bike not a shotgun. 
18046 4 good battery 
18047 4 Love this film! 
18048 4 These are amazing. Big capacity and long life. So worth the money and I highly recommend this item. 
18049 4 I use it all the time, no problems. 
18050 4 Outstanding battery and seller!!! 
18051 1 This is a little bit hard. 
18052 4 Added an extra one of these transceivers to my kit that came with the controller. It works great with Canon and Yongnuo flash units. No issues so far. 
18053 4 Love this drone! 
18054 4 Exactly what I needed. Exactly what was advertised. 
18055 0 One of the zipper-pulls on the main compartment of the bag snapped the first time I used it. The bag appeared to be functional and well-built apart from the zipper issue. It does have a nice rain cover and comfortable straps, but because of the zipper issue, I returned it. 
18056 0 The worst assembly instructions ever. They should try out one together using their instructions - not possible. The instructions are flat in wrong order and confusing. 
18057 4 Really good item 
18058 3 I feel like a professional. 
18059 0 Don t bother. Don t know what I expected for the money. Fish eye is exactly that everything looks barreled, the other lens combination does absolutely nothing. Very strange. Packaging was probably worth more than the lens. 
18060 4 Just wanted to say that this thing is awesome 
18061 4 These cameras are great. 
18062 4 THEY LAST SO LONG!! 
18063 4 High Quality and great price! 
18064 3 Tried it once received & it s very good. The packing is also very good. 
18065 4 This stand works great. I used it with a muslin backdrop for the first time yesterday. Although the poles were labeled with the wrong letters it was pretty easy to assemble. 
18066 0 Doesn t work with Sony Nex 5 LT as description said. Waste of money 
18067 4 Bought 2 of these. As long as your router can keep up, these cameras are awesome. Setup was so simple! 
18068 4 battery is good 
18069 4 Awesome !!!!!!! 
18070 3 Okay 
18071 2 it was ok 
18072 2 Case is awesome but I m missing the padding that was suppose to come with it 
18073 4 Works without a problem. 
18074 4 it works. 
18075 4 Very Nice 
18076 4 While these items are not the quality of OEM lens caps, they are very good quality and given the price the value is amazing. I am completely pleased with the product and would definitely buy again -- and definitely before buys an over-priced OEM product. Great job guys! 
18077 4 well-crafted 
18078 4 Pretty good 
18079 4 Nice size. Good quality. Easy to use. 
18080 4 Arrived super fast and fit perfectly. 
18081 4 Awesome lens... but you already know this. 
18082 3 clamps work wonderfully used to hold photo backdrop tight 
18083 4 Price vs quality and performance I haven t seen a better PoE camera 
18084 3 Nice product. very water proof. Does interfere with the auto focus a little 
18085 4 Lots of pieces for a good price. My only grievance is that there was no instructions. The pieces should have a least been labeled. 
18086 4 It s a good switch for automating on/off. Just make sure you have access to the RadioRA 2 software beforehand. 
18087 4 Don t know how I lived without it. 
18088 1 way too small for canon t2i 
18089 0 Awful. Won t fit in my T3i. 
18090 4 Great deal!!! 
18091 3 There were only the barest of instructions included with the camera. To learn how to operate it, you must download an 85 page instruction book. I find that very inconvenient. 
18092 3 it was OK 
18093 3 If summed up in one word, it is a short board camera. I the deepest impression of it is his top focus system, the menu focusing system option is only up to a lot of pages, for its predecessors, is definitely a big improvement corners. 
18094 4 Yup just buy it you won t regret it 
18095 2 Water gets stuck inside and takes forever to get it out. One more downside is the camera cannot be tilted 180° (upside down). 
18096 4 it s very good. the condition of the product is good. there is no scatch and no used. 
18097 4 Battery works just as my real canon battery! Love it and great charge. 
18098 4 love it 
18099 4 Works great......thanks 
18100 4 LOVE this. My camera charger access quit working and now I can recharge the batteries with NO trouble! Got a spare battery to keep on hand, too. Love my camera and didn t want to replace it. 
18101 4 Love these backdrops. Lot of fun to use. 
18102 4 It works perfectly, straps around my wrist comfortably was great for vacationing, water sports, stays on tight - drys out fast. Well made and makes the go pro easy to find in mucky waters of for any reason it ever fell off. Very happy I got this 
18103 4 great deal, we use the camera all the time, saves jacking around with a cell phone, pix are exceptional, camera easy to use. 
18104 3 Up close pictures are kind of fuzzy. 
18105 0 not work well. lost my gopro.a big loss. not good shopping exprience 
18106 4 Love this! Will use with the umbrella light kit for photo booth. Will order another one soon. 
18107 4 Brilliant little well stocked kit, I might recommend picking up the cleaning solution if only to save on another order. But i ve already made great use of the pieces in this kit. 
18108 4 Handy. Compact. My new traveling tripod! Thanks! 
18109 2 Works well as a relatively affordably little light modifying system but I definitely don t think it s up to commercial lighting standards. For me it just works well for impromptu events/gatherings. Good bonus is that it is portable. 
18110 4 No comments 
18111 4 VERY nice camera bag!!! 
18112 4 Our Studio is 100% manfrotto and these plates are a new addition that work so well! Wether you have the traditional 577 plate or the new &#34;long ones,&#34; this will integrate into your system perfectly. 
18113 3 Simple, rapido, buen servicio, y excelentes tutorias. simple, fast, good service, and excellent tutorials. 
18114 4 The batteries work well and the charger is a small size - good for travel. Just remember to push the battery to the right to remove it form the charger. 
18115 4 Better than the part it was bought to replace 
18116 4 I love it 
18117 4 Works fine as long as I have a 37mm lens on the camera. Which is the lens I use most. 
18118 4 Very good 
18119 2 Doesn t shoot well in low light, but you get what you pay for. 
18120 3 Good value for product bundle versus price. Batteries work well. 
18121 0 Does not work for the Sony A-6000 camera (doesn t physically insert into the Sony). Unfair to give it a low rating for that, since they don t claim it will, but the compatible list has several Sony cameras they I thought were similar. Dummy me. 
18122 0 I received this camera yesterday. I have not been able to set it up. The directions stink, the video gives the same info as the instruction book if not less. My Galaxy wont pick up the camera. Cant seem to find a phone number to call for assistance. Not happy. 
18123 4 These work so well and they are perfect. I am new to photography and these are much less than the Canon brand. 
18124 1 It s ok I was expecting the whole thing lit up 
18125 4 I love it. 
18126 4 I put this on a model rocket and the videos it has captured are great! 
18127 4 Comes with every accessory and has a great video quality, I use it mainly for offroading and shooting competitions and it works perfect, the belt clip accessory clips perfectly to the strap of a hat for a perfect first person point of view 
18128 3 works wee. 
18129 4 Just a cable - works fine.. No issues 
18130 4 Love the camera. This is my first deviation from the point and shoot. Great deal for the money. Everything is in excellent condition. 
18131 4 This was a gift for my daughter. It was shipped in a timely manner and at a great price. Everything was as described. She has loved it. 
18132 4 works fine with my Nikon Coolpix S01. 
18133 3 Genuine Canon LP-E6N Battery. I don t trust cheap third party batteries for my 5d Mark III camera. One star off because its Made In China.. 
18134 3 Excellent equipment for a great price! 
18135 3 This is the second one of these I purchased. It is very well made, and I love the bag, but geez, I wish it were a bit larger to carry all of the accessories todays cameras come with --- and the reason for the 4 star rating. 
18136 2 Very good 
18137 4 Excellent tripod. High quality. Shipped very fast. Highly recommended 
18138 4 Fast delivery, items as advertised 
18139 4 [[VIDEOID:58d2b7f2a34eb0053781a1de8164886d]]Great camera for the money. 
18140 4 Best extended battery than the gopro one. 
18141 4 Love this camera, nice image, really easy to use App, easy installation. 
18142 4 once installed works like a charm 
18143 3 A great case and does exactly what I need it to do. My only complaint is for the SD cards the slots are a bit loose and I have to be careful when opening it. 
18144 4 Fits perfectly. 
18145 2 It s more bulky than I thought it would be. It s really for full-size DSLR, so if you have Sony NEX lines, don t get this. 
18146 3 Fit camera nicely, A little snug which made it slightly difficult to release. 
18147 4 Works Great! Easy to assemble and disassemble, sturdy, and adjusts easily. Having the quick release is very handy, though I ve had tripods that are quicker, this one seems to stay still better. Overall worth it. Oh, and it come with a bag! 
18148 4 It worked out really well, I needed something to hold plans for an airplane I m building and it held every page in a well protected plastic sleeve with plenty of additional sheets for Engineering Changes, notes etc. would definitely recommend. 
18149 4 excellent 
18150 4 Needed a back up battery for my canon and so I order this. It came in a in the mail fast and works perfectly! 
18151 2 It helped. Bright reflections around water. I understand that is a big test. 
18152 4 Fit perfectly on my D800 and much clearer than the original. Recently opened my camera bag and found the protector damaged badly. Took it out and suprisantly found my camera screen still in tact, not a scratch. Buying another one to replace right now. Highly recommended. 
18153 4 Good value and works very well. 
18154 3 great product. GOPro works well with this 
18155 4 I use this with my Canon 1.8 50mm prime and it works great.. it s obviously not going to be as good a legit macro lens, however it s fantastic when you consider the abilities this $20 metal tube. Would recommend. 
18156 0 A TOTAL RIPOFF! Batteries will not haold a charge. Cannot get 10 pictures per charge. 
18157 4 A great little camera for the money. Bought it as refurbished, but looks and works like new. Canon makes a great camera. 
18158 4 It worked as advertised and the price was very good. 
18159 4 This works perfectly with my Phantom 2 that I have Fatshark goggles installed on. It is nice to have another monitor for other people to watch or sometimes it is just easier to fly without the FPV goggles. 
18160 4 Works great thks! 
18161 4 just what the Doctor ordered 
18162 4 A gift for my son, he says it is great... 
18163 1 Didn t have all the film !!! 
18164 4 good 
18165 4 Works well. 
18166 0 I received a tripod with a defective ball head (it won t stay in place). Over the course of months I tried to contact Manfrotto so it could be replaced, but got no answer whatsoever. Shame on Manfrotto. 
18167 4 My husband loves his watch but has tucked it away to use on special occasions which I find a bit strange, but I know he is really pleased with it. 
18168 4 I have not had the opportunity to use it to the full extent as of yet, because of my work schedule, but the little time that i have had to play with it I love the small economy size of the camera, and it came with every item as advertised. 
18169 4 This system works well for us as we travel a lot and can watch our home. 
18170 4 Great little quadcopter, perfect for learning. Do buy teh blade protectors for it. 
18171 4 Fast delivered, very nice! 
18172 3 Works Great 
18173 4 I am in love with this product. Works really great on my Nikon d3200. Absolutely recommend this product for others. 
18174 4 I didn t purchase this on amazon but through a local store but I have to say that it takes absolutely gorgeous photos. Really amazing and manually focusing with the A7 cameras is a breeze. Highly recommended. 
18175 4 So far Loving it 
18176 4 great 
18177 4 Works great! 
18178 4 Works great! 
18179 0 I m not happy with this product, is really bad, I d never recommend. 
18180 3 Great compact size camera, i have a canon 60D and it fits fine with a standard lens. 
18181 3 Love it, but the battery life is under 30 seconds. I think there is an issue and I m not sure who to contact. Could you contact us? 
18182 1 I received Different camera that I bough t and I Lost money 
18183 3 Very good 
18184 3 This has helped me from straining my voice from yelling across the house. It s my voice saver. :) 
18185 4 Worked great no issues 
18186 4 Works fine, no problems. 
18187 4 Super easy to put on my D3200. Looks GREAT, and makes the camera easier to grip/hold on to. I have had lots of complements on it. LOVE IT!!! 
18188 4 The motion notifications is amazing. I m able to cut pieces of videos I want and share it with my family. I truly recommend nest cam. I also have the thermostat and is awesome. 
18189 4 this paper is so fun, and now it s so cheap! 
18190 4 Very nice case with lots of adjustable compartments for an additional lens, extra batteries, etc. I would recommend this case to a friend. 
18191 4 Awesome! 
18192 4 Very impressed. Need to see the You Tube video for installation. Takes about 10 minutes to install. Watch the video. 
18193 4 Great insert if you have a bag large enough. 
18194 1 I felt like it was hard to good a good angle.. Complicated and failed when I needed it to work. 
18195 4 cool 
18196 4 Perfect for handgun storage. I own a dozen Pelican cases of different sizes for storing everything from handguns to a high end camera. Foam is pick snd pluck for a perfect fit. Sturdy, water and dust proof. Also TSA compliant for airline travel. 
18197 3 Worked like a champ did have problems with led but you can turn sensitivity down and back up light will go out. I m guessing the bad reviews were given by people using to fast a shutter or to slow a lens. 
18198 3 Good for priceG 
18199 4 Excellent quality photos and easy to use! We had a Canon similar to this for the last 8 years and it just now started using a lot of batteries. Love the zoom and other features! Great color too ;) Will always stick with Canon! 
18200 3 Great...Worked out very well for filming parent children interactions 
18201 4 Fits and works like the original, but at a lower cost. Great deal 
18202 4 Great protection for the camera. It has got a nice little side pouch to stuff in any extra cables, etc. There is also an extra side zipper where i stock extra batteries and sd cards. 
18203 4 Perfectly convenient and durable bag to carry my new camera in that has a nice shoulder strap making it easy and safe to carry. 
18204 4 Good price 
18205 3 Not bad 
18206 4 Definitely met our expectations! Very nice! 
18207 3 enjoying 
18208 4 This bag is perfect for my camera. Durable, quality construction. highly recommended. 
18209 4 A neat gadget for anyone with a smart phone that enjoys photography. It is nice to have a few more options to the iPhone s camera. 
18210 4 It works great with my new camera! 
18211 4 Perfect for my camera. 
18212 0 Couldn t ever figure out how to set up 
18213 4 Good 
18214 4 Charged up easily, held charge, and WORKS! 
18215 0 Quality of pictures was not good. Customer service explained that they might not be compatible with existing analog DVR. He gladly set up a return which I did do. 
18216 4 Great camera and kit for the price! 
18217 4 I bought this case for my husband for his GoPro for our anniversary and I am so glad that I did. It s extremely heavy duty and fits everything including accessories very well. 
18218 4 I love this little camera, so great to check on my property from 3000 miles away. The images are good enough to identify a person s face at a good distance. Totally worth the price. I got this as a gift. 
18219 4 These batteries work well and hold their charge. 
18220 3 Great set to have!!! 
18221 4 Good product. Good service. 
18222 4 Worked fine. 
18223 4 They work awesome, I will recomended this product to everybody. 
18224 4 nice quality 
18225 2 It works fine but the bucle is quite fragile, must close it with care:-) 
18226 4 good product prompt shipment 
18227 4 Works great. I even dropped it shortly after buying it and only a tiny piece chipped off. Wonderful product for the price and greatly extends battery life. I leave it on 24/7 and hardly ever worry about not having enough juice. 
18228 4 great does all the cameras with the one plugin 
18229 4 Lost the one that came with the camera. This worked like a charm and at a great price. 
18230 4 Very happy with this purchase. Prompt shipping and everything arrived as expected. 
18231 4 Came neatly packaged in its box with directions! :) 
18232 4 Works as intended with my vk750ii speedlight. I like that it uses AAA batteries vs hard to find batteries like the altura flash. Two step remote button for focus then capture is a great addition! 
18233 0 Returned this item. No directions as to how to put it together. Did not seem to be flexible enough to move and catch the light in a timely manner. I just use the reflectors by hand now. 
18234 4 Got the charger quickly, without a problem. Charged up our extra batteries and it works fine! 
18235 4 Great tripod for the the price. I am in no way a professional photagrapher but you can tell this is a high quality product. 
18236 4 Perfect little container with premade slots for my basic GoPro equipment. 
18237 4 Works great. The first time I have used a light meter, but in unusual lighting situations it has worked out very well. Why did I wait so long to get one of these? 
18238 4 This camera is amazing just what I was looking for. 
18239 4 fast delivery and good product, works great thanks 
18240 4 Works great. I bought the D3200 Nikon Book for Dummies which helped a lot with initial use. You need to take the time to learn all the features available. The perfect camera for my needs. 
18241 4 This selfie stick gets tons of use! A perfect holster for the Gopro Hero 4. 
18242 4 Very nice. Takes great photos. Just what I needed. Not a blurred photo since I got this camera. 
18243 2 Looks more powerful than it is. I might as well used a small pair of binoculars. It was a birthday gift so I don t want to be to critical... 
18244 4 what an excellent product .leave your premises with no worries and best of all no cables. 
18245 4 Good protection for the camera. Great Product. 
18246 4 I just started taking photos with my camera, and this has made a huge difference in the quality of my photos, especially outdoors. I highly recommend! 
18247 4 Good price. I will buy these again. Got them when they said I would 
18248 3 Great size if only 1 camera and couple lenses. 
18249 1 Not recommended for mounting accessories to your camera rig, since they seem to wobble even when torqued down tightly. 
18250 4 good battery 
18251 4 I have a few old Canon 40D cameras that were in need of new batteries. This package deal of 2 BP-511A batteries plus charger fit the bill perfectly and the price was very reasonable. Very happy with the purchase. 
18252 4 This tripod is very good, it is lightweight which makes traveling easy while being sturdy considering its weight. But most important of all the tripod has great stability and captures good videos for vlogging and pictures for memories. 
18253 4 Delivered on time. Great price. Works great. 
18254 4 Easy to use and the zoom power is great 
18255 4 Just what I needed to keep my Canon lenses and sensor clean, at a good price 
18256 3 Lens seemed to get a little foggy, but easily wipes off. 
18257 1 Not what I expected. 
18258 3 WiFi is weak and not friendly. Reverted to an Eye-Fi card. Good price. 
18259 4 This bag is perfect for travel and allows me the versatility of packing not only all my camera equipment and computer, but also other small things I need from my purse so that it is not necessary for me to carry a purse any longer. 
18260 4 This is great. It keeps me from backing in the garage too far. 
18261 4 A little bit of learning curve but truly great resolution and ease of use! 
18262 3 Good camera for the price. If you want to have a high quality camera for vacation, causal shooting and etc, this is perfect. But if you aim for more professional shooting, this is not enough 
18263 3 good sttuff 
18264 3 OK. What was sold was an older version.than current new. So far so good. Wish it had a a zoom! 
18265 4 batteries came charged and lasted a good amount of time 
18266 4 As Tina Turner says &#34;simply the best!&#34; 
18267 1 Loved the binoculars , but they were toast after dropping them ONE TIME. I baby all of my gear, but come on... You re outdoors and things happen. If your product is shoddy enough to break after one little drop, I ll look elsewhere. 
18268 4 Works great. 
18269 4 Love this bag!!! Very cute and roomy too! The material feels nice as well 
18270 4 Great price. 
18271 3 Good product, but NO MANUAL. Be careful. Frustrating to install but once it s done, it works very well. Until now, I don t know how to create multiple PIN and delete existing.. 
18272 0 Why can t you at least provide 1 hour of video history for free? I don t need or want 7 days of video. All I need to see what just happened a few minutes ago. 
18273 2 Good entry level mount system. Works great on road; but allows camera wobble when off road. I have since gone to a metal mount with a rigid clamp system. 
18274 1 While adjusting the angle gently, it broke. I super-glued it back together but now it s at an odd angle and looks fake. If it wasn t broken it would look okay for the price. 
18275 4 Fast delivery and pretty quick charge. Great product, as stated. Haven t used it besides charging cause I bought them to replace the one I lost due to really not using the camera. We will see how well they hold a charge this weekend in Disneyworld :-) 
18276 4 I lost my camera 
18277 3 Good product and transaction. 
18278 4 Excellent product, price and delivery 
18279 4 It s great 😍 
18280 4 Cheap, and work like a charm 
18281 4 Excellent product, fits and protect the camera (nikon 5200) and all my gear perfect 
18282 2 This camera has nice zoom range and video capability but the picture quality is only average. 
18283 0 it sucks 
18284 1 Hard to adjust and kind of looks stupid in your head. It works, but I immediately started looking for other methods. 
18285 4 It was perfect. After all it is just a lens cap. 
18286 4 Just what I was looking for to be able to attach a small microphone to the side for better voice clarity. Fits perfectly into the tripod as well. Good choice. 
18287 4 Works perfectly! 
18288 4 Excellent 
18289 4 IT S WHAT I SPECTED. GOOD! 
18290 0 Ended up returning this item as it did not correctly describe that it does not support continuous streaming. 
18291 4 Stand is worth the money. Stable & ridged. adjustments work and it folds up small. 
18292 2 Not the highest quality picture but gets the job done. Close up range is rather narrow. Looks like winter all year long. Everything green is white. 
18293 3 Great little camera. Has the features and then some. Easy to allow your creative side to come forward. 
18294 2 Great case except could use a little more room for batteries and charges so it could be a complete kit 
18295 4 Purchased this for a backup for a wedding. Works great. 
18296 4 I didn t expect it for a week and it came 2 days later. Awesome!!!! Love it. Keep up the good work!!! 
18297 0 Video is ok, set up is rather easy although not well explained, especially for iOS. However, both my Foscam monitors clicks very loudly throughout day and night, waking up my kids every single night. Both my monitors are now in the attic collecting dusts. 
18298 4 This is exactly what I needed for my camera. The product was on time and worked perfectly. I need a backup battery for my Nikon Prosumer camera and will by from this seller. 
18299 4 Still learning how to use it, so far it s been a great tool 
18300 4 Love this camera so far!! Am learning to shoot in manual mode to get even sharper images!!! Only wish it had a view finder!!!! 
18301 4 Great product!!!! Incredible at evening out light.... Great for on the go photographers. 
18302 4 All went well with the purchase 
18303 4 Took these as backups on several trips and they worked flawlessly. They seem to get a bit less charge than the oem Sony battery, but definitely worth it considering the price difference. Used in a Sony RX100 m2 camera. 
18304 4 Excellent fit for my 7D MKii Great! 
18305 0 The worst matte box ever !!! Don t waste your money and you time !!! 
18306 4 Works great - light is bright, and close up picture (macro lens) is great. 
18307 4 It took me a little patience to put the hood and lens cover on with the filter already on. I first thought it wouldn t fit and then just &#34;relaxed&#34; and tried again! I like having the different filters and the case as well. 
18308 4 Works as expected, very sturdy and doesn t slide around, attaches well to the camera. The product was shipped and delivered surprisingly quickly. All around very happy with the product and order. 
18309 0 Do not like it 
18310 4 Nice quality product. Excellent price! Delivered on time. 
18311 4 I m not a camera person...not what I expected... 
18312 4 very good 
18313 3 This is a good bag, and is a very good size. I just wish there were more padding included to make it a bit more stiff. 
18314 3 Very durable, nice camera bag. It gets a little tight when packing more than one lens, but mostly fits what I need. It looks nice and I feel my camera is protected. 
18315 4 Really Nice Case 
18316 4 Awesome camera, great features easy operation. 
18317 1 In fact it was not a good buy. The product has good resistance, but unfortunately my shaft with the cake support bar, which causes the two wheels never touch the ground. Also bad finish of the wheels that generate some shaky movements. 
18318 4 Cleans better then expected. I got it for my ASUSZ T200 and it cleaned my wife s ipad better then her cloth. 
18319 4 Happy with product. 
18320 2 The app for the phone sucks I have HTC m8 I can download the videos and pictures but I when I watch the videos no sound 
18321 1 Love some pieces but the tripod stand is not sturdy, gave it to the kids to play. Many pieces missing in the package too. Not happy, will not recommend it. 
18322 0 1st pair I purchased worked ok for several months until it stopped synching properly. The new pair never synched properly and I was not able to return it because my first photo shoot was after the return period. Very disappointed. 
18323 4 I just unpacked and assemble and I m very happy with it. The seller shipped it quickly, it was double boxed and arrived in excellent shape, even all of the light bulbs worked. The quality is very good. I would buy from this seller again! 
18324 4 Great camera. Use it while boating, camping. Fine photos and meets all my expectations. 
18325 4 Good Quality. It came with Nikon D3100 bundle. So nice to have this once if you buy bundle. Personally I don t use it often though. But yeah sometime you required this. If you are not buying any other lens 18mm-55mm and 55-200mm will work great for beginners. 
18326 3 Not as flexible as i was hoping, but it s very sturdy. 
18327 2 Not bad. 
18328 4 Great. The perfect cost effective solution to water fun with my coolpix. 
18329 4 Really nice strap. Works just as your expect. I almost bought one of the Black Rapids straps, but this one is higher quality and more attractive. Looks damn sharp 
18330 3 Excellent product ! Thoroughly recommend - super for glasses ! 
18331 4 I AM SURE I WILL LIKE IT, IF I CAN EVER PURCHASE ONE. HAS BEEN ON BACK-ORDER AND MAY NOT BE AVAIL. FOR ANOTHER MONTH. 
18332 3 I purchased this item for my 13 year old granddaughter. She likes it, but has not used it enough to offer meaningful feedback. Delivery was prompt. I was surprised it was delivered on Sunday. 
18333 3 Fits perfectly and easy to hold onto. looking forward to using it in Hawaii! 
18334 3 Work good and last a long time on a full charge 
18335 4 Excellent. More than I expected. It has so many functions that you may not have to use the retouching programs. The Zoom is awesome !! 
18336 4 SO COOL 
18337 4 Great product! 
18338 4 Nice device. Clear and compact enough to carry easy. 
18339 4 Excellent walking stick with camera mounting at good price. 
18340 4 The system is great. Simple to install and makes you feel safer. 
18341 4 nice little camera 
18342 4 Great grab n go back for your DSLR, and a few lenses and accessories. 
18343 4 Even it is not perfect goods,but still has all the key features a security camera needs. 
18344 4 Great for cleaning eyeglasses and small screens They can be easily stored in your pocket for that on the go cleaning 
18345 4 I got one and then bought one for my wife. They are a simple point and shoot that does a good job of taking photos. 
18346 4 Handy 
18347 2 Charger works great! I like the fact that you can charge you batteries AC/DC. Batteries not so good! 
18348 2 Waste of money. Save you dollars and by a good macro lens 
18349 4 Once installed, I was able to increase my original GPS from 4 satellites to 9 and fly safely. 
18350 4 Perfect fit. Same as the ones that came with drone 
18351 4 Great everyday lens, need the hood to prevent glare thought 
18352 4 nice 
18353 4 Great camera still learning how to use it properly 
18354 4 great Companion to my Pentax K-50 
18355 4 These are like some smaller ones I bought for eye glasses except much larger and a better value. They are great for large screens or any surface I do not want to scratch. They are one of the best I ve ever used. 
18356 4 Very nice night vision picture quality for the price. 
18357 4 Perfect replacement unit for my aging ADEMCO - Drop in replacement, didn t have to program a thing. 
18358 4 I have already used a few of these packs and just started on the shiny stars pack! All the film works great and I love love the themes! I def recommend this pack as it was also such an awesome deal!! I use this with my Instax 8 
18359 4 The battery last a long time. Simple to use and to download. They produce surprisingly clear video.exceeds my expectation. 
18360 4 Perfect 
18361 4 Battery last for very long time and quickly charges. The power of this Flash is far more than I expected. Time between firing the flash is very short, leap change compared to Canon 430 EX II Flash 
18362 4 Fast shipping, just as expected! Thanks! 
18363 4 good quality product. I ll buy it again. 
18364 4 Easy, fast, safe and comfortable! Easely fit a 24-70 2.8L ii 
18365 1 Brought two as gifts but you get what you paid for. The power adapter gets &#34;hot&#34;, not warm but hot. The unit would restart for no reason. The speakers are low end. Would not purchase this again. 
18366 1 to big and complicated to use 
18367 4 Camera case is very nice and my camera fits nicely into it. It has good padding and places for batteries. I didn t want something too big. Perfect. 
18368 3 Worked as expected. 
18369 4 Great plan 
18370 0 Followed directions, plugged in, little spark, died. 
18371 4 good quality 
18372 1 very shaky if attached to moving position. 
18373 2 cheap 
18374 3 Great lens to be used with Canon DSLR cameras. I hated to purchase the Canon brand lens for so much more, when I only use this lens as a hobby. Great zoom lens for a good price. 
18375 4 Works perfectly, fits perfectly, highly recommended !! 
18376 3 Works great Wish they offered a round version for people with glasses 
18377 4 Great Camera. Got it to send pictures with the Wi-Fi. Works great. Easy to use. A+ 
18378 1 It is good to have it, but hard to use it, 
18379 4 Excellent multi section monopod. Reduces to just over 15 in to easily fit in small suite cast. Easy to extend sections quickly. Strong when it is extended. Light weight. 
18380 4 Love this zoom lense. You just need to make sure you have a way to stabilize it for. 
18381 4 It works great 
18382 1 Broke after a month of use. 
18383 2 Works but it came in a case far to large for a 58mm filter. Also the case had a large crack going down the front of it. 
18384 4 Great 
18385 4 No problems 
18386 3 re-furbished- so was not sure about the quality. met my expectations. thanks 
18387 4 There are many times I want my binoculars but its just not easy to lug around my full sized set. These are serious binoculars with good optics, weight, and feel. As with all Vortex they carry a no hassle lifetime replacement 
18388 4 The charger was fast and the batteries held their charge. The entire set was great for my trip to the Caribbean. 
18389 0 pictures were blurry and underdeveloped 
18390 4 Great little machine. The company is having growing pains in the customer service area, but the device is first rate. 
18391 4 Very Good Product 
18392 1 You can only replay video that was recently recorded using your mobile device. When going back a day or two it takes a very long time if at all. The image and sound is delayed. Not worth $10 a month in my opinion. 
18393 4 The best lens on the planet! Dont settle for anything else..., 
18394 0 No support. 
18395 4 All lenses should be protected with this inexpensive &#34;insurance&#34;. Works as advertised and expected of a Nikon product. 
18396 4 My toddler pulled Grandma s Nikon D50 off the kitchen table and broke the bayonet ring on the lens. Rather than buying a new lens, I was able to replace the mounting ring! 
18397 4 Perfect 
18398 0 poor image, poor focal range, not for small places, poor battery, poor software and manual, sound better than image. it s a middle range USB pen drive more than a camera. 
18399 4 Loved this set! A great versatile set-up, looks professional, obviously not quite what you would get for hundreds more dollars, but I was very impressed. The lightboxes are really nice and the backdrops are huge and work well. The carrying cases are very nice. 
18400 0 Very low quality battery. I get about 40 shots on a fully charged battery before it goes dead. By comparison, my 3 year old Canon battery gets 300+ shots on a charge. Would not recommend. 
18401 3 The clamp has an adjustable rubber band inside the jaws. Useful in keeping the clamp from sliding forward. The gooseneck is eghh... 
18402 4 GREAT!!!! 
18403 4 great product used it to take family group pictures and didnt have to hire a photographer to do it set it up and used the remote to take the group picture with love it 
18404 4 Durable and stays in place.. Highly recommend 
18405 4 Good quality glass with convenient carrying case. 
18406 4 Very sturdy and fits camera well. 
18407 4 love the product works very well. Can charge multiple products and is very well made. 
18408 4 Word great.Idea Product 
18409 4 Delivers as promised. Works very well and included the 12v and european converter. Great price 
18410 4 good quality 
18411 3 The user interface leaves a lot to be desired and the motion alert and recording fails constantly. But it is cheap and otherwise works. My one worry is that if the manufacturer ever stop supporting it via their website then the device is entirely useless and inaccessible. 
18412 4 Works great. Just what I needed. 
18413 0 The insight switch would not connect to the internet. I was on the phone with Belkin and they couldn t help. The cam connected to the internet but it kept losing connection. Sent them back. 
18414 4 love it.nice and light.compact.fits my canon perfect.nice traveling case 
18415 4 excellent deal, no complaints , and fast ship, thanks, -J 
18416 4 The LCD screen on your camera could easily be scratched. You re crazy if you don t use a screen protector. 
18417 4 The build quality is superb. It s solid and balances nicely on my D610. Produces beautiful portraits with nice bokeh. A favorite of mine. 
18418 4 perfect 
18419 3 thanks 
18420 4 ok 
18421 4 used mine in a dive off the coast of la jolla and it took great pictures and videos 
18422 4 Simple to operate. Gives more value for the money, and gives quality pictures & videos. 
18423 4 Wow what a camera 
18424 2 Works but takes a lot of practice. 
18425 4 Fantastic 
18426 1 A little bit disappointed with the unit. Picture is not as bright as another brand that I already have. Besides that when displaying some of the pictures it cuts them so I can t see the picture complete. I bought it to give it to my brother as a present. 
18427 4 Bought for grandson. He has used several times and loves wearing it while he captures all the action. Fits comfortably and doesn t slide. Even wore it white water rafting. 
18428 4 good deal! 
18429 3 Good quality for the money. 
18430 4 First class! 
18431 1 Picture makes it look big but in reality it is very small. 
18432 0 It is super tiny and incredibly uncomfortable. Not sure what human this was designed for :-( Sorry. 
18433 4 Perfect - works great! 
18434 4 Works well! 
18435 4 very good 
18436 2 The Flycam 5000 is harder to balance then it looks. I am still working at it. 
18437 4 Works well with Olympus C5060 and C7070. 
18438 4 It s convenient to dive 
18439 4 Product received in a timely manner and as listed/pictured. Thanks! 
18440 2 No need for warning tag. Price can be reduced 
18441 4 Nice camera. Order came on time. 
18442 4 Product packaging solid, fully applicable to outdoor sports, good quality, practical,I have used the suction cup and it did a fantastic job,and will use other accessories for a free time. 
18443 4 One of the best thing i ever did i think this lens is magic,of course lens like this Tripod must if you want the best result. 
18444 1 Seemed cool at first, but the problem is that while it shows what you re taking a picture of, this item attaches to your lens and will blow out photos due to the way the lens attaches over and doesn t compensate. 
18445 4 Good system overall. I wish the codec was in a .mov or .m4v format instead of .avi. 
18446 4 Love them 
18447 4 Easy to install, fixed my problem (scratched lens). A whole new case is only $15, but save a few bucks and this works just as well. 
18448 4 My niece loves it 
18449 2 good, but I like the other one I purchased better 
18450 4 works great 
18451 4 very nice 
18452 3 Awsome product! I used everything in this kit and it was all A ok. My only complaint being the plastic is a lil cheap not high rated type I feal. 
18453 3 cool nice pic and video for the money 
18454 4 Easy to assemble, fun to use! 
18455 3 Super nice and light for a case this size. Wish they made it for the Phantom 3. 
18456 4 works great. 
18457 4 I am So glad to have left the Nikon/Canon world behind, after playing with this x body for almost a full month there s NO way that I would go back to the BIG two. A+++ 
18458 4 Good for the price 
18459 4 Great 
18460 4 Perfect lens for my camera shoots. Sharp pictures. 
18461 4 Good, just don t use it while diving 
18462 4 Works great and fast delivery. 
18463 4 Fantastic binoculars for the money. Watched 2 wolves fighting over an elk carcass with 2 grizzlies in Yellowstone on their first use. Wouldn t have been possible without them 
18464 4 Great product, works as it should. Delivery was fast and without issues. 
18465 3 Worked perfectly. It lets me use my old Vivitar telephoto lens on my Nikon D3100. 
18466 0 I couldn t resist the 2-pack, but quickly lost both due to a not so secure fit. The eyepieces just don t seem to click in the same way as the OEM part does. 
18467 4 PERFECT 
18468 4 Good size for my camera. Plenty of pockets for accessories. 
18469 4 Awesome Charging Device ... Works exactly as advertised! 
18470 3 Pretty awesome compared to most tripods I ve seen. I only wish the feet were heavier for two reasons - so they d drop and fully extend without pulling, and to be more stable. It s nice and light for carrying. 
18471 4 Product as described...works great 
18472 2 I bought this as a replacement for my battery pack, but this one broke off in the camera as I was pulling it out. Worked great, but not super heavy duty 
18473 4 Although it s cheap, it works swimmingly. I sank my point and shoot in the sink to test it first and then took it to Cancun and the Green River in Moab (not in the same day). Worked perfect and kept the camera dry. 
18474 4 American Craftsmanship at its BEST. Far nicer , more functional, and less expensive than the OEM grip!!!! 
18475 4 This is exactly the head I was wanting to get. 
18476 3 Great, my brother love it. 
18477 4 good 
18478 4 I lost my charger and this was a very cost effective replacement. It even came with a battery when I only needed the charger. So now I have two! I haven t tried the car charger yet so I can t comment on that item. 
18479 3 works well as advertised. Beware that Disney parks do not allow it to be carried inside just like other parks. It can not fit in the pocket. But otherwise does its job well. 
18480 0 the filters came unprotected one of them is al scratch up. Will return them. 
18481 3 Great Product 
18482 4 Battery and charger work perfectly!!! You brought my old video camara back to life!!! Thanks!! 
18483 4 Perfect 
18484 2 Just used it once for in car race video in dirt oval stock car worked fine. not go pro quality I suppose but for 50$ i ll use it again even had a bit of a wreck and no glitch.no trouble when used with PNY brand micro sd card. 
18485 0 When you zoom out you get a black vignette. 
18486 4 great price for a great product 
18487 4 A little difficult to figure out when you first get it. But once you figure it out, it works great. Great for long exposure photos. 
18488 3 All is ok! 
18489 4 It functions the way that I expected. 
18490 4 Great batteries. Would buy again. 
18491 4 Works Great 
18492 2 Build quality is cheap, but that s the norm nowadays. Light as a feather. Battery life is less than I expected. Projector works as expected, enough to share pictures and movies while out and about. 
18493 0 All batteries came expired. Very disappointed 
18494 2 Some access were missing. 
18495 3 Good wireless camera system. A little bit of interference based on distance. 
18496 0 garbage 
18497 0 Not the best quality, it is hard to make the lens move, sometimes as if it was stucked and the pictures are not really high-pitched. 
18498 4 Great camera. I ll be buying another soon! 
18499 3 Fits my new Jamstik+ perfectly, with room to spare for strap and other accessories. One star off for the extremely long shipping time, but the wait was worth it. 
18500 4 Great price! 
18501 4 Came with everything I needed to put it on and the instructions were easy to follow. 
18502 4 rec d as promised and as advertised 
18503 4 As advertised. Works just as well as the OEM batteries and I will buy more in the near future. 
18504 2 I wish I could say I love this bag. Oddly, it doesn t hang right. It s very uncomfortable to carry. Hangs at a strange angle. The snaps are very difficult to close. It looks fabulous, but I never use it. It s become a storage bag. 
18505 2 They do work, but are pretty cheap on the tie on end 
18506 3 Looks good and fits well - no complaints. 
18507 4 Fast delivery and worked perfectly! 
18508 4 I haven t had a chance to use the tripod with my camera yet but it looks good and easy to use. 
18509 4 Aircraft flys extremely well but am having problems with video. This is the second one. DJI seems to be having problems with transmitting video from aircraft to controller. Ritz Camera is very very fast with their shipping. Very pleased with Ritz. 
18510 0 Door doesn t even close right, the foam inside does not hold the battery tight the place where the iPad is advertised to go is filled with foam. Would not recommend this to someone else 
18511 3 follows up on any issue. Good quality cabes. 
18512 4 Do yourself a favor and swap out your heavier aluminum rails for some of these. 
18513 4 This lens is great 
18514 4 worked great! Good value. 
18515 4 Best E mount lens out there 
18516 4 this is easily be the single best monopod i have ever owned! 
18517 4 good camera, night vision and internet based monitoring 
18518 4 So far, I really like this camera and their technical support is awesome. Today I needed assistance connecting my camera to my i-phone and the Foscam technician (Calvin) was very informative and helpful in assisting me. 
18519 4 Henry was a good tech, Henry helped me with clearing up my major issues I was having with my connections.Thanks Henry for your help. 
18520 4 Perfect---quality and shipping! 
18521 4 This strap works great, it is adjustable to fit hand size and camera height. Noticeable increase in stability. 
18522 4 Works Great! Love the Price 
18523 3 This tripod will work; i like it. 
18524 4 Fit perfect. Good quality. 
18525 3 Good set of pouches to protect your lenses. 
18526 4 I thought it was going to be difficult to apply. Maybe I would get it off center or with an air bubble but it was very easy to apply. Now my new camera is protected. 
18527 4 Great price and great quality. 
18528 0 I took this to my trip to the Philippines. One of the activities I used it for was tubing - horrible decision. My GoPro snapped off and got lost in the river! Thank goodness the locals found my GoPro after a couple of days. 
18529 4 Works well. 
18530 3 The camera is very good and easy to use. The case that I bought, and was recommended, CASE LOGIC DCB-302 is too small for this camera and someone made a mistake suggesting this casa to be purchased along with this Olympus. I will return the case. 
18531 4 I mounted this to my airsoft gun, fits on their tight, didn t need to tighten after a few hours. 
18532 4 As someone who uses my gopro a lot for just random purposes, it s awesome! I ve had it now for about a month, but I ll do a proper review later on. So far though, I take it everywhere! 
18533 4 Product was exactly as described and at a great price !!! 
18534 3 excellent purchase, exactly what I needed! 
18535 0 One product is missing. 
18536 4 grabacion aceptable 
18537 4 Cheap, works well with my J1. 
18538 4 Works great, gives a little more room when turning the camera to portrait 
18539 4 Great it works 
18540 4 Works as advertised 
18541 4 Works great! Refurbished but it s a very small accessory with a small case designed to attach to the strap. The WPS button and indicator light is an easy setup along with the Nikon WMU app. 
18542 4 It was prefect beside that strap that made my camera drop but it okay so I am happy 
18543 4 Does the job! 
18544 3 Thank you 
18545 4 Very strong item. I would highly recommend this to protect your high dollar camera on the DJI Phantom 3. 
18546 4 Incredible barging 
18547 4 Owned one exactly like this and loved using it. It met my every need; traveling, pictures for newspapers and monthly articles about our club. Was happy to be able to find the this camera to replace the one that was worn out. 
18548 4 Perfect size for mirror-less system and 3 lenses. Using with a Sony a6000 and could not be happier. The belt stores when not needed and included should strap helps to stabilize. Think Tank is, as always, very robust and well built. Thumbs up! 
18549 4 Excellent 
18550 4 Great Product .....easy to use ! 
18551 3 Not easy to adjust the length But it seems that the quality is good, I felt that the product I ordered was too old or used because the stick was covered by dust inside its Box. 
18552 2 Works well but the swivel isn t very strong and can t support a camera in every position. 
18553 0 I was very disappointed to find that the lens opening on the case is too small for the Samsung WB350F. The lens opens but then shuts down. Bummer! It s too bad as it was just what I was looking for! 
18554 4 Holds a charge, better than the one that came with it. 
18555 0 Horrible Item. Cameras POS. 
18556 3 Having trouble with this camera. Went to the Bahamas and it only took a few pictures. Very disapointed. 
18557 3 So far so good. Will see how batteries hold up 
18558 4 Great filter...is very much as promised by the manufacturer...I have the X1CPL polarizer and it is just as good. 
18559 3 Needed sleeves to hold index cards on a magnetic white board, these worked out. 
18560 4 I love it. 
18561 4 Very Nice 
18562 1 I like the style of it but the functionality just isn t there. The sliding on switch didn t stay in the on position so if you wanted to turn it on you had to hold the button down. It did come with 4 color filters which was cool. 
18563 1 Pretty good although it will not work with the Sony vixia hf r62 with the battery attached. You can remove the battery and stuff it in next to the main unit. This would have been helpful to know before I bought. 
18564 4 Easy enough for a monkey to install. Prettier than a foscam. 
18565 4 Good product I enjoyed using it 
18566 4 Very good battery, I use it all the time, thank you. 
18567 0 Cheap! Broke 
18568 4 Works like a charm, people think these are real cameras! 
18569 4 Love it 
18570 4 Great product for the price. Nicely made and the length is long enough to cross over your body. The camera lays about hip length. The color is vibrant and the leather gives a secure feeling to hold a heavy camera. 
18571 4 very good 
18572 3 Bought for Son s birthday. Awkward to download data. 
18573 4 good product. Fits my lens perfectly. 
18574 3 good little tripod. could be more sturdy, but overall, not bad quality. 
18575 4 Very good!! Works very well..we can see in the TV...it was awesome!! 
18576 4 Great price, great fit, fast shipping - a five star seller! Just as good as Nikons - as if they really make them!!!! 
18577 4 The cords arrived very quickly and they are really nice heavy quality 
18578 4 Nice product for sure. Very quickly delivered and was everything I had expected. Many thanks:) 
18579 1 I expected the front to hang from the back cover when you take off the front cover to take a picture, but it always falls off. It looks great, fits great but not useable in the field. I returned this. 
18580 4 I like these better than my other baluns that are longer with a swivel - this connection isn t flawless but more dependable than the other kind 
18581 2 Picture quality is decent, so is audio stream. However the motion detection is very inconsistant. Sometimes they alert for no reason and othertimes you can walk through the room with no alert. 
18582 3 Great product. Haven t had a change to use it much yet but it seems to support my Vortex 85 spotting scope well, 
18583 4 Excellent lens with great optics. A little challenging to get in focus off hand in lower lighting, but it will force you to take better thought out shots. It s my only lens carried on my camera now, even though I have several. VERY flexible! 
18584 4 I really love the quality of these lens covers. perfectly easy to used and step up. Now to get the other size for my smaller lens. 
18585 0 Stop working after the 2nd day. 
18586 4 Cannot tell the fake TV from the real one. 
18587 4 Love this lens on my Nikon D3200. I bought this for a walk around lens for vacation however I haven t had it off the camera since getting it. 
18588 1 When used in the manner describe on the back, all the labels will be upside down to the user. Seems like a design oversight/flaw. It is also much smaller than other similar charts making it harder to find what you want or read the (upside down) labels. 
18589 3 You have to take off the front ring of the LX7 and the Neewer cap bayonets into its place. Its not very elegant looking but works very well. I have had it on the camera for a couple of months now and it works flawlessly. 
18590 0 Simply didn t work ...bought 2 thinking first one was defective ...got 2nd one ....same results Kept giving me same reading regardless if I increase intensity of my flash or light source ....or near pitch darkness. 
18591 4 they are great quality, but I though it would work with reflectors, but it only works with lights 
18592 4 Excellent... love the camera and accessories so far... Not sure why Panasonic doesn t include the adaptor and batteries with the camera like other brands... 
18593 3 Works very well with my camera 
18594 4 It is a great little camera 
18595 3 Holds photos well very cute but only has 49 pockets NOT 72 
18596 4 Love the look and the feel. My son bought a pair and raved about the support. I totally agree and I have sensitive at times painful feet. 
18597 4 Fits great to my Phanton 3 drone 
18598 4 Great little camera -awesome pictures. Usually always just use my phone, but decided to try small camera for Hawaiian vacation 
18599 4 Great product, good price! 
18600 4 Love it 
18601 4 Great camera I only wish it am with a sim card. 
18602 4 So glad I got extra batteries for the GoPro!! Dive trips with multiple dives and video made the extra batteries a must! 
18603 4 I have a small point and shoot and wanted bag that would be a better fit. Yes this bag is the better fit for my needs 
18604 4 Strong design and perfect size for my monopod Oben ACM-2400L 4. 
18605 4 It did exactly what I needed it to do it stable , lightweight and easy to transport 
18606 3 camera fits well in case. Product received promptly by seller 
18607 4 love it all!! Great camera! 
18608 4 Good product. Works as advertised. 
18609 4 Happy with product. 
18610 3 Everything was there... save for the instruction book. Would really like the instruction book. How can I get the instruction manual... other than I love the camera. 
18611 4 Love the high-speed sync without the typical high-speed sync pricing! The recycle time is a little slower than I d like but, for the price, it s worth it. 
18612 4 this is a nice case to put all of your equipment in 
18613 4 Perfecto por ahora. 
18614 0 Diferent 
18615 4 Really enjoy the camera strap. Had a Joby previous and was unhappy with the thin strap. The shoulder pad on the Fastfire is much more comfortable. I prefer the attachment point of the Fastfire. Never really felt secure with the mounting point on the threaded tripod hole. 
18616 3 Fit well on Sony a6000. Pain in the A** changing battery! 
18617 3 Quality is okay for the price. 
18618 0 takes great photos but the stripes ripped off!!!!! don t buy cheap plastic. I want a full refund 
18619 3 Easily telescopes and is pretty durable 
18620 2 Definitely small. Good for specific uses but going to need something bigger to hold everything I have. 
18621 4 Nice product, all is well 
18622 4 Good 
18623 3 Still being exposed... 
18624 2 It does work for it s purpose. However, when the mount is screwed all the way in, the GoPro doesn t line up straight with the way the handle faces. 
18625 4 Works just like a cell phone screen protector! It was perfect! 
18626 4 Easy set up. Simple to install. Cameras work really well. 
18627 4 Great case for the price to protect my lens. 
18628 2 I was expecting this bag to be smaller. from the photo it looks like i can fit the fuji polaroid 210 perfectly in there. I can fir the camera in there and a small village. good quality though, shipped quick so kudos. 
18629 2 it would work great with light weight speedlight but not able to lock well on heavier ones 
18630 4 best thing ever to be created 
18631 1 Didn t fit camera. 
18632 0 camera does not record to micro sd, the software that came with it doesn t work either. 
18633 4 Fast delivery. Works great! 
18634 3 Highly recommended for The Phantom 2 users! This gimbal is awesome! took my ability to capture smooth crystal clear video from my gopro hero 3+ Black to a whole new level! 
18635 4 Every accessory I can think to use. 
18636 4 I received the batteries promptly and they are as advertise I am very please. 
18637 3 Works good. 
18638 4 Review for GoPro 4 Ssolid snug fit with all parts and pieces. no cover for the additional UV lens though which stinks but at least they throw in a lens cover for when the UV lens is not on. Overall very happy 
18639 4 great 
18640 3 I bought this per recommendation of my mentor, who s an experienced prof photographer, and he was not mistaken, it s a great product! 
18641 0 Samsung s server has been unavailable since I received this item on Thursday (today being Sunday). Friday when I called Samsung, they said they were sure it would be taken care of by the end of the day - it wasn t. 
18642 2 Wouldn t fit my camera good quality those. 
18643 4 Great product! I live on the gulf of mexico and have used my Smapole about a dozen times in the saltwater and it has worked great and shows zero signs of wear or rust! 
18644 4 Received quickly, all parts and items were accounted for and in condition indicated. Great set of accessories at a great price! 
18645 4 I love it,bought it few years ago for Canon T1i and it still works fine, using it with Canon T4i. 
18646 4 great back up batterys and came quick in mail 
18647 4 Installed it myself. That went smoothly all parts labeled clearly-what plugs into what-etc. Did need help from support to get the remote access working Amcrest s support was excellent. Still exploring the feature-rich capabilities of the system. Very satisfied with the product. 
18648 4 satisfied This product was very satisfactory and much fun for all the family I would highly recommend this product delivery was prompt. 
18649 0 These are a joke. Wasted my money 
18650 2 It is an older version no metal on locking holes and fastners are not double throw. 
18651 4 Great little umbrella for location work. Inexpensive, easy to use. 
18652 4 Much better than the 5X5 cloth you get with your glasses or sunglasses. This is exactly what I expected and the price was right! 
18653 4 Love it! 
18654 4 This is a fantastic camera for the price. It has a very good quality image, both day and night. 
18655 4 Very good video quality, best bang for the buck. 
18656 3 It s always good to have a few extra batteries handy 
18657 4 I am using this, along with several other cameras, in my vacation home in Arizona. I use it in conjunction with an INSTEON HUB, these work together very well and was easy to set up. 
18658 4 Looks very nice and the quality is very good. Is a bit uncomfortable to open take off the whole thing when you want to take the memory card out, but it s not a big deal. 
18659 4 Great deal 
18660 4 This was a great purchase 
18661 4 Coolest invention ever, I use it all my smartphones and you get stability of steadicam on your smartphone. 
18662 4 Product was as advertised. 
18663 3 not bad 
18664 4 excellent product. 
18665 4 SFSG....and you can t beat the $$$$$ 
18666 2 It s an &#34;okay&#34; system. The software is a bit tricky to sync with the camera itself. The picture quality in daylight is fantastic, but in low light the picture quality is poor. Seems to work fine. Does the job. 
18667 0 Cheaply made, only use for storage, will fall apart if you actually try to ship it. 
18668 4 i use it all the time on hikes and under water 
18669 4 it was the exact size I need it! 
18670 4 This camera is amazing and takes the best pictures! 
18671 4 Good quality, and firm connection without being too tight. 
18672 4 very well pleased with this purchase 
18673 4 I bought this camera because i was seldom at home,i could speak directly with my family when i was on a business trip. 
18674 4 Great deal 
18675 4 Great tipod for travelling fits every backpack 
18676 0 poor quality. It looks and feels like a cheap plastic toy. 
18677 4 Exactly what the picture and description shows. 
18678 4 they fit my camera perfectly... 
18679 2 Not able to keep lens pen in pen holder. Side Pockets are very tiny and unusable. Padding is not great at the bottom. 
18680 4 Great price! Much better quality than I was expecting. Very user friendly. 
18681 4 It works great on my camcorder. 
18682 3 Good camera for the price. 
18683 4 Great it works. 
18684 0 Cheap! software was not user friendly. The siren kept going off at every movement because software wouldn t save settings to shut it off. I ended up getting the Kodak camera to replace this. 
18685 3 Recommended by Amazon when I bought my Sony A3000. Just barely fits camera and extra batteries. Consider something bigger if you plan on carrying extra lenses, chargers, etc. 
18686 2 Good quality, has trouble staying on when moving fast 
18687 4 Bought this as &#34;refurbished&#34; - Nikon approved. Delivered &#34;as new&#34;. Saved about 60% so was well worth it. 
18688 0 The product s instructions were in Japanese and completely unusable. Previous review was not accepted by Amazon 
18689 4 Works great 
18690 0 Camera plastic mount broke off after 6 months. 
18691 4 good price.... 
18692 4 Awesome lens! Totally great from a business perspective. You have to have lots of room to get everything in view when indoors, but the bokeh is beautiful and it s quick and sharp focus. Totally love this lens! 
18693 3 Works great but rotation left/right has not been working. 
18694 0 lite came to me in an obviously pre opened box.lite is missing battery holding part.no instructions leaflet to advise type of batteries to use.i only paid 10 bucks. not worth the hassle to return it. 
18695 4 Works great. Fast delivery! Awesome. 
18696 4 good little camera for my needs. 
18697 4 legit 
18698 4 Just what I wanted in a flash. I needed something with more power than the built in flash. It s great for inside photos, but I wanted it for photos of owls in our tall trees in our yard. Love it! 
18699 4 great 
18700 4 Love how this thing softens the light, love how lightweight it is and its so easy to install and compact to carry, definitely im buying more and ill be switching the softboxes for these 
18701 4 GREAT 
18702 4 Danny @ tech support was patient, knowledgeable and awesome!! 
18703 3 The strap does not stay on. Lens protective filter works great. 
18704 4 Works fantastic!!! 
18705 1 Missing 1 of the sd cards. 
18706 4 Ugh...it works! Lol. Good construction and fit both tripod and gopro fine! 
18707 4 I got this for my 67mm canon lense to proactive from scratches. Works great and my lense cap fits over it nicely. 
18708 4 Great 
18709 4 easy way to carry an extra battery 
18710 3 its a good head strap for a cheap price. use it a lot 
18711 4 Give you that assurance of tight fit. 
18712 4 Great product 
18713 4 Great for the price. Bought new camera and only had one battery 
18714 0 Worked for a week then stopped now no computer recognizes external connection - bummer Cannot easily replace is Nikon has specialized connections at 12 buck a shot this is not acceptable 
18715 4 Received it on time and was exactly what i was expexting 
18716 0 The balance is not good, The grip is very loose, They should inform buyer you may have balance issue. 
18717 4 Great Product! Came in a timely matter and so far I am very satisfied with this Camera. I m very excited and confident when purchasing from this buyer. 
18718 4 Great filter! I didn t notice any discolorations. 
18719 4 Love my Yongnuos :) fast shipping and awesome product! 
18720 4 Perfect 
18721 4 My Polaroid 100 Land Camera is up and kicking thanks to this. No need for a battery mod. We ll see how long it lasts, though. 
18722 4 This replaced another mount. It is an exact match for another brand. Worked great and at a very good price. 
18723 4 This little camera is awesome!! Great footage 4 wheeling in the woods, crystal clear, picks up all the surrounding sounds 
18724 4 OK it all! 
18725 3 The battery is gerat! However, all the other stuff like the &#34;off-brand&#34; charger can be without. If I had to do it all over again I would get the Nikon Battery & the Nikon Charger to go with it (if it was offered that way). 
18726 4 Does what it should. 
18727 4 Works as expected. Decent build. I don t use it much but it does the job. 
18728 4 Now I am able to film underwater. Yeah! 
18729 4 These are great! I hate fingerprints/smudges on my iPhone and macbook screens. These cloths work great. Love them. 
18730 3 Good lens for the price. If you would liek to save money get this lens 
18731 4 It works great,I like it. I will buy more of it,it helped for recording vedio during my last crusade 
18732 4 It is very good quality! I love it! I just hope they would make it in different colors too. 
18733 4 Everything in it was just what I needed to get started. For the cost of another battery I got got so much more. The case is lightweight and well made. Plenty of room for the camera, spare battery and a few lens covers. 
18734 4 this is one of the better ones I got this to use in case of power outage for use with a portable solar panel it is nice to have the option 
18735 0 The threads for the screw that holds the hot shoe were stripped when it arrived. The screw needs to be longer. Functionally useless, but not worth the cost of shipping to return. 
18736 3 Worked great and was very inexpensive. Leash could be a little longer. 
18737 4 I used some other light diffusers, that worked great but was much bigger, this diffuser works great as well but is much more compact, small and carries a big punch. 
18738 4 Good 
18739 4 Very nice compact tripod. Its a great travel or hiking tripod that can handle moderate weight. 
18740 4 So far I enjoy my little camera. It takes beautiful pictures. No complaints. 
18741 1 It s what I m looking for. But the batteries won t charge. It seems that the charger & battery are not compatible. 
18742 4 item as described 
18743 4 You can shoot a lot more stable on hand held shots. Very comfortable. 
18744 4 Excellent video and easy to use. 
18745 3 ilikeit 
18746 4 Worked well. 
18747 2 Door sensors do NOT work with vera 
18748 1 Could have used some instructions on mounting this plate. 
18749 4 This camdera produces photographs that equal cameras 3 times the cost and with automatic focus and exposure setting. 
18750 4 No complaints 
18751 4 These performed perfectly! 
18752 2 When it s not falling off my camera due to the crap connector, it takes great pics! 
18753 4 Item arrived fast and secure. High quality accessories. 
18754 4 Generally I wouldn t write a review for such an inexpensive item, but I thought I would pass on to anyone considering this that it works perfect for me. I have it on my Canon EOS 70D. I slipped right into the hotshoe and does it s job perfectly. 
18755 2 Excellent visual quality. Plastic screen cracks easily if not secured in shatter proof box when packing in suitcase when traveling. 
18756 4 Great product. I use it on every photo session. Works great 
18757 2 Works great!! 
18758 4 Excellent service. Great product. 
18759 4 Good 
18760 1 S***ty, tinny audio quality. Buy if you love mediocrity. 
18761 4 Loved it! 
18762 4 Works well - did have it jump off the network once and re-establish a connection with a different IP address but was easily fixed. 
18763 4 Excellent item, quick to post, Thanks 
18764 4 Arrived as promised and earlier than I expected. 
18765 3 Didn t line up exactly but we made it work. Excellent quality!! 
18766 4 Love this! Took it snorkeling and parasailing on vacation and it did an awesome job! 
18767 4 Very useful for shots that require a long exposure time and a tripod. Love it! Works perfectly with my Nikon D3200. 
18768 0 the monitoring device stopped workingwith less than 4 months of service 
18769 3 The quality is not quite as good as the real GoPro stuff, but for the price it s definitely worth it, very good value and better quality items than I was expecting. 
18770 4 THIS WAS BETTER THAN I EXPECTED! I want to start up my YouTube channel and I needed a camera to do so :) this one takes incredible videos and audio isn t bad either! 
18771 3 kenneth was great and walked me right through 
18772 3 simple & functional; easy to use 
18773 4 okay. 
18774 4 this is a huge improvement over the standard plastic snap that comes with the case. This will outlive the camera for sure. 
18775 4 Thanks for fast delivery and the best product came in a good way with everything written and shown in the pic 
18776 4 Great battey. Lasts and then some 
18777 3 I was a little worried if it s going to fit around my vanguard tripod, it actually attached snug on the foam part of the leg, only one lever to control both of the angles was not the best, but it got the job done for now... 
18778 4 Giving this 5 stars now because it is a well made product and an excellent value. I revisit this after I see how long the batteries last - that is key! 
18779 4 We got my 13 year old a dslr for her birthday. Needed a fun looking, but sturdy and secure bag. This fit the bill perfectly!! I m a photographer myself and would love one for myself. 
18780 3 Good price vs Nikon product. Nice inclusion of a charger. Theses are small batteries to start with so not spectacular but as good as Nikon. 
18781 4 Work s great. No problems at all, charged the battery quickly. Arrived quickly nicely packaged. 
18782 3 Excellent product at a great price. 
18783 0 Does not fit! Pieces are too tight. 
18784 4 Vincent was very helpful and very patient with me for me not having no knowlege of cumputer and the camera s are great I would highly recomend the camera and again THANK Vincent. 
18785 4 Very comfortable and lightweight! 
18786 4 As promised. 
18787 3 Cool. 
18788 4 Quick delivery and great product 
18789 4 It was quickly delivered. Very good. 
18790 4 I am finally able to carry and store my gopro properly. 
18791 0 I couldn t get it to work 
18792 4 Works great! 
18793 4 10 points. everything was as expected 
18794 2 Toy binoculars! These are okay if you re a kid who wants to use their imagination. These binoculars do not focus very well and I would only recommend them for someone under the age of eight. 
18795 4 Great pack! 
18796 4 works great and cant beat the price 
18797 4 Beautiful photos. So glad I got this filter. 
18798 4 Like the product, Great tech support by Walter 
18799 2 I wear glasses and they some what work out. It s good enough for a substitute. Its annoying adjusting them sometimes. 
18800 4 i love it 
18801 0 Sooooo the cameras are black and white picture with no resolution and they aren t really wireless... Also did not receive the remote needed to control the LCD screen.... We just set them up, and they did not meet my expectations. 
18802 3 Almost perfect. Works fine and all but has a few scratches. I wish it was flawless :I 
18803 0 Sometimes you get what you pay for. If you really want a gopro, buy one. This has everything you need but just doesn t work. I have no memories of my trip because my camera didn t work! 
18804 4 Just a nice lil charger. 
18805 4 Well designed with sturdy pouch. Good value. prompt delivery. 
18806 2 This frame did not fit my GoPro Her 4 all that well, it blocked the shutter button. 
18807 4 These are great. I ve been using these straps with my go pro to record working on a vehicle and the accessibility is awesome 
18808 4 Ok 
18809 4 This camera is SO extraordinary-- I recommend over any other camera on the market-- easy to use, AMAZING sound and video/image quality... And at a reasonable price! I m just super over the moon about it! Also shipped in a secure and expedient manner! THANK YOU!! 
18810 4 Works well and attaches to the lens easily without binding. Be careful not to over tighten. 
18811 4 Ordered this for my daughter She loved it ! Takes the cutest pictures 
18812 4 Very good construction. You can design your own layout as I did to accommodate my Sony NX3 video camera. There are many storage compartments of various configurations to store and organize the way you work. This is a professional bag with the option to shoulder or wheel your equipment. Nice.... 
18813 4 Just what I expetded 
18814 4 Works great 
18815 4 Works exactly as expected. Great product! 
18816 4 I was very pleased with my purchase. It was shipped right away and exceeded my expectations. I will purchase from these guys again. 
18817 3 Good value for the price! 
18818 4 Yes....just what I wanted and expected. Convenient, strong, can be used as a walking stick or a camera monopod. 
18819 4 I love the film for my new camera. Received on time! 
18820 3 Nice system. Not the best but works fine for the size and the cost. 
18821 3 Not bad. So far so good 
18822 4 Awesome. Everyone loves it at parties. 
18823 1 A little loose and comes off sometimes on its own. 
18824 4 Protect your investment and make sure it doesn t sink to the bottom of the ocean. Comes with a new backdoor and everything you need to affix it. 
18825 4 Excellent reasonably priced product from camera producer Nikon. 
18826 4 Henry Campbell helped me figure this thing out. great camera but setup is a doozie. called customer service and sat on hold for a few min and he had it figured out. 
18827 3 I ended up returning this item, because I found one that I liked better, but that was all just preference. It was a good lens, I just decided I would rather have a macro lens. 
18828 3 The soft box is is great quality, the mount was wobbly because the two Philips screws were stripped, i applied some glue and now it is very sturdy. 
18829 2 Not big enough for all my equipment. 
18830 4 Works great, thanks 
18831 4 Great lens but everyone knows that already 
18832 4 I love this!!! Amazing kit 
18833 3 not as tight as expected 
18834 4 great seller - delivered as promised! 
18835 1 Melts when left exposed to the sun! Don t leave your helmet locked to your bike and expect the camera mount to be there when you finish lunch. 
18836 1 over priced period 
18837 4 Great product. I use this as a backdrop for short informational training videos and interviews. Well made and appears it is built to last. 
18838 4 Fantastic deal! Couldn t be more satisfied with this digital camera. For all the accessories you receive along with the camera itself...Best deal we ve ever found on Amazon!! Awesome! 
18839 3 Had to take a file to the plastic mounting foot so it would fit the hotshot on the camera...now it works pretty good. 
18840 4 works well and much less expensive than brand name 
18841 0 Not happy at all. Wrong plug in for US 
18842 3 Comes with everything except the clip for the brim of the baseball cap. Would be nice to have that included. 
18843 4 Great value! 
18844 4 I do enjoy it design and Bluetooth operation and connection. 
18845 4 By far my favorite lens. Quality is crisp and sharp, takes excellent low light photos and depth of field is superb. I would highly recommend this lens 
18846 2 I m confused, some people say yes it does come with an AC power adapter some people say no. Jeff Thoele 
18847 1 I purchased 2 and I need to return one. 1 works fine and one failed to turn on 
18848 3 &#34;Good points Easy setup Well built chassis Long enough power cable&#34; 
18849 4 the best case for a single camera !! 
18850 4 I use my go pro 3+ as a dash cam for my motorcycle trips. Extra charged batteries are a must. This is a great product. 
18851 4 Great Diffuser, I was looking for one that fit my Neewer NW670 / VK750II Not exactly shaped but fits perfect. I definitely recommend it. great product! 
18852 4 Awesome!!! Totally worth the money and I still haven t got to play with everything yet. 
18853 4 Great product, for the price. Worked as advertised. 
18854 4 Worked great. Wish flip was still in business. I would recommend gettng a tripod that has legs that wrap around railings and that are flexible. Otherwise this tripod was perfect. 
18855 3 Seems like a great tripod so far! top notch, with a great bag included. The only thing I miss is an arm to pan. 
18856 3 Rubber strap would ve been easier than Velcro. Kinda hard to fold and put away without loosening Velcro all the way 
18857 4 Everything was as advertised...great way to carry/store GoPro and accessories!!! 
18858 4 Excellent! 
18859 2 Jerks when rotating. 
18860 0 Not even worth one star. Bought this for our cruise and took pictures while snorkeling in Cozumel. Returned home and went to download pictures and they were gone. Can t return for refund because my time limited was up the day we got off of cruise (yesterday). 
18861 4 Very sturdy blocks 
18862 0 The camera I received didn t work I charged it several times even tried a different usb and tried an electrical outlet and it still wouldn t hold charge. 
18863 4 Products are very worth the money. Only object that I don t like/can t use is the tripod, it s very cheap. Other products are on par with GoPro brand products 
18864 3 Great addition to the kit for my Camera. Tripod is a little flimsy, though. You get what you pay for. 
18865 4 fits nice and tight. tighter than stock parts. 
18866 4 Fit great. I feel better knowing my new camera is protected. 
18867 3 Works great, very inexpensive. I used wasabi batteris for my Sony and Canon DSLRs, other brands just cannot match performance and compatibility. 
18868 4 Works just like it shows. 
18869 4 Does the job well... 
18870 3 It works perfectly. 
18871 4 Loving it! 
18872 4 Best suction mount for the GoPro Hero 4. 
18873 0 Don t waste you re time or money. I got it free as a promotional and still feel ripped off. Video is beyond horrible, pictures are un viewable and embarrassing to show to anyone. You would get better video and pictures from an old smoke signal flip phone. 
18874 3 Works great -- I just wish the microphone sound was better quality like D link. Otherwise so far, so good. Great value. 
18875 4 This is a great case. Nicely put together. Of course, every case is particular to your camera and how you like to use it. So I m managing to make it work for me. It can be used in a variety of ways. 
18876 3 Great for travling 
18877 4 Just a good accessory to have. I bought both my grandson and husband one for their Go Pro s. 
18878 3 I had some trouble connecting to my wifi because I use google chrome. Tech support was very helpful. Too bad this doesn t work to watch the outside from behind glass 
18879 4 great buy, good price. 
18880 3 works great! 
18881 4 Works as described. 
18882 3 Pretty easy to use, but you have to make sure the images are the proper size or else it stretch and distorts the image. 
18883 3 Title says it all 
18884 0 Grandson s Christmas present. Wasn t really submersible. 
18885 4 Way better than the generic ones... spend the extra. 
18886 1 Does NOT come with memory card. 
18887 3 I m very happy with the case. It fits perfectly and the strap is a perfect length too. I will defanetly recommend this case to anyone. 
18888 4 A++ 
18889 4 Just what I expected 
18890 3 It fit my Audi perfect. The price was lot better then dealers. 
18891 4 After experimenting with different bags this is the perfect bag. I really feel my camera gear is safe and secure. 
18892 4 Superb lens. Lovely bokeh, sharp even at f/1.4. Nice colors and contrast. 
18893 1 Its started to getting hanged while recording. Media card is not read properly. Lost some images also 
18894 3 I would have give 5 stars BUT, it missing one memory card. Everything else was good, delivered on time and well packed. 
18895 3 After receiving my replacement stick I m quite impressed not so happy with the part that hold the phone. I find the spring to be a bit cumbersome but overall it does its job. 
18896 4 Awesome is about all I need to say the constriction is solid and out has good features I have a mini ball pivot on top, with a Canon sx50 camera and it supports it easily I really Like this for shooting on the go very stable base 
18897 4 Excellent product, fast shipping. Buy without hesitation. 
18898 4 ok 
18899 4 Thanks for the fast shipping. Looking forward to future business. Also it was an easy install and works great!! 
18900 4 More than I expected and better quality could have hope for. 
18901 4 This is exactly what I was looking for to be able to take pictures on the water with out the glare off the water. 
18902 2 hard to manuevar 
18903 2 Fantastic filter but Does not work with 24-105 canon 
18904 4 Very easy to apply. 
18905 4 Good value for the size and quality. Outside is hard enough to protect against normal wear and tear and traveling and inside foam pockets have a versatility of use. 
18906 4 Fair Price good Product 
18907 4 Love the gimbal, works great, the app could be better. 
18908 4 Beautiful and functional custom soft release button. Expensive but well worth it. Has an rubber O ring that keeps the button from unscrewing, unlike the cheap plastic soft release buttons. Highly recommended. 
18909 1 Initially, it is only OK for a emergency situation as backup to take a few more shots. After a while completely useless. I have had my original Canon battery twice as long and it is still going strong. 
18910 4 Very useful tripod and great value. Give it a shot! 
18911 4 Very good quality film 
18912 4 fit perfectly and happy with the purchase. 
18913 4 Works great with my D3300. Just turn it on in the camera s menu and push the button. I believe this to be a camera thing, but you must focus the scene using the camera s shutter button ahead of time. 
18914 4 Great item just what I was looking for. 
18915 4 No problems with it yet.. everything fits fine. Good price too. 
18916 4 Excellent price and very fast shipping 
18917 0 not a clear view distributor, not a new product, product is not under warranty. call clearview direct 
18918 0 Battery did not fit Had to be returned 
18919 3 I don t want to give a bad review because it wouldn t work with my NVR system (Q-SEE QC838) My mistake for not checking the right specs! 
18920 4 nice 
18921 4 It s a high quality material , easy to use, perfect size for shot a portray. 
18922 4 It s amazing..we loved it.. 
18923 3 Works great 
18924 4 Quick delivery, item just as described. 
18925 3 Not a toy. Need to get used to it. Learn how to fly it 
18926 0 How do turn. On the camera 
18927 3 I really like it but the diffuser fabric is already starting to pull away from the seams. 
18928 4 Camera take great videos. Came with lots o accessories. Waterproof case works great. Great camera for the price. You can click on the links below to view sample videos. Sample Video @ 1080p/60fps daytime: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpDS_aVjA5Q https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZ4A19GoEFk Sample Video @ 1080p/60fps at night https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UQICoPTPlw 
18929 4 Shipped fast and amazing quality! 
18930 4 I love B&W product 
18931 0 REALLY BAD, THE THREAD FOR THE SCREW IS MADE IN PLASTIC, AS SOON YOU MOVE IT WILL BRAKE APART...DONT BUY THIS EVER !! 
18932 3 great little flying machine for the price. It s a great little quad to learn on. I originally got a dud but the company had great customer service and sent me a new one. This one flies perfectly. It can handle good bumps and crashes as well. 
18933 2 My Yongnuo YN600EX-RT does not work as Nikon Slave in iTTL mode, firmware version 1.8.3, anyone face the same problem. Nikon Slave M mode was working well. 
18934 4 Absolulty love it and I recieved it quick 
18935 4 Time saver. Easy to use. Nice and bright. Has audio too! 
18936 4 B+W is a trusted brand and first class product. 
18937 4 super easy to use. Works GREAT. 
18938 4 This cover will be perfect for my Peerless watercolors. Oh and I did get 2 in the pack! 😊 
18939 2 Well I bought mine for YouTube and I think the video quality is amazing but talking thru it isn t and it sounds like I m a far distance away so that s very disappointing. Taking photos with it is okay but in probably going to take it back ! 
18940 4 Better specs than the OEM item. No issues with charging or delivery. 
18941 3 The product was described as having no damages except a small scratch, but the automatic cover does not open or close all the way. I can easily push it down with my fingernail so it doesn t bother me. Especially since this was offered at such a fantastic price. 
18942 4 Exactly the product I need. This is very useful and the quality is outstanding. Gives me the angles that I need especially when doing outdoor shots,group pictures. Holds my big IPhone tightly without worry. Price is very reasonable and delivers swiftly. 
18943 2 Very good quality case just like my Lowepro sling bag. However, this is just not a fast out great travel case like I have for my old film cameras. Nothing wrong with the bag, but I don t love it like I do my sling Lowepro. 
18944 4 Works great and costs much, much, much less than a Canon original. Awesome. 
18945 2 Seems solid. Just didn t trust it for my SLR. Wife has it on her pocket cam know. 
18946 4 Just I hoped. Great deal 
18947 4 Easy to install and operate, good quality, functional. 
18948 4 Great amazon purchase! Thanks. 
18949 4 Good basic wired remote 
18950 4 so far so good 
18951 3 very good 
18952 4 excelente 
18953 0 Made of very cheap materials. The Velcro is barely on. The design does not allow for it to be angled down. 
18954 4 good so far learning it with flash kit 
18955 3 Was perfect but had some white spots 
18956 4 Great except for the swivel lightening shoe that broke hopefully the replacement does not brake! 
18957 3 It works fine 
18958 4 Pricey but got my Canon EOS Rebel up and running. 
18959 3 Good product 
18960 1 This item only came with the speed ring insert and not the actual speed ring as shown in the photo of the product. 
18961 4 Excellent and fast shipping 
18962 3 Very much like the camera. Four stars for not great anti-shake capabilities. 
18963 3 It works well. Sometimes, it is difficult to place though. 
18964 4 Came fast and work as expected. 
18965 3 Works well. I get two days of hard use with it with my Sony DCR-SR45 camcorder. 
18966 4 excellent 
18967 4 Does just what you need it to. Count only goes up to 399 but you can set it to go forever if you need more exposures. It won t work for exposures less than a second long. 
18968 4 Old GPS quit working, so the drone quit flying. After many minutes of trouble shooting and youtube videos thought that i would start with this bugger. Worked like a charm. Fairly easy to get to and replace (even for someone with big hands). 
18969 4 Bought this as a present for my father. This device was his first experience with a &#34;smart camera&#34; with a touch screen. It took a few days but he has become quite the wiz at using it, editing pictures and videos, etc. Basically this was a huge hit. 
18970 4 This monopod is definitely lightweight and durable.... Had it for about a few months, and no problems yet! There really isn t anything else that is worth saying, because this product is exactly what it says in the descriptions! No lies or anything. 
18971 4 Happy that I purchased this package will now have extras on hand 
18972 4 purchased for my wife in 2010 and its easy to use and takes great pictures 
18973 0 bad design, when power on P3 yr gimbal will hit it. 
18974 4 Worked out great. A little noisy but okay. 
18975 0 Shooting even a few minutes of video drains the battery. The regular Canon battery, though it has lower capacity, has no problem doing such short clips. Fully charged battery, two or three minute clip, first the battery warning, then the camera shuts down. Returned it. 
18976 4 perfect. 
18977 2 My son enjoyed this for 1.5 days and then it broke after hitting a tree branch. Needs to be more durable. 
18978 4 This case does fit the old/outdated Magellan 6000T with room for the AC adapter. 
18979 2 Good price, but not for the model television listed. Bulb can be carefully removed and placed in housing from old bulb 
18980 4 such a great case. goes well with my pink camera. 
18981 4 This case is fantastic. It fits all of my extras in here along with my new Gopro Hero 4 Silver. Very happy with this purchase and the price was great too. 
18982 0 Looks like a simple cradle but I really can t write anything about it because I didn t have a need for it as a result of returning Removu RM-R1. 
18983 3 The only problem that I had with this is if you utilise other products - such as the Vello Snap-On LCD Screen Protector - it does not fit well.Without any other attachments works well. 
18984 4 Works great! Easily adjusted and the positions are solid. Great little tripod. 
18985 4 Everything works exactly as advertised; the colors on the monitor are accurate and sharp. I also use it on my tv. (my tv runs off a 2nd computer) Easy to use, nothing else. It s awesome. 
18986 3 Great camera, works perfect. I only wish it was a bit more compact. 
18987 4 Works perfectly. Delivered exactly as promised. Vendor was very responsive and easy to contact and work with! 
18988 4 Excellent product. Very happy with the quality and craftsmanship. 
18989 2 It works as advertised. I lost the directions and forgot how to use it. 
18990 4 Nice! 
18991 4 Great for taking wildlife shots. 
18992 4 Will they come back ? I need some more 
18993 3 I have been using these tubes for a couple of years now. They aren t fancy but they get the job done. You can do really quite amazing stuff with them. I shot a video recently about how to use them. https://youtu.be/qtW4uCNjqzU 
18994 4 As a long term DIY video home security guy I have purchased many different cameras. If these led illum. has as a long life then this is the best in my experience. 
18995 3 Good photos, was a gift for a 7 year old child. Only downside is lack of a rechargeable battery. 
18996 4 very good material 
18997 3 Works just fine for the job 
18998 4 Works great and is very useful. Came when promised 
18999 4 Works as advertised 
19000 4 On time, as advertised, with contact info if needed. A great value. 
19001 3 Great product with excellent support 
19002 4 Very good, I like the camera! 
19003 4 Great speaker. Thanks 
19004 4 Really good product. Velcro makes the fit snug and secure. Only tried it on around the house but think it s going to be great while hiking and dirtbiking. 
19005 4 Works perfectly in my camera. 
19006 4 Built like a tank, durable, the pinnacle of B+W quality. 
19007 4 Its exactly what I needed 
19008 4 Pelican cases are fantastic! The pre-cut perforations make customization easy. They really protect whatever you put in them. I live in the desert, where very fine dust is the issue, but I have to believe that if our fine dust stays out, so will rainwater. 
19009 4 Fantastic, customizable. I keep my GoPro cameras and accessories in this. It s perfect for bringing the cameras to some other location or just to bring everything to the garage without juggling a bazillion expensive gadgets. 
19010 4 Works great! 
19011 4 simple to use and works well 
19012 3 Straps are a little thin and the rubber bottom hits me in the small of my back. Otherwise it is a great product with good protection and storage. 
19013 3 cant compete with the Canon dslr in quality but its still a very good camcorder .easy to set up and quick too .you can always make up for the quality during Editting .so? 
19014 4 The picture quality is great. I use it mostly as a dash cam. The screen is real small and I have not been successful with connecting to wi-fi. 
19015 3 Good uv filter for panasonic lx100 
19016 4 its an awesome camera 
19017 4 Good product 
19018 0 Falls out easily. 
19019 4 Good product and nice price 
19020 4 great product and fast delivery! 
19021 3 Good, compact, powerful, simple scope. Not working with Windows 7 though. Only XP.... 
19022 3 These are small, which is specified and what they are meant to be. They are much easier to take along than a large grey card. The only problem is learning how to use a smaller card which is user error, nothing that the card did. 
19023 0 Its too small and feels like it is going to brake :( 
19024 4 the best low coast drone out there. great trainer... for the money, its the way to go.... 
19025 4 Great product ... Exactly what I needed 
19026 4 Very nice light weight case. Plenty of storage areas for batteries and accessories, and fits the Phantom 3 Professional with prop guards perfectly. A bit pricey but worth 5 stars for quality. 
19027 3 great buy 
19028 3 For the price it s hard to beat. I plan to sell it to upgrade to a 70 200 in the near future though 
19029 4 good 
19030 4 Does exactly what I wanted it to do -- for my GoPro... Easy to use. 
19031 3 Easy to use and does well as a cary along quick clean. 
19032 4 Great lens ! Great price 
19033 2 good idem 
19034 3 good product 
19035 4 This is one of those things that I hope I never see how well it works. 
19036 4 Exactly what I was looking for 
19037 4 I have zero complaints. This tripod is easily the best I ve owned and it feels so solid. 
19038 4 Love it. 
19039 2 Cool 
19040 4 I was worried about the film being left in warm conditions but it develops perfectly and looks great. Film was within use by date. 
19041 4 Great product easy to use, works as designed. 
19042 0 Not what I spected for $24.00 dollars. ...one sheet of badays plastic, I ended buying a cell phone screen protector it work bettet.. 
19043 4 Great for selfies and tripod videos from different heights and angles. 
19044 4 Just what we expected! 
19045 3 Great product for the price!! 
19046 4 Worked like a charm! 
19047 4 Good product 
19048 4 The camera is outstanding so far, sharp images at day and at night. Worths the money! 
19049 2 Doesn t fit my Nixon Coolpix cameras eye holes at all. Much too wide to slide into slits. 
19050 2 This is NOT a neck-strap! Don t be fooled. Def a great shoulder strap though. 
19051 4 I use my own tote bags and just move this from purse to purse when I need my camera. Love it! 
19052 4 Works like a charm with both my Neweer units and both d5100 and d7100 bodies. 
19053 3 I wish the batteries came with the protective plastic cases like they have with past orders 
19054 4 Inexpensive, but works perfectly...charging the batteries a little faster than the charger that came with the camera. Excellent product at an excellent price. 
19055 4 Works great. I use it attached to the end of my pole and it is able to hold it up. 
19056 3 I bought my first tripod Its good I like I saw many videos before buying it The only reason i am giving 4 stars is the one button to open it wide was coming off the body So i have to glue it and now it cant use wide legs 
19057 2 Too big ....need a smaller version with the same loudness. Something you can comfortably fit in a pants pocket 
19058 4 A must have for the extra chargers to keep at the ready. 
19059 4 Arrived fast, easy to attach to my T3i 
19060 4 Love the look at night. The adhesive on the lights could be better. I had to tape it to keep it on. 
19061 4 Using this in several trips abroad = quality product that is worth a few extra dollars. 
19062 4 Great item! 
19063 4 Great quality. Sturdy and seals perfect. 
19064 4 Work Pefect 
19065 4 No problems with product and/or delivery. Works as described. 
19066 4 Everything arrived ok! Great product. 
19067 4 Absolutely perfect. This is a steal for the price that it s at. I highly recommend it. It comes in a little case, so you can put it in there without worrying about it getting scratched up. As someone who is experimenting with long exposures, this was a great lens. 
19068 4 Good quality definitely! They have nice little details. The elastic fabric (I dont know the technical term) feels so soft but firm. They have the non-slip coding, which makes the firming pretty steady. 
19069 4 These are such AWESOME lights. I use them when I film my YouTube videos and they make my videos so much better when it comes to lighting. 
19070 3 Backdrop is good for the price that you pay. The screen sizes are very misleading as the picture makes it seem like it is meant for a larger screen but they are relatively small sized. 
19071 4 Fast delivery and works fine 
19072 1 The screw and metal loop on the bottom started rusting right away. 
19073 4 Works perfectly! 
19074 2 I just bought this camera and i dived for 21 meters and when i went out it does not work anymore.. 
19075 4 Awesome flash for the features and the price. Works great with my 70D! 
19076 4 I use this for all my batterys and it works perfect with no problems Will recommend this to anyone 
19077 0 not to work never got chance try until to late to send back 
19078 4 Great for travel and makes all your shots even better...was unsure what to expect but love them. Got it as a gift for my sister, said they were amazing and worked on both iphone and ipad, Would buy again! 
19079 4 Seems to sometimes not work with my android (it looks like this is ONLY capable with android phones) but I think it might just be me...so far I really like it! 
19080 0 thought it came with a sd card , did not explane well and i could get better quality from an old phone camera do not buy this. 
19081 4 Really helps with low and high angle composition 
19082 4 Very useful & practical size. 
19083 4 So much more reach than the prior 11-16. So bright , so clear. Almost no distortion so little or no software correction when processing in Lightroom. Wonderful for taking pictures in the forest. I photograph sun rays in fog and see none of the flare reported in prior copies. 
19084 4 Factory product, quickly delivered. 
19085 3 perfeito pelo preço 
19086 4 Great travel camera. Takes two AAs so it s ready to go when you are, no need to charge before you go to that important event. 
19087 3 I bought this to store my new ViewSonic PJD5255L video projector. Even though it is designed to be more of a camera and lens case, It fits perfectly. Only complaint is the plastic hinges and latches don t seem too sturdy And may wear out if used often.. 
19088 4 Nice product and it just works! 
19089 0 would not focus correctly 
19090 4 This is a small company that offers a quality product and really extraordinary customer service. I rarely have the time to write recommendations. MooJou Enterprises moved me to make the time. 
19091 4 I bought this as a birthday present. The preteen loved it. I think it might have been her favorite gift. 
19092 4 Item arrived as promised (very fast). They also included a 32gb micro Sd card (thank you). Definitely would purchase again and will look here for any accessories. 
19093 4 Fast and Very Early. I have a lot time in my hands to finish the preparations on my Son s Birthday 
19094 4 What a great price. 290 refurbished is the way to go. !! Searched everywhere for the best deal and im pretty satisfied. I still need to mess with the camera a little more to learn more about it but overall im liking it :) 
19095 2 Quality great but disappointed about the print direction. It doesn t state it will be portrait printed. The picture of the item shows it to be landscape which what is needed and would work best for pictures. 
19096 4 As advertised. Works great. Short delivery time. 
19097 3 Had to send one back to HTC due to water getting into the unit. Will be trying it in water again soon, as that is one reason I got this. However they replaced without issues. 
19098 4 Works like a charm 
19099 4 It is definitely a good buy with the bag that I bought to place it in. 
19100 4 Fits my Fujifilm and 2 lenses well. Build quality is solid. 
19101 4 I got the item on time and nothing damaged. It is all they said it would be. I lreally like it 
19102 4 i took this to a trip in Rocky Mountain, mounted D7000+17-55 f2.8 (quite heavy combo) to it. Surprisingly, this little guy is very sturdy and the ball head is very easy to use, and I enjoyed it a lot. 
19103 3 Works well. Would get a &#34;I LOVE IT&#34; rating if it was not so heavy. 
19104 4 Arrived on time and as described. I have yet to really test the product but so far so good. 
19105 4 excellent product! meets and beats the quantum tubos at 75% less cost. And I use them in the harshest environment of all. underground photography all over North America! www.dupontphotography.com for examples of the work. 
19106 3 i would have preferred the VR mode in addition to auto and manual 
19107 4 works good 
19108 4 These float wristbands for holding camera are great. they have enough size and float capability to keep any small waterproof camera from sinking. Plus, they provide excellent cushioning when in a camera bag. 
19109 2 Fast delivery. Heats up a bit. 
19110 2 It broke really soon, on/off button did not work in some months. 
19111 4 Pretty good item Work great and nice 
19112 4 Great little video camera. Easy to use and great picture quality. I bought this off of Amazon Warehouse and got a great deal. 
19113 4 Perfect. I love it so much. Super cute, colorful and trustworthy 
19114 4 Really nice quality photos! My room is very dark and normally when I take photos, they tend to be really dark and unappealing. With this lens, it really does make all the difference in color and clarity wise!! Definitely recommend. 
19115 4 Use it for an exercise device. Great power saver. 
19116 3 Great little flash dose a wonderful job very easy to use and understand no unnecessary mumbojumbo. 
19117 2 there were a few useful items and other things i ll probably never use. Bt considering the low price, the useful items seem well made and they make the package worthwhile. 
19118 4 Fit great, feel great, and work great. 
19119 0 too small. 
19120 4 This tripod worked great for me, fits all me phones including big ones like Samsung Notes. Great value. 
19121 4 Nice for off iPhone flash. 
19122 4 works exactly as advertised, and very reasonably priced. using it with a Canon 7D 
19123 0 Camera did not take pictures or movies when installed. It registered on the controller and the light showed camera active, but no video could be played. 
19124 4 Nice just as they said 
19125 4 Just got one and it works as advertised. Easy to use. Easy to set up. Very helpful as we travel a lot and will be able to keep an eye on our home. Might add a way you can also connect through a laptop. 
19126 3 actually has three mounts! 
19127 3 It works for personal use, no complaints for the price. 
19128 4 excellent product for the price 
19129 3 Make sure u update to 3.0 for 1080 60fps 
19130 4 Wow! Very impressed at the quality of this item. I looked at many other versions and am HAPPY to have selected this one. You will love it! 
19131 4 Great ball head I use this for real estate shooting on the manfortto pro 55 legs and the two fit together like bread and butter. No need to spend more for exotic materials. This combination gets the job done with flying colors. 
19132 4 Excellent camera and price. 
19133 2 cheap. good deal for what it is. 
19134 4 Love this camera and the price was great! The quality of the pictures is amazing and this is easy to use! 
19135 4 This is the best digital photo frame I ve ever owned. Pictures are crystal clear and fill as much of the screen as possible. Very little effort to set up also. Thanks, I love it!! 
19136 4 Ok 👌 
19137 3 Its an exceptionally solid FF for its price. Maybe a little heavy against the lightweight cameras it will likely be attached to. 
19138 2 Nice while it worked. I sent it in to be repaired and learned the repair cost was more than what I paid for the camera. 
19139 3 Great item - good price. Thanks! 
19140 4 Best grip for rollercoasters video 
19141 4 love it but i lost it:( 
19142 3 No issues, it is was it says. 
19143 0 Charger didn t work 
19144 3 This lens is compact, light weight and always come handy. 
19145 4 Unbelievable quality!! Super slim. Amazing clairity. Hoya- B+W- throw them away. If you are reading this - do yourself a favor and click purchase now. I received no incentives for this review - only read the review and agreed. You need this lens. You want this lens!! 
19146 1 Very cheaply made. My granddaughter dropped it by accident and now there is a lens error and the lens won t open so can not take pictures. It is a waste, now. 
19147 3 Good camera at a reasonable price. You really can t go wrong with a PowerShot from Canon. This is actually my 4th one over the years. This model is nice and light and only requires two batteries. The quality of images are great and it s easy to use. 
19148 2 It s OK! Seems kinda useless. 
19149 0 Coats 6$ to return 
19150 3 Great accessory kit. The kit comes with more items than I know what do with them My only complaint is the camera doesn t fit snug in case. I am pleased with kit and would do business with seller again 
19151 4 excellent! 
19152 2 The cap fits fine, but the adhesive for the strap was completely dry and useless. Super glue took care of it easily however. 
19153 4 Everyone knows GoPro is at the top of the Sports/Action Cams. Best camera quality, lots of customization for settings and all around amazing piece of technology. 
19154 4 buuenas camaras 
19155 4 Great thanks! 
19156 4 Works good 
19157 0 I am rather disappointed as the Camera does not appear to have night vision or it is certainly not working. what are my alternatives as I desperately require night vision on my camera. All of my Logitech cameras have night vision and are very clear at nights except this one.???????? 
19158 4 Easy to install. Fit perfect and waterproof. All I can ask for $6 
19159 4 looks real 
19160 4 Is great!!! 
19161 4 nice 
19162 4 charger looked great shipping on point- but due to my own error it was thew wrong one and i had to return it 
19163 4 Soft-sided but very well made. I love the bag and use it every day to carry my K-3II with a 24mm Sigma lens and my lunch to my office. A+++ 
19164 0 This thing is useless. Doesn t work at all. It worked, marginally, for a day or so, then stopped all together. Changed the battery for a new one-still nothing. Zero stars. 
19165 2 Pro: Light and compact Easily adjustable/remove Con: Lack of padding makes uncomfortable after long day if you have a dslr w/battery grip and heavy lens 
19166 3 This item is sturdy and very easy to set up. 
19167 1 I think it would work great if you had sent instruction I could understand. You need to get someone who speaks fluent English to write your instructions. Please send them to me. I cannot use the camera because I cannot understand how to set it. 
19168 4 bang for your buck and still have the whole set going strong. if you take care of it it will last you. very good especially for a starter set in flash photography! 
19169 4 It works. My camera will float. That s all I ask of something like this. 
19170 0 did not work for me with GoPro black and fatshark... could not get video signal. Played around but it never worked. 
19171 4 Great product and great price. Highly recommended 
19172 4 New version of the Fuifilm NP-45 Lithium Ion Rechargeable battery worked as it should. I was disappointed in discovering my old battery charger for the older version of this battery isn t the one recommended for this new version. 
19173 4 I have bought these before, in a 100 pack. Now just hoping there be enough. Well made, no problems. Little slow on shipping. 
19174 4 Skeptical, due to price. Read previous reviews here & decided to buy. Great bargain. So happy I gave it a go 
19175 4 Good protection wish it came in different colors. 
19176 1 after less then 3 days of owner ship the eyepiece will no longer adjust for power setting. 
19177 4 Excellent! 
19178 4 Excellent service, nice product 
19179 3 Easy to use with auto settings, fun to experiment with advanced features. Great camera for the price. 
19180 4 I bought one for my girls but have been using it quite a bit for myself. Good quality and works really well. Love it!!! 
19181 4 works great 
19182 4 Works as promised. Excellent produce at a fair price. 
19183 0 One of the packs was damaged and it comes out filled with ink! 
19184 4 Great buy love my gopro!! The extra batteries come in handy 🙌🏼🙌🏼 
19185 4 For years I had wanted a Nikon and when I purchased the D3100 I was not disappointed. Great camera for amateurs like me. 
19186 4 as described 
19187 4 Really good camera. i took it on my trips over seas and took some amazing shots. I am not a professional photographer so this camera helped in making my shots better. 
19188 4 Everything arrived as described. Thanks so much!! 
19189 1 Short shaft. Didn t fit right. 
19190 3 Very appropiate for the Go pro cam and it´s accessories. 
19191 4 Works like a champ 
19192 0 This is the third one I ve bought and none of them work. They only work for the first 5 minutes you have it going. I kept buying them because they are cheap and I thought maybe I was just having bad luck. But nope, they just don t work. 
19193 3 Good product, will not lose/break your camera--just as soon as GoPro original accessories. I just wish there were extra screws in package--lost one almost immediate upon arrival! 
19194 1 It s ok 
19195 0 Not what I wanted! 
19196 1 Works fine. 
19197 0 Not working as well as when new.. 
19198 0 Don t like it like the white one better 
19199 0 The camera that was supposed to have come new was used and had damage ax they left the batteries inside the camera and the had fallen out and rattled in the box leaving dents and chips in the camera body. 
19200 3 Works well 
19201 4 Purchased this for my son s Gopro, he loves it. Makes it easier when fishing and hunting. 
19202 4 Good quality handy, collapsible white balance reference reflector. Easy to stick in the camera bag so no excuse to not carry it all the time. 
19203 0 Excellent product BUT terrible smell of leather which was not possible to remove at all by several known methods 
19204 4 Amazing for the price! Haven t failed me yet! 
19205 4 works as advertised... 
19206 4 I love, love, love having this when I have to shoot a busy baby or toddler. I can turn on my phones front facing camera and they can make faces at themselves or turn on a favorite movie. Great product. 
19207 3 Super easy to install. The material looks real from a distance but once close and when you have it on your hands, it s a very cheap plastic material. 
19208 4 This is an excellent product. Well made and well worth the money. Perfect for my Nikon 3300. 
19209 4 These are replacements for my old ones and worked perfectly! 
19210 4 I will recommend to my friends as it came quickly, looks nice, video quality is great. 
19211 4 excelent 
19212 4 Pricey but works as it should. 
19213 1 Work, but when my camera given that still has 20 % of the load suddenly goes off and makes me lose Scenes 
19214 4 Excellent product and fast delivery 
19215 3 A good medium range lens. On the Sony Nex7 I found results very good. 
19216 4 goes with the camera 
19217 4 original fit, and perfect ability 
19218 4 I love this camera. Very easy to use. Favorite part is the instruction book that gives tips on taking better pics. 
19219 4 C6722043 TECH ID AR004273 My customer service personnel was friendly and helpful. Thank you D-link for providing me with the safety I deserve with a &#34;very&#34; small business. 
19220 4 I purchased this as a gift for a relative last Christmas. I was blown away by the quality. Great bag for the price. 
19221 4 Great 
19222 4 This was a purchase for myself and I have found it as advertised and a good purchase. The seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with. 
19223 4 The camera was shipped promptly. I have only used it a little bit, but so far it works like a charm. Takes photos quickly and they look great! Very easy to use and so lightweight... 
19224 3 Love it.. bought it due to the one that came in the box was always out. After the replacement I got up to 4 hours without any issue. 2 hours each battery shipped. 
19225 4 Worked just fine.!!! Perfect. 
19226 4 great lens. i use it for northern lights photography and it works really well for capturing landscape. 
19227 2 poor signal very difficult to connect to wifi... 
19228 4 A very nice frame. works well; nice size to have. I am well pleased with product. 
19229 0 Garbage, don t waste your money or time. 
19230 4 Great lens for starting out! 
19231 4 Easy to install, The design is attractive for a sensor. I haven t had the opportunity to see it in action and I hope I never do. 
19232 4 Camera is great and the bundle is a good deal. I love the hero 4 silver. 
19233 0 Not compatible with Nikon D5200. The product description is misleading in mentioning that the product is compatible with all 5000 series DSLRs 
19234 4 A really excellent camera that is wonderful to operate. I m a bit angry that 2 months later there is an updated version that I wish I had. 
19235 4 Very expensive, but it works right, and now I have two. I still wish I could sell the camera for nearly what I paid for it, though. 
19236 4 We haves bunch of these around the house. Like, 5 or so. Weekend have one outside, protected from the rain, in Miami- no issues. 
19237 1 I like it ,but after the first pic it start to shot black (blank) pics. 
19238 4 great product! 
19239 4 Great to have on had in case you forget one or don t have it attached to the bottom of your camera. Looks like original MEFOTO. 
19240 3 As advertised. 
19241 4 Great! Well designed, had room for camera w/ lens plus two addition lenses, flash, accessories, with some room left over. Lots of adjustment on the partitions, a big plus. Just wished it had a chest strap between the shoulder straps. 
19242 4 It flies so easily! Controls are not too confusing for first timers either. 
19243 4 PERFECT. 
19244 1 Turned out not needing The binoculars came with a nice strap. 
19245 4 I got this to shoot video reviews and blog posts. After reading reviews about the knock-off versions, I decided to spend a little more to get the real thing. Also, I love that I can hang my phone upside down or mount it somewhere if needed. 
19246 4 This is the first accessory that I purchased for my GoPro 4 camera. It is easy to put on...easy to attach the camera to the Chest Mount. And, it is sturdy and comfortable to wear. 
19247 3 Good, works perfect but a little pricy 
19248 4 works great, easy to use 
19249 4 Hoya glass is the best. This is a great variable nd filter for video. I ve used it several times now and have never noticed any diminished quality to what I m shooting. 
19250 4 I loved this camera outfit, great product for a great price. Loved the accessories that came in package, liked having everything I need in one deal, easier shopping. Now just to learn how to use it. It takes good pics. 
19251 4 I have used their outdoor camera for years, excellent product. Customer service is also very good--Walter helped me diagnose and fix a minor problem in no time at all; also very courteous. 
19252 4 saved my lens when i dropped it on gravel. 
19253 3 This filter was about 3 stops darker than the ICE 10 stop. Well worth the money. 
19254 0 It was the wrong item and was returned. 
19255 4 After purchasing the Yongnuo YN600EX-RT, I ordered this unit, hoping that it would work. It fits the Yongnuo YN600EX-RT perfectly. I ll probably be picking up a few more Yongnuo YN600EX-RT units, so I ll definitely get more of these Sto-Fen Omni-Bounce units as well. 
19256 4 Very nice quality!! 
19257 4 We love it. Works great. 
19258 4 Does just what I wanted it to do. Makes preparing the camera gimbal for flight easier than the included DJI camera lock. Love the bright color and lens cap. 
19259 4 This is another stand i ve added to my collection of other LimoStudio stands. Cant beat the price and service of these stands. Stoked on this purchase and previous LimoStudio products. Steven Caro SCg Shoe Co 
19260 4 This is easily 1/4 the price you would pay for the same amount of product from any photo equipment site on the internet. Fits easily in a backpack and is an amazing tool. 
19261 4 battery charger works like a charm, I love it 
19262 4 Nice stuff, cleans with no residue. 
19263 2 It is a super long lanyard so I feel like the gopro could hit the ground and then be dragged. 
19264 2 Quality light but the boom stand was poorly design. Over all OK for the price. 
19265 1 The lights are weak, the stands are s***. The best parts are the umbrellas, but especially the bag. It s become my go to case for stands. 
19266 4 Looks good and will do a good job. Is closest fit that I could find for my phone. 
19267 4 Great idea and works flawlessly. Very snug and comfortable and easy to use. Cheap too :). 
19268 4 I use primarily for above and below water deep sea fishing photos/videos with my GoPro Hero 4+. It s strong, light, and easily transportable. 
19269 4 battery charges and holds its charge works well 
19270 4 Excellent product. Rubberized, finger grips, easy mount system. 
19271 4 Easy to use, like!! 
19272 4 Takes great photos and HD video! Love the way it feels in my hands This is my 3rd Sony camera in 8 years - however they are more point and shoot cameras....but I do still use all three of them. 
19273 0 Does not fit 1.25 scope I repeat DOES NOT FIT 1.25 SCOPE.The specs do state dimensions as 2&#34; but also states fits any 1.25 scope.I feel it was wishful thinking on my part but really bummed out my crystal clear night sky. 
19274 4 Rock solid! Best tripod I have ever owned! Worth every penny. There is nothing about this tripod that I don t love. 
19275 1 Good build quality, but did not fit my Sigma 50mm 1.4 lens, despite the listed technical specifications indicating it would. 
19276 4 Great filter...is very much as promised by the manufacturer...I have the X1UV and it is just as good. 
19277 3 Excellent flash. I love it. 
19278 4 Works great 
19279 4 The extra large cleaning clothes seem easier to use and clean better than the smaller size. 
19280 0 Easily hackable. I had the camera on one day and it started moving. Someone had hacked it and was panning my living room. Creepy. Never plugged it in again. 
19281 1 Definitely dont hold a charge near as long as a nikon battery but it does a good job if your photo shoot is short otherwise without backup, your photo shoot will indeed be short lived. 
19282 4 It does what it s intended to do, hold my cam nice and steady! 
19283 1 Light is green as hell, but look how cheap it is! 
19284 4 This film is great and the photos come out perfect. I m still learning with my mini8 camera, but this film is perfect. 
19285 4 good 
19286 1 The screws popped out of a couple of accessories almost immediately. 
19287 4 my granddaughter (13) loves it 
19288 4 love it - nice and sturdy. thank you! 
19289 4 Very good product for the price. I would buy it again 
19290 4 Love the ease of using this camera! 
19291 3 I have purchased 2 of these cameras. They are very easy to set up and I can view and point from my android phone. 
19292 3 Great price. Not sure yet of the quality of pictures. 
19293 4 Yes it saved my life from spending money on that bitch I found her sleeping with other guys , so I dump her , I m so happy today ,thanks again a lot 
19294 4 great 
19295 4 I bought it for my wife as a gift, she is the camera hobbyist, she loves it so much, it adding to the quality of the pictures so much, also very easy storage, isn t bulky, nice case 
19296 0 The instruction are vague and you need more than what comes in the package to install it. 
19297 4 Batteries work flawlessly! Fantastic purchase, especially for the price. 
19298 4 Worked perfect 
19299 4 so far it is performing as I hoped 
19300 4 So impressed with this product! Easy setup and works like a charm. Didn t anticipate this, but I love the 24 hour activity log I can review on my phone. Even when I don t have the alarm engaged, I have a sense of what s going on. 
19301 4 Works as advertised. Very sensitive to sound. Works great with Foscam fi9805W. 
19302 3 excellent product will have to get more 
19303 4 works as expected 
19304 4 Great accessory kit with just about everything you could need for your gopro! 
19305 4 Fit device 
19306 4 great camera for young filmmakers starting out i just used this camera for a short film and it worked perfect id buy it again if i have to 
19307 4 For the price this can not be beat. I use it with my Note 4 and have no issues. I am very happy with it. Holds the phone secure and has plenty of adjustments. 
19308 4 Quality product! The white parts are grippy so that you can hang the tripod virtually anywhere, although you need to take some time to make sure it s balanced because the camera s weight will throw it off and might fall 
19309 4 great 
19310 0 malisimo 
19311 2 Not sure if it the stick or not but my mom that lives in Ark. Can t seem to get it to hold the phone. I live in a different state so I can t help her. 
19312 4 great technical support - Walder 
19313 3 really good for my needs 
19314 3 So far so good. They did well over a 5 hour shoot with about 700 photos. If these hold up over time, they will be a much cheaper alternative to the Nikon. 
19315 4 Great alternate to the expensive gopro cameras. Great features and image resolution for a great price 
19316 4 Fit my camera perfectly and now I have backup lens caps. 
19317 4 Haven t used it yet in the water, but it works great as a handle and for storage. My son stores the charger cable inside. 
19318 4 great tech service 
19319 4 Excellent for what I want. 
19320 4 hope I don t have to use it. 
19321 3 The camera worked well, however the film I received did not work well. Overall the camera itself was a good purchase, and a blast from the past. 
19322 2 Not sure how pleased I am. The first 8 batteries only lasted 2 months in my trail cam. 
19323 4 Works perfectly for my needs ! Couldn t ask for more for the price ... 
19324 1 Broke The second day i bought, i was on a concert.. 
19325 3 fit very tight 
19326 3 Bought this specifically for a snorkling trip during our last vacation. Good performance and easy to carry. Wish I had spent more time learning the menus because glare from the sun made it tough to make changes on the fly. 
19327 4 My favorite favorite selfie stick- so easy to connect, holds the charge long, highly recommended!! 
19328 4 Delivered on time. Great deal! 
19329 4 This battery works just as well as the original battery. The seller gives instruction and guarantees the product. 
19330 4 I enjoyed gazing into the starts at night and I am just so happy that my son finds it fascinating as well and this telescope has been helping him view the stars above in the sky at night 
19331 1 I just really dislike this tripod. Flimsy when fully extended and doesn t feel like it supports the camera well. 
19332 0 Would NOT work on my Leica M. 
19333 3 Direct replacement for my broken lens cap. One of the two plastic springs on the original cap broke and it will be interesting to see if this one is any sturdier. 
19334 4 I called customer support because i was having issues viewing the cam outside of the wifi it was setup on. Henry was very helpful. He got our foscam working in no time. Thank you! I will recommend your services to friends and family. 
19335 2 really weak 
19336 4 Great product 
19337 4 Work great, and have been using them since I bought them. 
19338 3 Just scared people away 
19339 0 It only came in one piece not as advertised! It only has a small piece that doesn t cover my entire lcd for the mark iii such a piece of crap 
19340 2 very big , much larger than other cameras ,, but nice nite view 
19341 2 Good one, but hard to wear and use... I will bet u will not use it often.... 
19342 4 Great product. Very nice camera 
19343 1 Only works up to maybe 5 feet away... nought this to take my family pictures and didn t work for me. 
19344 4 Bought this for big family trip to New York and absolutely LOVE it! Got some great pictures with it and transferring them to my phone has been soooo easy! 
19345 0 It s awful 
19346 3 Works pretty good with my 70D canon. No problems. Kick ass price, too. Canon should lower their prices. 
19347 0 no memory card including 
19348 4 Sharp, crisp photos and videos. 
19349 1 These directions are terrible and I dont like that u have to have a computer to review the images. 
19350 4 I have now had time to use this device and it performs as expected. 
19351 1 bag looks flimsy and does not hold the camera in place 
19352 0 Used this product for a couple of weeks in order to give a proper personal review... WOW! What a piece! Won t focus, can t single to one image, zoom is complete junk, coma is HORRIBLE! Can t even see saturns rings! Go with Baska 
19353 4 Great camera!! The case is nice also! 
19354 4 Must have if you re shooting with a 4BLK. Been through many charges for a few months now and still working great! 
19355 4 I like that this chest mount is so adjustable. I put it on my grandkids over their life jackets while they were wakeboarding (age 10 & 14) and then put it on my husband while he waterskied. My husband has very broad shoulders and chest. Got some fun footage! 
19356 1 This one fits what it says it does just by luck. Very hard to figure out according to info given. 
19357 2 Takes pictures well, and the zoom is great. Dies in 3 minutes if you take a video. 
19358 2 I don t know if it s the paper of the printer, but every picture has a blue tint. The paper fits as advertised but prints odd colors. 
19359 3 Works as advertised, Nikon D-3100. 
19360 4 Go-to lens for portrait and inside work... 
19361 4 I used to have this camera in the year 2007 boy do I miss it! It was so reliable I am glad to see it again! Purchase button CLICK!!! :) 
19362 4 Exactly what I needed to add a Rode Mic to a canon g20. Works great! 
19363 0 Sorry, it did not work after about an hour. Had to return. 
19364 4 Completely transparent. Works perfectly. 
19365 4 Now really I trust.... 
19366 2 Don t spend the money on Sony batteries this brand works just as well at half the cost. 
19367 4 Did a lot of research and glad I ended up with this one. Small but well built and takes great photos. 
19368 4 very light and easy to use 
19369 4 Everything fit and worked great. Nice having the extra battery for backup! 
19370 4 I only have one thing to say...BUY IT...I recommend this to everyone, It s incredible....The last pic is a pic of my Mom s house in a dew drop on a pine needle... 
19371 4 I use these for my wedding film shoots and put LED lights on top to add great lighting. Sturdy stands with great quality to them! 
19372 4 Very pleased with product. Shipping was quick and packing prevented any damage. Will consider when purchasing again. 
19373 4 Guy that I bought this for loves everything about this camera. Was shipped super fast.. 
19374 3 Love the images these attatchments take. Dislike that I have to remove my phone case in order for the lenses to set flat. I use an otter box, I will purchase another case with a smaller lens opening so that the attachable lenses set flat. 
19375 2 the caps don t stay on well, come off easily when bumped. the lens hood was alright, kind of a pain to line up nice though to shade. 
19376 4 These eyepieces are probably One of the best values available.Every amateur should Consider this set. 
19377 4 Ok 
19378 4 Amazing number of accessories and surprisingly nice quality. Will have to take advantage of the online tutorials to be able to handle all the functions of this gem. The bag to hold everything--doesn t. It needs to be about half the size larger. 
19379 4 great construction. Sturdy and well made 
19380 4 amazing product!!! fast shipping!!! just what i needed 
19381 4 Good cap for the Leica televid spotter... 
19382 4 Works great, what a bargain! 
19383 2 its great..alot of attachments..downside not sure what is for what 
19384 4 OUTSTANDING 
19385 4 Exactly what I needed! It s also portable so I can charge my battery anywhere! Amazing! 
19386 4 Had it about a week now and loving it! Easy setup! Great for watching away from home! Love remote tilt and pan!..and especially the notifications when alerts turned on!! Thinking of adding another! 
19387 3 The camera came on time but it was not a white one, it was black and silver. 
19388 4 Best investment EVER 
19389 4 Awesome 
19390 4 A must have they recharge fast 
19391 4 Beautiful case! Fits the camera like a glove. Great for protecting it and carrying it. A great buy! 
19392 4 I purchased this item at a reduced price for my unbiased opinion. I think this is an excellent security camera and well worth what I paid for it. I am considering getting a couple more to complete a remote security setup I have in mind. Easy to setup and use. 
19393 4 cute stuff, everything works. 
19394 4 working as advertised. like it 
19395 4 Perfect substitute at lower $. 
19396 4 What a major upgrade this is for the 50 f1.8 lens. Smaller, lighter & well built. A great choice for the money. 
19397 2 This is my first telescope. I ll probably need to take a class on how to use it. So far, do to my inexperience, I ve been disappointed in difficulty of use 
19398 4 super nice... la recomiendo. 
19399 4 Solidly made, works very well but you need high rings for your rifle and patients to tweak it to preform. Once done its a beaut! G :O) 
19400 4 Batteries hold full charge......great buy! 
19401 4 Worked as expected and came on time.... 
19402 3 I wish to know if this lens is compatible with Blackmagic Design Production cinema Camera 4K (EF Mount) before I place my order. Thanks 
19403 4 Great item 
19404 1 Wasn t as expected 
19405 4 Great lightstand!!!!! What I like most about it is, you can get it low to the ground. Great for setting behind a model and shining a light on the background. Works great for photographing dogs with it low to the ground. Sturdy, well made. 
19406 4 well designed and high optical quality 
19407 1 This tape leaves a sticky residue if left for a long time 
19408 4 I am glad I found these I have 100 uses! Great! 
19409 4 I have been using both of these batteries and this charger for quite a while now, they work perfectly, and actually last a lot longer than the battery that came in the camera! Would purchase again! 
19410 4 Worked perfect !!! Helped me get an expensive camera working again! 
19411 4 I love it It has room for various lenses and sizes. Perfect to take to hikes and get landscaping portraits. Very happy with this purchase!!! 
19412 4 This strap is great for many uses other than preventing serious metal detecting fatigue. It s strong velcro holds up to the toughest of jobs. I use it to hold my hammock together while backpacking. So far I have not fallen. 
19413 4 Arrived on time, and was just what we expected! Great job. 
19414 4 This was a great deal for your Cannon camera. 
19415 3 Simple installation, good quality, setup was okay. 
19416 3 Excellent birthday gift. 
19417 3 GREAT Clarity. Put it on my Sony NEXVG,, the zoom Not 2 smooth, But The Picture VERY Nice. 
19418 2 It is good value for money, but I bought if specifically to protect my Nikon Coolpix camera and expected it to be more of a tight fit. It did not meet my needs. 
19419 4 Works great , good price, stays where put , for mountain biking would be nice to have a shock absorbent mount. In rougher terrain the playback has a little rattle like sound. But so does all the camera s I have tried.. 
19420 3 As advertised. 
19421 4 It is a easy to use product. The price is low and worked better than my friends. 
19422 4 Great product! Took it on vacation and had a lot of fun with it. Easy to use. It fits my Note 3 if I remove the Otter Box. 
19423 0 Does not work. I will be sending it back. We tried it on several different phones. It came in a new box and appeared to be new, but did not work. 
19424 4 heck ya 
19425 4 nice 
19426 4 Works as expected and gpod deal for price. 
19427 1 sucks 
19428 4 Super Comfortable bag, fits my Canon 70D with my 18-55mm lense attached. I dont think it will hold a lense any longer than that with it attached. Fits all my GoPro accessories. 
19429 4 Came on time and nicely packaged. The quality is way better than I expected for such a small camera. Design and finish is very good. Exceeded my expectations. 
19430 4 Solid little stick. Unfortunately, I took it camping and lost the nut before I could even use it. I will glue another one in from my spares... 
19431 4 Awesome kit! It made my trip to Africa easy n efficient. I was always ready for the next shot. 
19432 4 Great strap! Easy to attach to my camera and its so comfy especially if you are using ur camera for a long period of time! Its good quality and I m very happy with this purchase! 
19433 4 Amazing results. Now, the sky comes out blue with white clouds... Most so called Pro photographers do not use this product and the sky looks white on thier pictures. Our sky is not white... Nice product. 
19434 4 Light and very stable for medium size weight. 
19435 4 Robust and durable. 
19436 4 Good product, thank you 
19437 3 This item was just what I needed to mount my GoPro to my road bike and take it on a 100 mile ride. The price was right and it performed as expected. 
19438 4 I was SO happy to get this. Can t wait to use it! 
19439 4 Fantastic !! 
19440 3 Works great but is really expensive. 
19441 4 It read i very good review about this camera and the shipment was excellent and new as described 
19442 3 For the money its a great deal 
19443 4 Excellent lens, one of my favorites I use when I am not using my 35mm. 
19444 3 These are pretty good, I like them. I ve used them for several years now. 
19445 3 functional bag, if a bit heavy. i will be using this as my DSLR bag/purse during my upcoming Italy trip. 
19446 4 Beatiful lens - clarity is amazing. Has become one of my favorites. 
19447 4 Amazing lens, built like a tank, I really love the build quality and the results. 
19448 0 very Poor Quality 
19449 4 Just what I needed 
19450 3 Great cover 
19451 4 Returned this because there was a bunch of wires and I expected less but returning process was quick smooth and easy thanks 
19452 4 Very nice camera takes great picts. 
19453 0 Don t buy, if you have a Galaxy S6 Edge. Wide angle somewhat of an improvement but with a huge drop-off in quality. Discarded. 
19454 4 I gave this polaroid camera to my girlfriend for our anniversary. Pink s her favorite color so I figured she ll love it. And she did! Now e have tons of photos posted on our bedroom wall. 
19455 4 Love it. Works great!! 
19456 4 Great deal for the price works like a charm! 
19457 2 It s a little small for all of the attachments we have for the Go Pro, but is good protection. 
19458 4 A great toy. I can tell you what not to do. 
19459 4 good product so long as one can fly the unit well 
19460 2 Not nearly as good as the Lumix battery but its ok as a back up. Dies really fast. 
19461 4 Extremely easy to use and comes well packaged as pictured 
19462 3 good for the price. Have been using it for a month now in my climbing trips and holds up well. Keep all my connectors, 4 batteries and extra backs and works great. Can toss in my climbing pack without being worried about crushing everything. 
19463 4 once I figured out how to get it on I love it. 
19464 4 Great case. Not too big, not too small 
19465 4 Work great for what I do - YouTube interviews with a DSLR. 
19466 4 Pretty dope!!! I like the fact that it has the plug on the device itself without the dumb cord a+ for that 
19467 0 100% dissatisfied, under the Product Details it says &#34;5.7x5.5x3.2 inches&#34;. Imagine my surprise when I opened the box and fond a 1x1 inch screen 
19468 4 too small but other then that great one 
19469 3 Batteries work fine, and was a quick ship, no complaints 
19470 4 Perfect solution 
19471 4 works as expected and reasonably priced 
19472 4 Small, but large enough that I can find it. Even the dark. 
19473 4 The lens arrived on time and in excellent condition. It is a great portrait lens. I am very pleased with the clarity of the photos produced with the Sony SEL18/B 50mm lens. 
19474 3 fits my aw120 just fine. 
19475 4 Great trail camera. Very sensitive capturing much more than expected. 
19476 4 Great amateur starter telescope, simple enough set up and good enough optics to view the craters on the moon! 
19477 4 Excellent by all means. 
19478 4 OMG!!!!! Thank you very much! We were worried that something would be wrong for that price, but everything came! The shipping was fast and everything inside was perfect. My DOUTHER so happy. It was her birthday present. Thank you very much!!!!!! 
19479 3 Works on my X100T. Documentation leaves a lot to be desired, but I managed to figure stuff out. 
19480 4 excellent lens for the money; the accessory kit was a nice bonus. 
19481 4 Fit much better on my lens than previous purchase 
19482 4 Exactly what I was looking for at a great price. 
19483 2 No good. 
19484 4 Works great - used it underwater and on hikes. Very comfortable, you ll forget you re wearing it. 
19485 4 Great value. We keep it in the car so we can always refresh our batteries while we are away. 
19486 4 ok 
19487 4 GREAT PRODUCT!!!!! 
19488 1 kept dropping off the network - pan feature did not work well 
19489 4 i love it! i thought i would have a hard time getting the thing attached to my camera, but it was easy. does a wonderful job, pleased with my purchase! 
19490 4 Photography is a big hobby for me and this camera does a really does a amazing job. I completely love it and would buy again in a heart beat 
19491 4 All I can say is this is a great deal! Charger & batteries all work great! 
19492 4 WIFE LOVES THIS ITEM 
19493 4 This pole was exactly what I expected and fits perfectly with my GoPro. 
19494 4 Excelent 
19495 4 This turned out to be an excellent, turn-key front light solution for my Parrot AR Drone, so I can fly it, see it better at a distance, and use the camera in low light situations. The light accepts all the factory connectors, and is super light weight. 
19496 0 The protector does not fit the rear screen on of my Nikon D750 well. Would not recommend to other D750 owners. 
19497 4 Works well. No issues. 
19498 4 Good kit and has been working well. 
19499 2 Was too difficult to attach to my Canon T3i. Celltime said they would have someone call me, but never did. Lens produced blurry pictures. Needless to say, this lens was returned at my expense AND a restocking fee, which I feel is unfair. 
19500 4 Works great thanks 
19501 4 I ve gotten some very nice shots with this lens. 
19502 4 Nice product for tripod work. Allows easy access to the microphone port and comes with a decent lens protector. I am very pleased with this product and have used it for approximately ten hours already with my GoPro Hero 4 Silver. 
19503 4 Functions as advertised 
19504 1 Nicely made item, but the cutouts do not fit my Hero 3+ and accessories. 
19505 4 Absolutely love this lens. I m an amateur photographer but this lens really makes taking a quality image so easy. I have had it for over a month and it is sturdy so far. 
19506 3 Works as advertised. The only thing that could be better is a more precise charge indicator. I will leave my OEM charger at home on my next vacation. 
19507 4 Great stick, used in salt-water with zero issues. The anodized blue parts look great and it feels top quality. 
19508 4 Works like original... 
19509 4 Love it! 
19510 4 Good 
19511 4 I use this on top of a monopod - works great, quick to set different angles. 
19512 4 Has been really useful in our camera kit, thanks 
19513 4 And GoPro sells their piece of plastic for HOW MUCH?!? This part is cheap and fantastically well made! Don t know why they went with hex-screws though... But you can replace them if you want. I replaced the one main one with a smatree metal screw on mine. 
19514 4 Works just like it should. 
19515 0 I got a defective item. I have tried to change a new battery. but i have never used it still now. so i want to return it. 
19516 4 works great 
19517 4 I m very happy with the purchase. All items work perfectly for my Nikon D5200 camera. I think the assortment of the products was a very clever one. I recommend this product. Many thanks. 
19518 4 Works as advertised. Very satisfied with this product. 
19519 3 very good product! Love it! 
19520 4 Yes, exactly what it says it does. Works fine and I have extra rings for all kind of needs. 
19521 0 Sucked. I have a rebel t3i which it says it is compatible with. ... it s not 
19522 3 Work as expected. 
19523 4 Easy set up and works great. Have also used foscam which is a huge pain to setup compared to dlink. 
19524 4 Doberman Security met my highest expectations, was easy and quick to install, and provides an extremely alarming signal to deter any possible break-in. 
19525 4 Looks like genuine parts. Thank you China! 
19526 4 Perfect camera. Have seen caregivers not taking care of my husband! So, it was perfect. I could check on him through cell phone when I was gone. I CAN TALK TO THEM, ALSO. 
19527 3 good 
19528 4 It is exactly as described. I would deal with this supplier again 
19529 4 Excellent! 
19530 4 Grip is very sturdy, and made if very nice material, it doesn t seem cheap at all. very happy with this purchase, would definitely buy again. 
19531 3 Fits perfectly 
19532 3 Charged the battery very fast but I haven t used the battery yet to see how it preforms. 
19533 1 Camera has difficulty focusing on small items, zoom is so-so. If I had to do it all over again I would shell out the extra money for a better point and shoot. 
19534 4 Works great only issue is getting connected to view it from my phone if i am not on the same network at my house. 
19535 4 Great camera, great for beginners but looks like you can go next level if you want to learn how to use all the bells and whistles. I managed to get it on sale for 300 which is a steal. 
19536 2 for the price its ok not stainless steal it rust within a day other than that it floats and holds go pro 4 very well in water i like that it has the screw hole on bottom thats why i went with this one 
19537 2 I just order for one.. then now after i reviced.. i found it double.. can i return? 
19538 4 I really do love this dual mount. Extremely affordable an great quality. 
19539 4 Great product. 
19540 4 Better than the one that came with the camera.I am very happy 
19541 3 For paying that price, It is good... 
19542 3 I loves me the X-T10, but it is small and not so easy to hold if you have large hands. This handgrip, while outrageously expensive, helps give a better grip. I wouldn t be without it. One star off for the price. 
19543 4 Excellent lens 
19544 4 Housing arrived exactly as described. Shipped and received promptly. Well made and good quality. No problems to 27m depth. See photos from Daymaniyat Islands in Oman attached. 
19545 4 I like that the hot shoe mount is on the handle to the side and not directly on top of gopro. I also like the foam grip. 
19546 4 This was purchased for my daughter for her DC trip. Takes great pics and very easy to use. After seeing the photos she took I want one for myself! 
19547 4 Good quality and good fit. Very satisfied 
19548 0 One of the batteries was defective or was not compatible with my Sony A77ii. The charger would not charge & stopped working a few days after initial use, & left me in a lurch work-wise. Would not recommend. 
19549 2 Does not fit Panasonic Lumix LX100 as some have claimed. Looks like a solid case otherwise. 
19550 3 Great option if your camera doesn t have a pre made version available. Nikon d5300 
19551 4 Great lens and probably the least I ll ever spend on a lens by far. Image quality is really nice can t believe this lens was so affordable. 
19552 4 Awesome accessory for my Olympus TG-4 
19553 3 Good 
19554 0 Flew for 5 minutes. No longer will lift of the ground. Don t waste your money. 
19555 4 I love it a great purchase would bye it again

19564 4 grandson loves how clear the underwater vedio s are 
19565 4 Fit perfectly on my D200. 
19566 0 It had a bad camera and it would barley fly outside and the controls were very difficult to control. 
19567 3 I like it. I just understood it had wifi. 
19568 4 Super solid tripod. Great deal for your money. It s a steal, really. Highly recommend to people looking for a high quality tripod in the sub-$150 range.

19576 2 They work, a bit more flimsy than one would prefer, but THEY WORK! 
19577 4 Nice wifi cams. I set them to record to my 3T external drive. Easy setup and a decent picture for the price. 
19578 4 good quality works great 
19579 2 It easily slips off but it s overall standard 
19580 4 Its a must have for the gopro! Easy to install and stays on through case removal after case removal. Must have!

19589 4 works great! 
19590 4 Works great a+++ 
19591 4 Fit right on the camera, good quality 
19592 1 The alarm is fine if that is all you want, but the &#34;chime&#34; setting is loud and harsh and blares in your customers ear as they walk through the door. 
19593 4 perfect to my d3200, good hand Grip and more power to shoot. 
19594 4 great. 
19595 3 nice to be able to charge 2 batteries at the same time. You have to wiggle the batteries a little sometimes to get them plugged in correctly 
19596 4 Exactly what I needed; arrived in great time for upcoming cruise. A handy device 
19597 4 Delivered what was described, quickly. 
19598 4 Works perfectly.

19606 4 I m very satisfied

19613 4 Love this! It works exactly as described and very easy to install and can be moved around the house as needed. 
19614 3 it worked cliffdiving from 40ft! with the string was longer though 
19615 3 good, but on the smaller side 
19616 3 I got what I expected, I can t complain? 
19617 1 The axis are too loose..never expect to be disappointed for this... 
19618 4 As expected! 
19619 2 Product just as advertised. Great merchant 
19620 4 good 
19621 0 Piece of junk. Simply does not work and instructions were for a completely different device. STAY AWAY FROM THIS ITEM. I filed a claim with Amazon and we will see what happens. I am not going to return to China. 
19622 4 Nice bag! 
19623 4 Velvia never disappoints. 
19624 4 great 
19625 4 Awesome product 
19626 1 cheap. but do the job. 
19627 4 The product is great and we have not had any problems with it. It was delivered ahead of scheduling and the packaging was well done. 
19628 4 It s Wasabi Power. Charger, batteries work great. Much less than the Panasonic batteries in cost. 
19629 1 With a go pro it s hard to balance this thing getting it to balance without moving is easy but keeping it balance while moving seems impossible but maybe it s just me lol 
19630 4 Great value and great quality lenses. I m shocked at how good it is. 
19631 4 Good replacement 
19632 4 Mounted it on the ceiling, it works well, nice pix. 
19633 4 Absolute must have to protect expensive lenses from impact damage.... 
19634 2 The card makes it worth while, but probably won t use most of the items. 
19635 3 So far so good. An improvement over previous models. Touch screen. Easier navigation through menu opens. Easier download to memory card and thus to editing. 
19636 3 One battery lasts my just under a year in my range finder, playing three times a week. 
19637 4 Worked great 
19638 4 love it. 
19639 2 Considerably over priced, I believe. 
19640 3 They seem to have worked great while being used on my first dives and first time use of the GoPro! 
19641 2 Stands are very weak and wobbly. Lenses are mediocre. 
19642 4 Nice camera! 
19643 4 Shipping was a little bit late, 4 days but that was on USPS not on the seller. Great lens great quality and not full price :) cant be happier. 
19644 0 The LCD screen did not work 
19645 4 Item was fairly priced-described just as I got it-shipped quickly-great purchase 
19646 4 as advertised. 
19647 4 I love this camera...easy to use and SHARP pictures. The quick video button is a newer feature and GREAT! This is my 4th cannon camera and I would not consider buying any other brand. Focus Camera bundles are great money savers. 
19648 3 I m always trying to find the right mount, screw, whatever for all the mounts for my GoPro. This gives me a little more to work with. Felt it was priced a little high for what I got, though. 
19649 0 bad panel. Hooked it up and just made clicks. don t buy 
19650 4 Fits my Canon 430 flash well; snaps right on and does not fall off. Great item at a good price. 
19651 4 Easy to install, great picture day or night. 
19652 4 This is an amazing lens. I took it out for a test drive and it blew my mind in reach, clarity and contrast. 
19653 4 The harness looks very well made. I am looking forward to giving the Geekpro and chest harness to my Grandson for his 14 th Birthday Nov 2nd. I will be happy to review it at that time. 
19654 4 Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for! 
19655 4 Great product. Fast shipping. Thank You. 
19656 4 Great product. 
19657 0 Waste of money. Terrible distortion. 
19658 3 Fantastic light or the price. Pretty well built stand too. I appreciate the fact that it has 5 switches so that I can get exactly the amount of light I want. I did drop one start though because one of the 5 bulbs was defective and did not work. 
19659 4 DJI battery what can I say, it works well. 
19660 4 perfect carrying case for the fujifilm instaxmini8 
19661 4 These have every look and feel of OEM GoPro mount clips. 
19662 3 The hprc case is amazing. Just what I expected. Heavy duty baby. The only reason I didn t give it 5 stars is the foam layout was different than the picture. I wasn t sure if I received the correct case or not. 
19663 1 Not a great camera. My fault should have read more on it. Too slow to take a second shot. 5 second delay. Quality not as good with final photo. 
19664 2 These batteries are okay. They drain too fast for me and don t put out as power as I think they should. 
19665 4 Greatest glasses cleaner out there 
19666 4 Perfect, and so much better than paying at a retail store. 
19667 3 Just received mine yesterday. It s very comfortable and light, which makes my Nikon seem lighter when I have it over my shoulders. I also like the color designs on this strap plus it s not expensive. I d recommend others buying this brand of camera neck strap. 
19668 4 Bought this to store/carry all parts for Sylvania 9-inch portable DVD players (2 screens). Both players fit along with all the cords, chargers, etc. and 2 DVDs. Perfect. 
19669 4 Works great! Plug it into my laptop and upload my photos quick. 
19670 3 It functions as advertised - price is right. 
19671 4 great product thank you 
19672 0 broke on 1st use 
19673 0 Bought 2 neither one works. Waste of money. 
19674 4 works well sofar 
19675 0 Poor product. The lens is so lousy it cuts your pictures. The camera is so poorly engineered that the film gets stuck. The film is so small. The old polaroid was perfect why did they have to change it ? 
19676 0 No good resolution 
19677 4 Works very well on my Nikon. Very comfortable. 
19678 4 Sensors work as expected and you get 5 of them at a nice price. 
19679 1 It was pretty great, until it broke after about a month of use. The attaching screw on the bottom snapped in half, so now I can t attach a monopod or anything of the sort to it, therefore rendering it pretty useless. I got what I paid for, I guess. 
19680 4 Love it...perfect for selfies. 
19681 4 works very good on my helmet and very pleased. Thanks!! 
19682 4 Great price for this one! It s a steal! 
19683 4 I really can t find a fault with this light. It is bright and the quality of light is good. It has barn doors, a remote and other accessories. This is a very good product. 
19684 3 Works as described, arrived on time and with no problems. I use it in my daily log and it s great. 
19685 3 Scope works great. The program is a bit skepitcal. 
19686 2 You get what you pay for. Replaced it after a year. 
19687 3 Nice! 
19688 4 great product. 
19689 4 Works perfect for my camera!! 
19690 4 worked great 
19691 0 Can t figure out how to use the stupid thing. Instructions are as poor as they come!! Wouldn t recommend it to anyone. 
19692 4 I Traded in my Canon 7D, which I never really enjoyed (it has since been discontinued), after purhasing this camera! I love this camera - the pictures look amazing! 
19693 4 It works well. It helps me stabilize the camera when I shoot. 
19694 0 Just purchased this and found it only fires at full power on manual and TTL is stuck on one power as well. Tested it on several attempts. Hoping this is just a fluke. 
19695 4 Very durable and sturdy strap 
19696 3 very reliable 
19697 3 Has come in pretty handy 
19698 4 Not made cheap this is a steardy tool I use it on gun range in windy days does more then I expected it be for $ thanks for the deal 
19699 4 Works perfectly. Definitely adds bulk, but worth it to only need to charge my daily-use camera once a month. 
19700 4 Works well. Just a tad off in color though. 
19701 4 Great Deal, Fine product, Five Stars***** 
19702 4 Amazing~! I love it. Holds really well on most surfaces--glass, body panels on a car, most flat surfaces. Grip is extra tight. Get this! End of the story. 
19703 0 did not work for the model it says it does 
19704 1 The aluminum material was too lightweight and the head was not fluid enough for my needs so I returned it. 
19705 4 It works perfectly for me. It gives that extra light that I need and having the shoebox gives it a softer and warmer affect. Very pleased. 
19706 4 Works extremely well and can be used with either eye by turning the eyecup. 
19707 4 Great inexpensive tripod bag does the job, was a bit small but I can not blame the bag for my tripod for being a few inches to big Good price good quality travels nicely 
19708 4 Good for mounting outside 
19709 3 Fits well into the camera. Would have liked a car solution as well, but that was not promised. 
19710 4 This is inexpensive and does a good job. 
19711 4 solid app. worth the price. Caught my dog turning on my gas oven.. No joke 
19712 4 Works great! 
19713 4 beautiful and good quality 
19714 4 This is a great accessory for hiking, or really any hands free activity. The hat clip is genius, I like to clip mine to a bandana. 
19715 4 Comfortable and stylish 
19716 4 Bought this for my new lens and it is awesome. Easy to fit. A great purchase! 
19717 4 survived my purpose and the price was right 
19718 4 Nikon is the best! 
19719 3 It could be a little bit louder and a little more vicious sounding but I think it works fine 
19720 4 This accessory kit is amazing! You have so many options of ways to film from your GoPro! 
19721 4 Very light weight and easy to use. Takes great photos. Purchased for my wife and she prefers it to her Iphone. 
19722 4 A good product. Fast battery charging. Displays information accurately. Battery is compatible with fujifilm xp80. 
19723 4 I am satisfied with device and the product support. AR004218 was very supportive at DLink. 
19724 4 using it with the sony rx1r. Does the job even though a bit overpriced. 
19725 2 Having problems with some of the futures to my camera when the battery pack is connected. As for the power supply it works great. 
19726 3 Great handle for a gopro 
19727 4 great 
19728 0 Was not a Honeywell part, rather a generic off-brand replacement. Does work, but not what I thought I was buying. 
19729 4 Awesome 
19730 3 Pretty good protection and pricing, however it s a bit hard to take my Xiaomi Yi Camera out of it. The camera kind of gets stuck inside. I still use it daily though since I have bunch of goPro accessories to use between this and my Hero4 Silver. 
19731 4 Thank you, arrived as stated. 
19732 4 Nice color, nice design, durable fabric 
19733 4 Remote shutter release. Works as promised. There are cheaper alternatives out there, but I had two cheaper ones that stopped working after a while. 
19734 0 Could not get a clear picture Returned 
19735 4 Perfect! 
19736 4 This seller is fantastic! They have excellent customer service and their prices and products are great! I am a very satisfied repeat customer! 
19737 3 Great for most situations, It would have been perfect if it had a 180 degree rotation so that it can be bounced of side walls. 
19738 3 Arrived quickly and works as it should. Instruction aren t very good but YouTube can help you with that. 
19739 4 Great product and works really well. I use it as my outdoor cam without any issues. 
19740 4 Perfect! 
19741 3 Inexpensive and good quality. Will likely upgrade to higher wattage bulbs, though stands and umbrellas are great. Good customer service as well...they send-out replacement for broken bulb immediately. 
19742 4 Great little action camera. Well worth the price. 
19743 4 good quality everyday backpack. comfort, style, alot of pockets. 
19744 4 Camera case was great recommend this if you have move video Camera 
19745 4 Perfect an fast delivery 
19746 3 Great lens on a 5DsR. 
19747 4 Perfect 
19748 4 Ignore the negative reviews! I got this to see what my puppy is doing in the when given new freedom. Setting up the internet connection is not easy but following the directions closely will work. Very awesome! 
19749 4 Good communication and quick shipping. Excellent product-much better than expected. Does not leave filmy streaks like the others I ve tried, they disappear immediately and you don t need to go over your screen again. Can be reused several times. Great on cell phone screens, Ipad, Ipod, etc..Highly recommend 
19750 4 Item arrived as described. Quick ship. Highly recommend! 
19751 0 Don t use it 
19752 4 Great camera. My daughter loves it! 
19753 4 Made of metal so it s more resilient and can hold up to a lot of use. Threads seem to line up nicely and go on without a fight. 
19754 2 Great value brought for a present the individual didn t want it. 
19755 3 Took it to Europe buy plane and train, came back and it s like new. 
19756 4 Danny at Foscam helped me with the port forwarding so I could view the cameras on my mobile device while away from home. He was fast, easy tho understand and professional. 
19757 4 This is a standard UV filter. It appears to be performing just fine, OK combination of price and performance. 
19758 2 Eh worth about what it costs 
19759 4 This was a gift to complement my daughter s 10th bday gift. It was a perfect fit and she loves all the extras. She has not yet tried the selfie adaptation but the rest I would recommend. The delivery was extra fast which was a great plus in my book. 
19760 4 Works great! Simple to use, paired easily with my S5. Much better selfie, and will use this a lot for event pics. Compact size fits in purse. 
19761 3 The device is pretty good, does it s job, nothing special about it, the clicking sound is a bit annoying but otherwise it s ok to know if it s still moving or not. https://youtu.be/yoQnYusGtPo 
19762 4 Great case. Fits camera like a glove. Leather and stitching excellent. Even ithough it was shipped form China, I got it in less than 2 weeks 
19763 0 bad 
19764 4 So many tripods to choose from, why not just get one from Amazon? I couldn t be happier! Tripod has very sturdy build, can be set to any height you desire, and any of the adjustments will stay tight wherever you put them. 
19765 4 Fits well. As advertised. 
19766 2 Hard to get camera in and out of case 
19767 3 Super easy to install and great picture. 
19768 4 small - compact - safe - wellmade 
19769 4 got this as a gift 
19770 4 perfect for what I wanted...holds plenty but isn t too bulky....very comfortable 
19771 4 this item is designed very well and installed pretty easy 
19772 0 They send me a completely wrong battery in a A640PX box. Don t buy this if you re looking for this battery! Very dissapointed. 
19773 4 It was nice to have these extra battery packs for my honeymoon! Worked wonderfully and would recommend to anyone! 
19774 4 love it 
19775 4 This is one of the best monitor we have worked with so far. Super easy useful interface, very well thought design, light weight, luts via SD card insert. It is worth every penny. Big respect for SmallHD to put such a product. 
19776 3 not bad 
19777 4 All the items in the picture arrived. I didn t test all yet, but at least looks good and work. 
19778 4 Been waiting for this truly wireless video security solution for a long time. It works exactly as I d hoped. I recommend this system to everyone that will listen. Go ahead and pass Go. 
19779 0 not a dvr 
19780 3 I haven t used it that much yet. Still learning. But so far everything Seems to be working just fine. 
19781 4 Beyond happy with the purchase might be expensive but well worth every penny, I had a phantom fc40 before but this well surpasses every phantom so far in every way, well imo it does the inspire was to expensive 
19782 2 typical 
19783 4 Perfect, works as intended 
19784 4 Really like having lens clip holder on my camera strap. I don t always take my camera bag or have pockets to put lens cap in. This solves that problem! 
19785 4 Love it. 
19786 3 Got this for my wife who s an amateur photographer. The kit comes with everything you need for a quick and easy lighting boost. From making home videos to shooting scenes outdoors, it works great. The price was excellent and gives you a lot for the money. 
19787 1 Took small tumble to the side and these cracked without even protecting the props. Chipped a prop and completely broke off a guard. Cheap pieces of s***. Very light though 
19788 4 Works perfectly as described. Anyone with a DSLR should have one of these (really though, they should just come with the camera...) 
19789 4 As addvertized 
19790 2 excellent item, solved my problem 
19791 4 Wonderful camera! Got it for my 10-year-old daughter for her birthday and it s her favorite gift! Love it! 
19792 4 Holds camera, USB cord and batteries fine. Less expensive than similar cases offered by camera manufacturers. 
19793 1 Does t put out much Ir light. the video camera has some IR led s and I see no improvment when I add this for extra light. 
19794 4 Great deal and excellent product for our purpose. 
19795 1 Perfect fit for my DSLR but the sting broke within a couple months of use :( 
19796 3 Fast shipping looks good works awesome battery doesn t last long do wich sucks connects to any smartphone doesn t have a motorcycle helmet attachments only for bike helmet wich sucks but other than that it s awesome 
19797 0 never worked peace of crap 
19798 2 it s hard to remote this DVR. 
19799 4 Great lightweight tripod. 
19800 4 Love this to turn any purse into a camera bag. I took it on a trip to Prague and it was perfect! I had a canon rebel t3i and batteries, Chargers, etc with plenty of room. 
19801 0 Just bought this product and two cameras don t work at all Who do I send this back to ??? Amazon or zmodo 
19802 2 doesn t really fit the rx100-3 but is fine on my rx100 
19803 4 Works great with my Sony camera! 
19804 4 Not sure why people say it was stiff? It s probably the softest strap I ve ever felt. The next best strap would be an Artisan and Artist silk strap, but they re way more expensive. 
19805 4 Loud enough ! Works great ! Sensor is super accurate ! 
19806 4 Very nice monopod. The carbon fiber is very strong and this thing can take a load. Very impressed with the fit and finish of this item. Benro makes a Quality piece. 
19807 2 An extra battery is always nice to have on hand and if it is already mounted, even better. The grip works just great, but the remote is another story. I have followed the the directions and can not get it to work. 
19808 4 Great little shoulder rig for the price. Used it yesterday on a shoot and did the job perfectly. 
19809 3 Works great as expected. A goodvalue 
19810 3 A great alternative to using the one by Nikon, cost effective and sturdy, no issues works great. 
19811 4 Item performed great on our recent trip. Item delivered on time. Batteries charged & worked right out of the box. Very convenient on trips. Will order another set. 
19812 4 Love it. 
19813 2 Purchased for the tamron 150x600. VERY tight fit. Not ideal for this lens 
19814 4 Great 
19815 4 love it 
19816 2 when you turn the camera , I realized that in the configuration the WiFi option is not listed, this camera brings wifi? Help me configure the wifi 
19817 4 Works great 
19818 4 Came exactly as described. Works great with my GoPro Hero. 
19819 3 Clarity is good. A little too sensitive at night - even after adjustment. 
19820 2 Works great with my lumix. Would have loved an extra pocket for a extra sd card. 
19821 4 fits very well!! would buy again 
19822 3 Good as it is Nikon s. 
19823 4 I will give them a 6 Star if I could. It does not matter where I am I can see my pet. Great colors. Delivered on time and does everything the sellers says it suppose to do. 
19824 0 Not worth the money. The battery cannot be changed. Picture quality was bad. Returned it. 
19825 4 Wonderful 
19826 4 This is a great case. Fair price, keeps my expensive Nikon 5200 safe and snug. Plenty of pouches for other things, batteries, chargers, SD cards, etc. Highly recommend. Good quality. 
19827 3 Excelent for the price, but don t expect durability. 
19828 4 I installed this button camera on my clothes with a mini DVR, it looks very good, and no one knows this is a camera. Like it. 
19829 4 Just what I needed. Very White cloth. Very portable. 
19830 4 Great product at a great price! 
19831 3 Works well. 
19832 1 It s was just could meet d expectations 
19833 2 The action pack is a better deal. Wish I had waited. 
19834 4 Item does well jobs as described. Thanks. 
19835 4 just what I was looking for. 
19836 4 Good product 
19837 4 Very useful and great. 
19838 0 Half of the pictures would develop and the other half never turned out. Waste of money. 
19839 4 Thank you 
19840 4 As with everything Phantom 3 it s tough, durable and beautifully engineered and constructed. 
19841 4 Exactly as described and just what I needed to round out my Nikon d3200. :) 
19842 4 this backpack fits everything and I take it everywhere. I especially liked it it has straps that can hold my tripod on one side and the stabilizer on the other. There also pockets for all your little accessories including ST cards. It is also made of really really good quality. 
19843 0 This item was a waste of my money. It never worked right out of the box. The instructions were not in English and it went downhill from there. 
19844 4 1 
19845 4 Good quality and good price. Very satisfied. 
19846 0 The description says &#34;Which Has The 18-55mm Lens&#34;... Lens cap (Polaroid) says right on it: 52mm. It does not fit a 55mm lens. Not the first complaint about this...but they still do not change the description. 
19847 4 Perfect for my telescope needs 
19848 3 The camera is that easy, or you can do it all manually. I love my new camera, and I am learning how to take a better quality picture with all the different options. 
19849 4 Perfect for the basics, holds camera extra lens, batteries and filters 
19850 0 Quit working after 2 weeks. 2 did the same thing don t buy. 
19851 4 Works great! 
19852 4 Works well, seems to be pretty steady and sturdy. 
19853 4 Saved me $90 from having to take it in to my local camera shop and clean dust off the sensor. Thanks! 
19854 4 Excellent product just as advertised. Well built solid. Only complaint Is view finder must be at a angle when opening or it hits the top of cage. Arrived 2 weeks early love that. 
19855 4 Great camera at a great price 
19856 3 Seems to be a nice bag just what I was looking for good size and movable dividers inside on Velcro 
19857 3 Good photos and video quality with shown mounts. Good for basic and occasional usage. L 
19858 4 Nice to be able to use my old lens again. 
19859 4 It fits perfectly with my requirements I even use it for my underwater photography. 
19860 3 Was spectacle at first, but they did the job as expected. Glad I brought these diving goggles!!! 
19861 4 Well done, I Like 
19862 3 Seems to be very solid quality

19864 4 Perfect camera for our kids works great easy to use. 
19865 3 Perfect 
19866 4 Items work great. Perfect description. FSt delivery. Great price. Over alll excellent transaction 
19867 4 It works well for my purposes. The app is easy to use. Replacement cameras are not too expensive 
19868 4 Nice camera. I ve made many a picture and memory with this camera. 
19869 4 Love it amazing 
19870 4 good deal! 
19871 2 Love this lens. First copy had front element fall out of it, as it was only secured by glue. Had to buy a second copy, but image quality and usability is great. 
19872 1 Haha good junk camera! 
19873 4 Fits my T5i like a glove 
19874 4 Great illumination from this. Saved from replacing a camera in which the IR died. Can now use at night without issue. 
19875 4 it did what i wanted 
19876 3 really good heavy duty camera... its a pain to adjust you need allen wrenches but other than that its a great camera 
19877 2 Too small for anything! 
19878 4 This is a great bag at the price I was looking for. I like that I can put my laptop in it, but it does make things cozy for my fat camera. I d buy this again. 
19879 4 perfect for capturing about 2 hrs of video 
19880 1 Saw the stand broken upon opening the box. I had wished to place the unit on a table but as a result of the broken stand had to screw it to the wall. 
19881 3 Floats phone in water and with a waterproof case. Fits great on any size wrist, even kids and stays on wrist. 
19882 4 This is a decent mic for the money and I have no complaints 
19883 3 Great product, just wish the cable was a little longer but not a deal breaker. 
19884 0 Didn t come with the 8GB card and had to send back. 
19885 4 Fits my T5i and extra batteries. Great for anyone who films. Also fits in another bag so you don t look sus with a camera everywhere.

19887 4 Awesome product it is great for the price and works really well.

19890 4 As expected. Very satisfied with the product. 
19891 4 Easy to use! 
19892 4 A most have for go pro owner, the go pro battery only last 2 hours max so it good to carry few back ups just in case. i have 4 of these because i go out on long hikes 
19893 4 Works great! 
19894 4 This camera was the perfect replacement for our parking area 
19895 3 It s a great looking strap, it s not that comfortable but what to be expected. It look beautiful with my film camera. 
19896 4 Great camera, easy to use. feels good, great pictures. 
19897 4 Love the camera, easy to use and great pictures 
19898 4 So far have had good signal strength with my fatshark goggles. Definitely needs power filtering, without filtering I was getting all kinds of horizontal white lines. I tossed in a cheap UBEC and then it went perfectly clear. Range tests coming soon! 
19899 3 Met my needs. 
19900 4 These cameras work very well. They were easy to setup and once they were setup I was able to go wireless. Work great with my Android phone. Looks like a good design and seem very durable. Try one or two like I did. 
19901 3 I like it overall, not always the best quality in low light 
19902 4 Very high quality battery for GoPro Hero 4 Black ed. Just like OEM battery from GoPro. Worth every cent. 
19903 4 Great product 
19904 4 I just received my set. I m now going to purchase units for ALL of my lenses. It s a great investment. I have noticed some vignetting when mounted on my 16-35mm f/4. That one might be returned. The 24-70mm 2/8 seems fine. 
19905 4 Did the job just right for what I wanted to do. I clipped it to a Garmin bean bag mount. 
19906 4 Great product. strong/sturdy/nice case/well made 
19907 4 Excellent!!! Great price. Prompt service 
19908 0 will not record for me! 
19909 0 I got mine.. And after one day it refuse to turn on.. I charged the battery but still isn t working.. Planning for a refund! 
19910 4 Fast delivery, product as described. Would do biz, again. LOVE this monopod! 
19911 4 Fit well, easy to install 
19912 3 Generally good, but i m in the bushes and trees a lot. The adhesive that attaches the strap to the lens cap is not good enough for me. 
19913 4 Excellent tri pod. I use it for my spotting scope. Light weight and fits in my backpack. 
19914 4 Okay. 
19915 4 Wish the camera came with this, works like it is part of camera! 
19916 4 This accessory kit fits my canon camera prefect. It is a great accessory to have to protect the len. 
19917 4 Super 
19918 4 Easy to work. Good quality. 
19919 4 great 
19920 4 Great camera, clear pictures with vivid colors. Like the long range zoom 
19921 4 purchased this pristine camera with battery grip, magnifier eyepiece, sigma flash. Well-pleased with everything i have used so far; have not used flash. Shutter count was low 1500. Seller answered all my questions to my satisfaction and i recommend this seller. 
19922 0 Not a very good replacement for the Panasonic branded battery. Short life, very fast rolloff of power at end. Wouldn t recommend, wouldn t purchase again. 
19923 4 Connects very quickly with other Yongnuo and Canon products. 
19924 4 Exactly what i was looking for. I use it a lot. 
19925 4 So light and worked perfectly on my rafting trip! Fit nicely on my helmet! 
19926 4 Everything fine, useful as expected & good delivery service... 
19927 4 The D750 camera is everything Nikon says it is. 
19928 4 Received in a timely manner and as advertised. Haven t utilized all of them yet but they do fit well on the adapter ring for my PowerShot. Thanks. 
19929 4 Another perfect fit for my studio from the good folks at Cowboy Studios. 
19930 4 Does what its supposed to. Easy to install. I recommend using a UV filter along with this to protect the exposed contacts on the back of the lens... the adapter has the treading for the filter so its perfect. 
19931 2 Good strap, but has a tendency to want to twist around & the placed side ended up facing out. 
19932 3 Nice camera for the price! 
19933 2 little poor quality zipper 
19934 4 I carry a Sony DSLR camera and several attachments in it. Not a lot of extra room, but enough. 
19935 2 Concept s OK but battery does not really last long. I used it few times but battery does not last +2 hours albeit I charge it full when I first got it. Not sure if I got a bad unit. 
19936 4 Great stuff for great price though the step up has wifi 
19937 4 Perfect fit, was a replacement for the one I lost. 
19938 4 So when I ordered these, I though they where air cushioned, they are not they are spring, however, they are 100% metal and I have no fear of the clamps letting go on them... They would be 6 stars I hey where also air cushioned 
19939 3 MORE THAN ENOUGH WIRE SERVED ITS PURPOSE GOOD BUY 
19940 4 Very easy set up. Quality of camera s is good during day and night. Able to view from smartphone with ease. I like being able to monitor my home while I am at work. 
19941 4 Very pleased with the camera. The instructions for the WiFi connection are sorely lacking. Fortunately Nikon was able to walk me through the procedure. 
19942 4 Great!!! 
19943 3 The lenses are a little smaller than I was expecting. But other than that they re really nice. Fit well and do not fog up at all. The zebra lenses are great from driving in bright sun to biking through shaded trails. 
19944 2 too big 
19945 4 I wear reading glasses and this help me see what I am taking pictures of without them. 
19946 4 Love this camera bag. Is the pecfect size, compact, not to big. My Canon EOS Rebel T6i with a 18-135mm lens fits perfectly! 
19947 0 Display is barely readable after only a few weeks of operation. Logitech has lost their hold on the WiLife market. 
19948 4 Exactly what we needed 
19949 4 These &#34;bags&#34; provide great protection for my Canon lenses. I keep a small Canon Vixia video camera in the largest bag. 
19950 3 Great Camera, for the price picture resolution a lot better than my cam s that came with my DVR. Im going to replace my other two cameras... 
19951 4 great 
19952 4 So far, so good. Haven t taken it into the water yet...we ll see what the second half of this review looks like... 
19953 4 Awesome for the money. Be sure to use 720p (60FPS) when shooting fast paced footage 
19954 0 waste of money!!! Not happy at all. very bad quality. 
19955 4 The NEST cam is wonderful but......The website to view the recordable is far far less than apealing to use in comparison to the dropcam website. The drop cam website had this ease of use whereas the nest website is slow and has a lot of bugs. Mainly slow...... 
19956 4 Works just fine 
19957 4 amazing 
19958 4 I bought this camera for my recent vacation. I had it in the water with me on several occasions. This camera is excellent for the price. I love the selfie function too. Overall I m very happy with this purchase! 
19959 4 Great deal!!! 
19960 4 is working real good. 
19961 4 Expensive but worth, my daughter love it and have so much fum taking pics with her friends! Received it quickly and well package. 
19962 0 I could not get the camera to charge, so I returned it. 
19963 4 So easy to set up and use. It s very practical. The Nest Cam gives us peace of mind when we re away from home. 
19964 4 as described. Thanks! 
19965 3 simple to use, excellent starter camera set for my friend s 14 year old daughter 
19966 3 Pretty cool toy, Easy to fly and best value! 
19967 2 Just Okay, Rarly use it due to its flimsy nature. Don t be fooled by it s rugged appearance. The part that turns is loose and never is really stable. Good for hanging a small LED light. 
19968 4 I wanted to tell you how pleased i was with the way my order was handled. It arrived earlier thank expected and the product was just as described. The customer service was \\ top notch\\ thank you 
19969 3 Great value pack for the price can t beat it batteries last longer than I thought they were gonna too 
19970 4 I never regret buying this. Great product by a great company which I have known since I was about 4 or 5 years old (in 1995 I guess) 
19971 2 They work, but was hoping they d be a little longer on the handle side. Probably would not buy again. 
19972 4 Works great! Good for placing plants in your house that have certain light requirements. 
19973 4 Great product for the price!! 
19974 4 This screen protector fits my Canon 5D iii with amazing precision and clarity. DEFINITELY an A+ 
19975 3 It works very well but the lens cap is very hard to take on and off. 
19976 4 Great bag, well padded and just the right amount of storage for day to day use. 
19977 4 Awesome product 
19978 4 LOVE the zoom.... really great so far. 
19979 4 Works Just fine. Would recommend 
19980 0 Not as listed and had white screen P O S!!!!!!! 
19981 0 Upon arrival, the rubber part came 75% off from the hard plastic frame that slips over the bracket. This was why I bought a replacement, as my original one had finally pulled apart after three years. The replacement was useless. 
19982 4 I like my tripod a lot. It s everything I needed. 
19983 2 A little cheezy for the price, but interesting to experiment with. 
19984 4 Great price and quality 
19985 3 Recommended, but slightly pricey. 
19986 4 Very good. Worked well. I have the door open at my store and need it something to let me know when someone enter. 
19987 2 Could be a little more sturdy 
19988 3 One of the batteries failed after one month. The camera simply doesn t register that it s there anymore. The other works just as well as my Sony battery. I average about 400-500 shots per battery, but I have airplane mode turned on and auto-focus off (Sony a7ii). 
19989 1 This step up filter adaptor is made aluminum instead of brass, so it has a tendency to bind. 
19990 4 My husband has not complained at all! 
19991 4 Great for what I need, not a professional, but works fine. 
19992 4 Great fit! 
19993 4 THE BEST AND SLICK LOOKING 
19994 4 I ve been using this everything has been great 
19995 4 Good product, have used it a lot. 
19996 4 LOVE THESE!!! Easy setup and install. Great quality product and super clean HD picture, both IR night vision and daylight. Very happy with these. 
19997 4 No problems. Got exactly what I ordered. 
19998 0 This Battery delivered a full 100% charge for the 1st few months, then dropped down to achieving only a maximum of a 50% charge... This is unacceptable as now I can no longer rely on it being a backup for my camera due to limited capacity... 
19999 4 Love it 
20000 4 Really easy to set up, you can do so with just your smart phone, some knowledge of networks/routers helps do the advanced features. 
20001 4 Best security camera there is. Motion activated, everything is recorded on SD card, but could be connected to wifi and be monitored remotely. 
20002 4 I picked this up as a spare for my 2015 Yamaha V1 Waverunner. It is is comfortable and seems to be a much better quality than the one that came with my unit. This has replaced the original as my primary lanyard. 
20003 3 Easy to handle, frame picture and carry around. 
20004 4 Great price, works well, will buy from this vendor again 
20005 4 fast shipping and good product. all mentioned item complete and works perfectly. 
20006 4 Very cool if you love science!! 
20007 4 Nikon !!!! no need to say more. 
20008 2 I liked the product but it took a long time to arrive. 
20009 4 Excellent price and works great 
20010 4 Amazing value for the price. Very high quality. If i dropped these in the ocean I would go out and buy another pair that day. 
20011 4 wonderful item, fast shipping, love them! 
20012 4 Great additional lens for my Nikon camera...great price..delivered quickly. .would buy again or recommend ! 
20013 3 I don t use it very often but it does the job. 
20014 0 The camera box arrived with a hole in the side and the camera has two chips in the paint plus small surface scratches on the face side at the shutter area. Beware on this camera. Not happy at all. 
20015 4 Love that it syncs my photos with my cloud storage. 
20016 4 WORKS AS INTENDED 
20017 2 ok 
20018 4 I HATE harsh flash effects. This will soften everything regardless of the angle of the head. Yes. it reduces effective range, but that is what software is for. 
20019 1 They were not bright enough 
20020 3 So far so good. I sold my Nikon DSLR for this and everything seems to be good. Image quality and zoom are amazing. It also has very good stabilization in the videos. 
20021 3 Very good accept for the sound. 
20022 1 had to use tin foil to make them work correctly 
20023 3 Best sandals (flip flops) I ve ever owned. However, a bit pricey. 
20024 4 The battery charger works well and SterlingTek was terrific to work with. 
20025 3 Be aware one of the items screws on counter clockwise. I returned one unit as I thought the threading was broken. 
20026 3 works good. stores easily 
20027 4 Excellent package at this price. The screw on lenses are marginal at best. The camera and zooms, however, are excellent. 
20028 4 vERY VERY GOOD!! 
20029 4 Really strong, used it on rugged trails for months now 
20030 4 Great product. Just what i needed. I have only used it for a day, but it feels well manufactured and durable. 
20031 2 Rigth rear motor (rear black propeler) does nt run fast enougth 
20032 4 Great Mic for the buck. Can t go wrong. 
20033 4 Adjustable, comfortable, and because of the rubber lines on the inside, it doesn t slip. Great! 
20034 4 Does what it says it would. 
20035 4 So far I love this lens. Nothing bad to say at all 
20036 4 I thought this would be tricky to assemble and not be sturdy enough to meet my needs, but it affixed to the lens and gives me the needed surge of handling zooming, focusing, and reading the screen with ease! 
20037 4 Great case, you can adjust it to fit any of your accessories. The camera with underwater case fits perfectly. Compact but very roomy for all your needs. 
20038 3 Woks well and is relatively easy to setup and fly... however, the lack of rotor guards is a big minus, as they break very easily (the Phantom has optional rotor guards that protect it from breaking when accidentally hitting objects like trees). 
20039 4 I am super duper SUPER happy with this seller. The lens is beyond perfection and I would think it was brand new unused if someone asked me. I would use this seller again and again! 
20040 3 A good camera strap to have. 
20041 4 Excellent 
20042 2 Not bad. Well constructed but the inner detachable walls in the main pouch don t really line up perfectly anywhere. Pretty awkward to organize. 
20043 4 a little bulky but work well 
20044 4 This works great for my gaming lighting set up. Small and portable. Great buy!! 
20045 4 Perfect for home studio. Great value, easy to set up, and seems to be sturdy. 
20046 4 I had the opportunity to use it in a recent trip to Cancún. It worked out great to give me the contrast I needed on different lighting situations. Definitely makes the editing process easier in Lightroom. I loved the final results. 
20047 0 Buyer beware you will Not receive what is pictured. You will get a totally different clamp that will Not work with the 2000 series meters. 
20048 3 It s working good 
20049 4 Great product. 
20050 0 I received this defective product with audio failed. This product can not use for car recorder due to the Polariod mount design limitation. 
20051 4 This is my first pelican and It definitely stands up to its reputation. Shipped faster than estimated delivery, made it to Illinois in 2 days. I might have to get a second one. 
20052 4 works great 
20053 4 alright 
20054 3 fine 
20055 4 Snapped on P-tap of V-lock battery with positive pressure. Repurposed this cable to feed 14.4 volts to my Sound Devices. Solid soldering and good contacts. Will buy again. 
20056 4 This is the perfect replacement/additional battery that we have been looking for. Excellent quality product - Highly recommended! 
20057 4 This accessory is cute and fun. The case gives the camera a little flare. My daughter loves the stickers. 
20058 4 THE BEST! 
20059 0 I had to return two of these, both had a defective leg clamp. Never had a problem with Manfrotto gear before but the same problem twice in a row is too much to ignore. Going to try something different. 
20060 4 My dog tested it by trying to come through the glass door and it set off the alarm. Good to know it works :) 
20061 4 Great little widget. It has 1/4 20 tapped holes on its length too but due to angle of bracket I don t see them providing any use except making it lighter. But it does exactly what I needed it to do. 
20062 4 I am very pleased with my new P600 and also with all of the goodies that came with the camera. The camera has more features then I will ever use but I am having fun trying them all out. 
20063 1 For less than 5 bucks I didn t expect much, but the overly strong smell of the rubber used to make this, makes me nauseous. Item functions great of you can get around the excessively strong rubber smell. 
20064 0 Badly directional and doesn t work from very far away. Never used it successfully. 
20065 4 Great for DIY instead of lefting a pro to fix for you. 
20066 3 I use this quite a lot. works well.... 
20067 4 Great zoom lens. Autofocus is perfect. Great for action shots at the baseball games. 
20068 4 Delivers even before expected... Can t wait to test it ! 
20069 0 Don t waste your money. None of the buttons are marked making it hard to remember which button is which. 
20070 4 great camera 
20071 4 Very pleased with this product. 
20072 2 Had to return for refund as one of the speakers wouldn t work, video is not very smooth and kept locking up on playback. Great concept that needs refining. 
20073 3 came as expected. the battery works fine. 
20074 1 low quality, died during the 1st serious session done with it. you get what you pay for :( 
20075 3 Great Product 
20076 4 Work great slide on to rails with ease 
20077 4 Good product and great performance. 
20078 3 Good quality for the price. 
20079 4 aok 
20080 4 This quality leather camera case was delivered exactly according to the description plus the unmentioned fasteners are also of good quality. The case fits my Nikon D5500 perfectly and I am pleased to recommend it. 
20081 3 Worked pretty well for looking in the cylinders of my old John Deere. Needed the mirrors to do 90deg that it does not come with. 
20082 3 Excellent deal! More stuff than I can use right now, but looking forward to learning about this amazing camera. Bag is not big enough to hold all items!!! 
20083 4 Arrived on time, and works as expected. 
20084 4 Very good product. 
20085 3 Not typically a fan of of brand products but how could you say no for the value. 4 batteries, a charger, a mini tripod and more for under $20. What a steal!! Batteries have worked fine so far. 
20086 4 still using it 3 years later 
20087 0 App wouldn t work for the people we gave it to. I plan to return it :( 
20088 4 Works as it should to be. 
20089 4 Purchased as a gift for someone in surveillance work. They love the lighter weight and clear focus of this choice out of the dozens to choose from. 
20090 4 Great case for carrying the mini monitor and some extras 
20091 0 The clip that keeps the case together broke within a week of me using it. 
20092 3 I m spoiled by a Canon XS50, but the peace of mind of having an inexpensive camera that water can t damage when kayaking is worth what I miss in control and image of photo. The photos are better than I expected and it s waterproof! 
20093 3 Keeps camera protected, perfect fit. 
20094 4 Love this! They all work wonderfully! I love to vlog and these help tremendously as it gives a wide view. 
20095 4 product worked as intended. 
20096 4 I bought this to go with my range scope since it has a canted eye piece. I can adjust this mount to hold the scope sideways and don t have to strain my neck to see perfectly. It s very stable on the ground. Love it. 
20097 4 Great! 
20098 3 Great set up. I wish it came with an owner s manual. I had to download the pdf version, which I can t carry with me when I m out in the world taking photos. But it comes with everything else I need, and takes great photos. 
20099 2 Tripod was damage. Delivery was fast 
20100 4 Good Product Works as expected 
20101 2 It s ok 
20102 4 it must have cost more to make this than I paid for it 
20103 3 Still learning all the stuff this camera is capable of.. Way more than I am.. Somewhat confusing menu system but hopefully I will learn.. Seems like good value for cost.. Excellent Leica Lens.. The long telephoto and great stabilization are real pluses.. 
20104 3 Nice Fit for my new Hero 4 Silver! 
20105 4 My mom bought this for me for my birthday and I love it! It takes great pictures and it is basically the talk of a party. Film is kind of expensive but it is reasonable. Love it! 
20106 4 Works great! 
20107 4 Convenient and easy to use! Great product!! 
20108 4 This little guy is like a tank. Very sturdy and functional for the price. 
20109 2 Good camera. Small size. 
20110 4 great 
20111 4 Works flawlessly on my X100T - no quality loss, no fringing, no autofocus struggles. Love how versatile it s made my favorite camera!!! 
20112 4 Item delivered on time and as described. 
20113 4 very good for watching baby room meanwhile we are away from home 
20114 4 It works well on lens and glass cleaning. 
20115 4 works very well 
20116 4 Battery on the gopro sucks so I had to buy this thing. 
20117 1 One battery worked, the other looked like it was charging, but never held a charge. If you can find OEM replacements, go with them if possible. 
20118 4 This thing is great 
20119 3 It is well made and sturdy. The zippers work well and does not snag. It exceeded my expectations. However, once a DSLR camera and the extra lens is in there, it gets quite bulky. 
20120 4 In love with my new camera! For the camera, the batteries, the pouch, AND the film, it was such a great price. Worked just like how I expected it would 
20121 4 Bought as a present for our son and his wife who moved over to USA with pet poodles, allows us to have a look at what they re up to anytime in perfect picture quality and sound. Can even talk to them if we wanted to. 
20122 4 This little cam is awesome! It is packed with features. And it works very well. I have compared it to a few different gopro and I will say that it s comparable on several levels! And only a fraction of the cost!! 
20123 4 very good combo 
20124 3 Great price for TWO batteries and a charger! The charger can be used in a standard US outlet or European outlet (with adapter). The car charger cord is a great addition! 
20125 4 We love it! 
20126 4 Very nice quality for the price! I was surprised at how nice it was! 
20127 4 A+ 
20128 3 It is pretty large and noticeable when mounted. It works well, easy to assemble and mount. Wish the angle was wider but for the most part it s a good item. 
20129 4 Came as advertised. Works perfect with my hero4 silver. 
20130 3 camera shots are not as clear as id expected 
20131 4 good deal! 
20132 4 Great 
20133 4 THIS WAS A VERY VERY GOOD + GREAT BUY!! I WAS SOOO RELIEVED TO SEE THIS AVAILABLE BECAUSE I RECENTLY THREW A BIG GRADUATION PARTY, AND HAD A DIY PHOTOBOOTH SET-UP, SO I REALLY REALLY NEEDED THIS FILM TO WORK, AND IT ALL TURNED OUT BEAUTIFULLY!! WAS A COMPLETE HIT!!! 
20134 4 Excelent and original product!!!. Matches perfectly in the LCD of my Alpha 77 II at the first application on it!... Five Stars!!!! 
20135 1 Lens fogged over after first rain. Get what you pay for !!!! Dont buy used !!!!! 
20136 4 Thank you very much. My lens filter arrived quickly and I m quite satisfied. 
20137 4 This is a great camera for those wanting more than just a mobile device snapshot. 
20138 4 good stuff 
20139 2 The strap is comfortable but the way it attaches to the camera did not seem secure to me. I wound up sewing it to make sure it did not become unattached. Still a good value though. 
20140 4 Smooth Transaction! Excellent Product!! A+++ 
20141 4 As advertised and they even put a signed letter in there thanking us for our purchase. Very classy and great customer service. Highly recommend!!! 
20142 4 Great product, very useful. Does not flote. 
20143 4 I really enjoy it! 
20144 4 Works and fits perfectly for my camera. Fast delivery! 
20145 4 Wonderful. Nikon D610w50mm + Two extra lens + Battery Charger + Remote + small flashlight + phone + u see it is quite versatile. 
20146 4 great 
20147 4 Worked well right out of the box 
20148 4 Product appears well made. I will be performing accuracy test on the product for proper alignment of laser during culmination. I will update review to five stars if test proves positive. Good package and shipped quickly. Thanks VITE has been working as it should. Very nice product. 
20149 4 We purchased this as a back up for our camera and choose the Canon as that is what our camera called for also we read some reviews for the knock offs which may not serve as well. 
20150 3 workds great thats why i got 4 
20151 4 PERFECT. this lil guy is awesome. i didnt need/want anything fancy....just needed something to hold up my camera that didnt cost $40+! 
20152 4 These work real well as you can use any wire for your security cameras with this set. 
20153 2 A few of the items are not the same as in the picture. Very cheap versions of the extra items ( flash, card holder, tripod, etc.) 
20154 4 So happy with this battery charger. It works well, I have already used it. I will continue to buy from you. 
20155 4 Great product. Great price. Quick delivery. Thanks. 
20156 4 Excellent 
20157 4 Really nice 
20158 4 It is a bit different from my other canons but I have learned that each time I get a new one I have to reteach myself but this one was fairly easy to pick up. 
20159 4 This monopod supports my heave lens and camera without any problem I also use the Sirui Aluminium Tilt Head L-10. 
20160 4 Works great! Good amount of accessories for the price. Green light when done. 
20161 4 Great camera, very good speed, overall quality and performance. I can t stop taking pics!. 
20162 4 Great camera. Use it to check on my dogs and it really works very well. Very easy to install. 
20163 4 I tried the camera 1 time so far. It has a clear picture and love it. Good buy and quality. 
20164 4 Great value for money. From a bit of a distance, you really can t tell they are fake. 
20165 4 Really great product and at an exceptional price. 
20166 4 Good quality, lightweight, and easy to adjust. 
20167 4 exactly what I was looking for and works great! 
20168 4 Great value 
20169 4 Great Quality - we recommend this item! 
20170 4 good 
20171 4 best 
20172 4 Great walking around lens. I also use it at work to shoot any product that doesn t require macro. 
20173 4 Compact and provides great protection. 
20174 4 this is one of my customers favorite backgrounds, it looks so real. I have used it often. 
20175 4 good quality product for the price, the case is very resistant and does great the job, about the quality of the images shot with it, a think is like 90%. lens are synthetic so, you will imagine. fit perfectly in 58mm mount. 
20176 4 Even nicer features than my DJI Phantom 2 Vision. Excellent delivery time and packaging from supplier. Truly “beyond expectations.&#34; 
20177 4 easy to use and works correctly 
20178 4 Great Camera! 
20179 4 Love this lens. Sharpest glass I ever owned. 
20180 4 My Sony was a bit small for it but it still worked great for white water rafting. Hope to use it in future travels. 
20181 4 Perfect 
20182 4 This filter does what it says...protects without introducing distortion. 
20183 1 The zipper gets jammed easy but it does it s job decently well 
20184 4 Nice unit worked very well 
20185 4 This has helped keep my SD cards safe and organized! I am very pleased with this purchase. 
20186 4 It is exactly what I ordered and what I expected 
20187 4 WOW, a lot of light for a little money... 
20188 4 awesome! 
20189 4 Got my camera quickly and set it up in less than 5 minutes! Works perfectly. 
20190 2 They work awesome but you can go to any hardware store and spend maybe .50 cents on a 1/4 inch screw and have the same product. 
20191 4 Very nice bag. Structured and holds everything I needed. Now a limited number remaining, so glad I found one on Amazon. 
20192 4 This worked perfectly for my nikon D3100. Love all the filters and especially the macro accessory kit. 
20193 4 Very good item to purchase at the time of buying a drone. 
20194 4 the Vivitar BG-E16 Battery Grip for Canon EOS 7DMKII was received in it orginal quality package. The grip was easy to install and use.allows me to take many photos than with the use of one battery, i recommend this Vivitar BG-E16 Battery Grip for Canon EOS 7D... to others 
20195 4 This is more camera than I ve ever had. I m still learning how to use it, but the auto mode has gotten me started rather easily. 
20196 4 Love it, my second one,- does all I need and for the price , one cannot beat it. Newer ones by all manufac have more bells and whistles, all depends what you need and want. AHK 
20197 4 works well! just what I needed for my Canon 
20198 3 Did the job. Only thing I d get alongside is some lights. Get some really strong lights, since some small desk lamps just didn t cut it. Otherwise, it s great for beginners who are trying to get into photography. 
20199 4 Holds a Nikon 650 with a 18-200 telephoto lens. Has a hard bottom that protects everything well. Like it and have used several different bags for camera & lens only. 
20200 1 I wasn t that pleased with this used camera. My camera (same as above) printed much better pictures until I dropped it. This one every pic is blurry and there is a rainbow that shows up and you have to wait until it clears to take a pic. 
20201 1 It breaks very easy. 
20202 4 (-: 
20203 4 It takes great pictures and video. I am impressed. 
20204 3 ok 
20205 2 My 8 year old loves this but the camera was broken (wires were not properly attached). 
20206 4 Great bag i love it 
20207 3 TALL...for someone that is 6 foot + tall this is a nice tripod so you don t have to bend as much. Only thing it doesn t have is spikes in the feet if it had those this would be perfect. Smooth operation and easy adjustments. 
20208 2 this is a fake SJcam but it still works. i was surprised when the wifi actually worked but you have to read instructions to figure out how to use it and for the pin. camera does not do well with fast moving shots but besides that its great. 
20209 4 Bought these for my wife for travel. She bought me a set a few years ago, really like them, powerful, lightweight, easy to pack. 
20210 4 Great case! Perfect as a carry-on when flying. 
20211 0 Returned due to inability to steer correctly. Also, it was used when we received it. 
20212 4 Exactly as described 
20213 4 The product was absolutely exactly as described and met or exceeded all expectations. 
20214 4 Works as expected. After many wild trips to patagonia, my case is doing very well keeping my camera dry and clean. 
20215 4 Better than expected and better than OEM. 
20216 4 Highly Recommended! 
20217 4 Best value package available! 
20218 4 My best buy last time. 
20219 3 Fits my EOS camera well and screws firmly into the AstroTech 2&#34; Field Flattener I m using it with. It has a firm lockup and positive release, both of which are great features to have in the dark while using the camera on a telescope. 
20220 4 You want a great quality camera that s fun to play with... This is it. Best quality and so much fun to play with 
20221 4 This is quite a good deal on items you want to have on hand if you buy a Canon Powershot camera! Excellent service, great delivery, very good mix of accessory products. 
20222 4 I am very pleased with this bag. High quality bag. 
20223 4 Works perfect, especially for $5. 
20224 4 Excellent! I thought I d never be able to use my portable picture maker again until I found this! Thank you!!!!! 
20225 3 Great deal. You just cannot have enough batteries or chargers for your electronics. 
20226 4 Perfect. 
20227 4 Very nice lens. 
20228 0 WOW, took 3 weeks to receive, then when I get it it is not even the same product.... everything is in Chinese. DO NOT BUY! 
20229 4 Great Lens for my Real Estate Business! 
20230 4 Bought this to have an extra one for my kit lens when I want to detach both lenses from the body for storage. 
20231 4 I love, I have had it for some time now and I have no issues with it. 
20232 4 great charger 
20233 4 I RECENTLY BOUGHT THIS SAME ONE AND LIKED IT SO MUCH I BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE! 
20234 2 This is decent, alittle too thick on the padding. but over all was descent. 
20235 3 Great stuff but pretty pricey. 
20236 4 great camera 
20237 4 Replacing the exact set and don t recall them being so right to start. Hopefully break in well. Soles on my old ones just starting to wear after two years of wearing 3-7 days a week. Top side worn as you d expect from heavy use. 
20238 4 Not much to say here. It worked and did not lose my GoPro. 
20239 4 great 
20240 3 Very sturdy. Met my expectations. 
20241 4 Worked just fine. Thanks 
20242 0 If im paying $1200 for a drone and it is supposed to be the best on the market i should have to deal with b.s. of having to update it. It should be ready to go right away 
20243 4 It is very good pic quality even at night. I am waiting to buy one more if price can be a little lower. 
20244 4 Best 
20245 4 Couldn t be happier with these! Can t beat it for the price! Works every time and haven t had an issue with it! 
20246 0 Does not fit the d750. The top piece needs to be much larger and it is not protecting it all the way. Do not buy this for the Nikon d750 
20247 0 Stick paper on back is terrible. Unit falls off! I ordered two of these and what a mistake that was. Also not that sensitive. I would not but this again. 
20248 0 Although delivery and packaging were perfectly fine, and apparently there are no scratches outside the case, inside my &#34;Brand New&#34; Pelican 1510 Case has a terrible, terrible cigarette smoke smell! The foam inside smells like complete smoke. I wonder if this is actually brand new. 
20249 0 not as advertised 
20250 4 Bought 3 units and they all are working great hope to buy more in the future. 
20251 2 It s alright. 
20252 4 the best night and day 
20253 4 Good 
20254 4 Works as expected 
20255 4 nice 
20256 1 I got this camera for the huge optical zoom feature. However, part way through a vacation in Europe, the camera locked up and stopped working. It is locked in the open position, but won t turn off, on or reset. Bad time to break. 
20257 0 They told me it would work for GoPro Hero 1 and it doesn t, very dissaponting! 
20258 4 This wired remote shutter release works very well and can be locked on for long &#34;bulb&#34; exposures. 
20259 3 So far photos are good, but it has a long delay in turning the screen on. That can be annoying when you miss shots while waiting for the screen to turn on. 
20260 2 The outdoor connection cable and camera wire need to be cover by duck tape. It is burned when wet. Mine one camera out of 4 was burned. I don t know if I can get a warranty to replace it or not. 
20261 2 Has very slow shutter speed 
20262 4 Very easy to set up, and I am able to watch my baby while im at work and she is at home with our Nanny. 
20263 3 Works well. 
20264 4 I ve tried several cases and this is the easiest to grab the camera. No more struggling to get the camera out of the bag. 
20265 4 This works really well ask a baby cam. We can now monitor our 5 months old even if we are in a different room. Great quality at a good price. We purchased it at a different store. 
20266 4 Excellent design and very comfortable to wear. Good selection and supply of dividers included. Very versatile. well shaped, etc. Can really make great use of the interior space. Superb value. 
20267 4 Excellent pair of binoculars. Light and compact - my wife has used them for the Muny Opera here In St. Louis and is thrilled with the results ! 
20268 4 Great Camera s 
20269 4 What can I say. It works. 
20270 4 Awesome kit! It was exactly like the discription, very fast shipping and great quality !!! 
20271 3 Does the job, nothing fancy. I realized too late that I should have bought the one with the remote, but that s no fault of this device. 
20272 4 great 
20273 4 Well made, attractive and adds a convenient handle rib to the front. Only negative is it adds to the height of the camera. 
20274 4 Very good！ 
20275 4 Perfect! 
20276 1 I bought this and immediately returned it. The head is made out of plastic and does not sit level when horizontal. 
20277 4 Great camera for the money 
20278 4 Hands down the best flash I have ever owned, although I wish I had waited and bought the model that has the built-in radio. Still works great with my wireless triggers. 
20279 1 Very bad 
20280 4 Spare battery for my cannon camera. It works just as good as my original 
20281 4 I had a little trouble with getting it to work with my LifeProof case for my phone at first. I tried it a second time and it works great. No complaints! 
20282 4 really nice works better than the battery that came with it 
20283 0 Pease of crap 
20284 4 Worth the price 
20285 4 Great products and price for a beginner like myself! 
20286 4 Great replacement battery 
20287 4 Great product 
20288 1 Came in scratched/chipped and clip broke immediately. Video is ok sound is horrible. I use it as a dash cam. So sound wasn t important. Kept it because it as cheap. 
20289 4 Shall i say more....it s an oem battery and it surpasses all imitators. Good price here on AMAZON 
20290 4 Works great. Have yet to field test them 
20291 4 great price and fit and quality 
20292 4 Clear view, not happy about case 
20293 0 Broke almost immediately after being delivered to may home. 
20294 2 It came without the base that attaches to the belt. 
20295 1 Most pictures came out blurry. My old 16.1 mp camera was much better. All this camera did was prove to me that there is more to pictures than megapixels. Videos came out fine though. 
20296 4 Pictures come out clear and quality of product is good! 
20297 4 Great product, great price 
20298 4 Good buy 
20299 3 Its very easy to work, its just what I needed! 
20300 4 Is works fine 
20301 4 Great fun. Had to re-bind the wifi so it worked but after that, awesome photos and videos 
20302 4 Nice an useful 
20303 4 Love this lens! 
20304 0 Well worth what I paid for it and it was so easy to set up! I ll be getting a few more. May 2016, NOT anymore...they updated and now both my cameras always say offline and will not connect. 
20305 4 Good product, good price. I like the rapid charger, it takes less time than charging on the computer and having the 3 back up batteries comes in handy. 
20306 4 Perfect for what I was needing to hold my Video camera while riding. 
20307 4 Great buy!!! 
20308 4 I like it 
20309 4 i totally loved this lens..but it only lasted about 3 years..then the focus element stopped working..:/ so i sold it to someone that was willing to have it fixed..it was too expensive for me..so i don´t have it anymore..someone else is loving it now..:) 
20310 4 Great case for my new camera and accessories. Plenty of room and easy to organize. 
20311 4 Great camera, easy to set up. 
20312 0 Very disappointed. These glasses would not hold a charge. 
20313 4 Perfect. 
20314 4 Good. 
20315 3 This light weight tripod is exactly what I was looking for. I record presentations using an iPod Touch, and this tripod is small enough to pack, tall enough to see over people s heads and strong enough to handle the weight of the device. 
20316 1 Cheap quality 
20317 4 A great camera. It s going to take me a while to learn how to use it properly but I m very pleased with it. 
20318 4 Good buy. 
20319 4 great battery 
20320 4 The camera s sensitivity is amazing since I can see even with dim lighting. 
20321 1 Tried it on a Nikon D3300 and it washed everything out and had a very strong flash even on the lowest setting. Its a nice idea for a flash, but didn t work for me. 
20322 0 I took about 300 pictures during the first half of my trip to Norway just fine. The next time I turned on the camera one third of the screen had black bars across. I have had the camera less than one week. I am not impressed. 
20323 4 Works, fits my nex. 
20324 1 I have long used Nikon but thought i would try Canon. I am not happy with the quality of my pics. I will be switching back and selling this one. 
20325 4 Just got it today, initial testings looks positive, will update after the filed test. 
20326 4 Excellent product! Great deal. 
20327 4 Great product 
20328 2 No zoom feature. Otherwise works well 
20329 3 Charder for my battery just fine. The materials that the charger are made from don t seem to be the best quality but it works just fine. It charges quickly and easy to store with it s size. 
20330 4 Good ítem!! Thanx 
20331 4 Very great camera for the price! Would recomend to anyone. 
20332 4 Oh my god,twice as cheap as the Canon type and oh so good. If this is what you need stop now and buy,buy,buy. 
20333 4 Yes it was in very good condition. Thanks 
20334 4 Love the lens. Works.just as expected

20336 4 good 
20337 3 Great camera 
20338 2 I mostly love this camera; however, I always have difficulties transferring the files to the computer. The USB doesn t work and the wi fi works most of the time but is very slow and skips files sometimes. 
20339 2 excellent item, solved my problem 
20340 4 Very goos 
20341 4 I m New to dslr photography, these lenses & case appears good quality and fair price. Always look to this seller first for my needs. 
20342 4 Very good 
20343 4 Great set!! Everything fits into the bag and easy to use! The lights are wonderful and take great pics! 
20344 4 Love this camera. It s a bit of a dinosaur, but the lens is top notch quality and has a huge zoom capacity. Easy to use. 
20345 4 Excelente 
20346 4 Great Buy ! 
20347 4 love it 
20348 3 Overall good product. However, the speed disconnect is wobbly when attached and the knob to turn the mounting screw quickly broke. These issues did not address the functionality too much. 
20349 4 Thes are a bigger than expected size and I love them! They do not smudge or smear on your lense. Clean and scratch free. 
20350 2 Stand is cheaply made only used it a couple times and one of the pins came out of the leg. I have it rigged for now. Spend a little more for a better quality product. 
20351 4 Lightweight and compact design with great power. Well done. 
20352 4 Great product!! 
20353 3 happy 
20354 3 This product works as expected and is well built. 
20355 4 Used camera on a trip to Canada. Wonderful films! 
20356 4 works great ... I actually purchased yet another so can adapt (through modification) old Bay 60 filters to my prime nikon lens that I use for scenics. Good price for what you get. 
20357 2 clasp and handle are cheesy, ready to fall off 
20358 2 Ohh man! Missing parts in the first fly! 1 in 4 motors stop working! I have to buy the new replacement! The camera no good at all, it s too slow and too dark, need upgrades to 12.Mb 
20359 0 Doesn t work! It was advertise that it will work with Samsung Google Nexus and it doesn t! 
20360 4 It works very well. There is even an extra battery that I didn t expect. 
20361 4 I have so many old slides from the early nineties that I am able to view with ease now. The back light on this Medalight viewer is nice and bright!!! 
20362 4 Works as advertised. 
20363 4 This product is awesome! I use this to clamp onto the side of an L bracket on my D750. It gives me another hot shoe adapter for a profoto B1 trigger so I can use off camera lighting alongside a speedlight flash. It is built solid and feels reliable. 
20364 4 Awesome! Works perfectly. High quality, sturdy. 
20365 0 It was broken when it arrived. 
20366 4 I love this tripod I used it for all my recordings and photo shoot ♥ 
20367 4 Seems good quality & worked for me. Good price. 
20368 4 No reason not to love it, simple enough! 
20369 4 Very Well Satisfied with my purchase. 
20370 4 amazing bag. Fits all my drone gear plus my a7s and 3 lenses and atomos shogun, all batteries.. goddang this is a good bag.. EVERYTHING! audio equipment too 
20371 3 Excellent so far 
20372 4 Excellent 
20373 3 Good camera for the price 
20374 4 PERFECT for quadrotor video recording paired with FPV. My gopros are a bit too heavy to put on my 250 racer, so this was a no brainer. Quality is on par with my hero 2 and hero3 silver. Size and weight is great and the quality is awesome too. 
20375 4 Sweet price for a bunch of handy power adapters! 
20376 3 I love this case. Hold my digital camera and extra batteries in a well-protected bag. 
20377 1 Will only support a small compact camera. 
20378 4 Holy moley this camera is a champ!!! Its so clear!! So many features; especially manually! Makes me seem like a pro :). 
20379 4 We use it to clean lenses that we rent. Its easy to use and has enough &#34;air power&#34; to remove normal debris. 
20380 1 Crappy video Quality. The 720 statement while technically true makes it sound like it can record HD video. However, the video and picture quality isn t even as good as standard definition 480i tv. 
20381 4 Great, met all of my expectations 
20382 4 Hi. Quick delivery. Product conforms. Thanks 
20383 3 Good product! 
20384 3 I was surprised at the quality of this - I ve had it on my camera for 2.5 years now and it s still holding up like a champ! 
20385 4 Great deal for backup and replacement batteries. 
20386 0 Would not hold a charge returned it Love Amazon they took care of me 
20387 4 Perfect for all my pictures 
20388 4 I love it, excellent bubble free screen protector, if you follow the instruction you can apply it in proper place- no hassle, delivery was before time, very good service. 
20389 2 Good camera but no alerts to my phone at work, sent back and got another that did more the Wi-Fi. 
20390 4 Super good and best part of this item the price 
20391 1 To expensive 
20392 1 They did not meet my expectations. They are not really what I would call microfiber, they are not as soft. 
20393 4 great case 
20394 3 A fine lens for a good price, well done Adorama. 
20395 3 Great product for the price point.. they give off a nice natural light and can be changed many heights and directions. Quite pleased. 
20396 4 takes great pictures but flash is cheaply made 
20397 4 Filter performed as expected. I m quite happy with it. 
20398 0 The battery leaked and the camera spoils. 
20399 4 Good Communication, very nice product, Item as described A+++ Seller 
20400 4 If you don t have steady hands or can t just pull a piece off to look at then this ain t for you. 
20401 4 I will order them again when needed. 
20402 4 great value and excellent product 
20403 1 these make an incredibly loud cheap sound, making it obvious that they are fake. 
20404 4 Loved it for the time I had it, became obsolete when the IPhone showed up, but worked well! 
20405 4 Pretty good looking and nicely made case! 
20406 1 its ok. ive had better 
20407 4 these blocks are so cute. the price is great. i didn t want blocks that looked too childish, as i knew i would be using them for years 
20408 4 For true color, quick setup, portability, must have for professionals. 
20409 4 Frame worked great. It held our GoPro on our car from NJ to FL! 
20410 4 Perfect fit and as good as the Canon version. 
20411 3 Works great! Awesome pricing! 
20412 4 Used this in the field with good results. 
20413 4 Works as expected 
20414 2 works as it should 
20415 3 Works well and doesn t interfere with controls 
20416 4 The latest model of Zhiyun,it seems great! I d like to try it! 
20417 4 Great kit and camera. I only wish it came with a floating handle for taking in the water. If you drop it, that type of handle actually floats with the camera. If they would add that handle to this kit.....it would be perfect! 
20418 3 Works just fine. I won t say it shoots every time, but it s pretty consistent. 
20419 3 Pudiera ser mejor. 
20420 4 Gift for my Father-in-law, he was very pleased. 
20421 4 Exactly as described, arrived promptly, well packed. New batteries have significantly greater run life than original equipment. Charger works well with the benefit of car adapter and european plug adapter as bonuses. 
20422 4 Beautiful Picture Quality. Decent stock lens. Highly recommend picking up additional lenses. 
20423 4 Love! Great underwater and above water pictures! 
20424 4 I love the case. I am glad that I can finally protect my camera. It s really a cute looking case. 
20425 2 Hard to use and focus. 
20426 4 I m using this adapter to mount my DJI Ronin base-plate. It s not a perfect fit, in that the safety mechanism doesn t function correctly, but it slides in and locks down tight. Nice budget option. 
20427 4 Worked fine 
20428 4 Great, just what we needed 
20429 4 Cool!!! Love it! 
20430 4 Good 
20431 4 Perfect fit on Hero 4 and good quality. 
20432 3 Works great on glass. Has some trouble sticking to other car surfaces. 
20433 3 Overall the product was exactly as described. The directions/manual that it came with, however was not very helpful. 
20434 4 Helped get pictures off of a discarded phone. 
20435 4 Had everything I wanted and more very pleased 
20436 2 It needs a bit of some flex for the screw to tighten down the camera to where it won t move. Other than that, it is built well and is heavy duty. 
20437 4 LOVE IT 
20438 3 Compared to the original one, it seems weaker. 
20439 4 This tripod is great ! Nice and sterdy amd I can count on it for anything. 
20440 4 Super portable and great image quality - awesome for hiking! 
20441 4 no complaints 
20442 4 Everything was great! 
20443 3 nice design, this would not fall off the camera as other s have, but I m sending it back because I d have to take it off for wide angle shots because you can see a portion of the hood in the shot 
20444 4 +1000 
20445 0 Did not as described or pictured. Does not come with bnc-bnc connectors. Comes with bnc-male rca. 
20446 4 It is the best microfiber lens leaner I ever used in the past 10 years. 
20447 0 I cannot give an accurate description of how well this device works. In the product details it clearly states that it works for the Nikon d750, which the MC-36B is supposed to, however the unit that arrived is the MC-DC2 for Nikon D90/3100/7000/5200/5100 
20448 2 Was good while it lasted, but not very durable 
20449 3 GOOD PRODUCT 
20450 4 works great, a little different than normal, but not a bad thing, very happy with shoulder strap 
20451 4 Fast shipping, easy installation and inexpensive. We installed them in every window in our house. It makes enough noise for unexpected guest. 
20452 4 Works like a charm 
20453 4 good quality 
20454 4 Camera works like it should, the only think I didn t like was that the app for foscam are not to good 
20455 4 It is what it is , great material great price 
20456 4 Price was right. As a backup battery we will see how it performs in the future 
20457 0 Siren cannot be heard @10 away Replaced batteries 3 different new ones two different brands three different packages 
20458 4 My teenage daughter loves this! 
20459 4 Perfectly designed for it s purpose with superbly quality. Works great with Desmond DBC-01 RC2 Compatible Clamp. 
20460 0 Not get to what I expected 
20461 4 Awesome. Very clear and work very very good at night. I put one on the front porch and there is no, I mean no light out there, it s still clear as a bell. I love them and would recommend them to my friends. 
20462 4 At last this is what my Gopro3 was missing a good lasting battery that doesn t drain by itself 
20463 4 I love these old style cameras and although the video quality is not great, I just like the style. 
20464 2 Price for this type of item 
20465 4 Fit my canon camera just fine and has plenty of strength for being quite a small chord. 
20466 4 They work so well I now have 4. No nonsense triggers. 
20467 4 Vincent did an excellent job setting up this camera. It seems a complicated procedure, but he zipped right through. I have not had a chance to try the cam out yet, but I was happy with the installation process. 
20468 4 Perfect 
20469 4 perfect 
20470 4 Haven t used these yet, but the first set of 50 were great. Grandkids had a ball taking pictures 
20471 4 Worked like a charm! I did not have to buy a special camera, just used an old one! 
20472 4 Very good 
20473 4 Needed for Santa pictures - worked out great. 
20474 4 Item came quickly and as described. Bought this 5 weeks ago. Straps are holding up well. 
20475 1 I could not give 5 stars, because the screwing mechanism was lose, and basically the upper and lower halves of the pen did not remain attached. But the camera worked. 
20476 4 Great deal! Great delivery time! Thank you! 
20477 3 Feels fake but it works well 
20478 4 excellent 
20479 3 Great for price but definitely not high quality material. It does what it s meant to do. 
20480 4 No problems with product and/or delivery. Works as described. 
20481 4 Perfect size for my GoPro. Now I want other sizes. 
20482 0 Pain in the butt to hook into your wireless, useless if you re trying to see outside at night in front of a window. OK for interior use only! The mobile phone app is junk and always kicks out on you. 
20483 0 Not an infrared filter - it is basically a neutral density filter - you can see light through the filter. 
20484 0 Did not like this product at all. I thought maybe the camear was damaged so I reordered needless to say, I was unable to that to work. 
20485 3 Works well and value for money. 
20486 0 camera was not reliable and just not to be trusted. i could be standing in room, jumping and moving around for several minutes and it would show me still sitting on couch from 10 minutes previous and act like everything was great. not great! sorry, but just not reliable. 
20487 2 so far so good 
20488 4 Buen producto ! 
20489 4 Seems to work fine. Great price 
20490 4 Fully compatible. Works great. 
20491 4 great product and is great at the price goes every where with him. 
20492 4 Works fine and doesn t wear down too fast. 
20493 0 Don t waste your money! 
20494 0 HORRIBLE TOOK TO GERMANY PICTURES CAME OUT HORRIBLE 
20495 4 Good 
20496 4 Great Product 
20497 0 batterys fit to tight in charger slot that makes them very hard to get in or out. 
20498 4 excellent product. 
20499 4 Worked great as replacement for old contacts 
20500 3 Everything came right away, I have used the head mount, floating handle, suction cup mount and the handle bar mount. It s all worked great so far, but right when I took the tripod out, one of the legs broke off and it seems really flimsy 
20501 4 These transmitters and receivers work perfectly on my Nikon D810 
20502 3 This is a decent scope, especially for the money. However, I upgraded tot he Celestron Regal 100mm and it is considerably more clear at all magnifications. If you have the coin, skip this one, and go for the upgrade model. 
20503 4 Camera arrived quickly and meets all my expectations. 
20504 2 ok for beginner video 
20505 4 Great semi-professional lens, especially for the price. Very fast focus. I use it on a D5200. 
20506 3 Yet again I have had to replace my lens cap after it has falled off the lens and been lost, but this time they have changed the design. I believe that the cap design is better - it appears to have a tighter grip on the lens. Time will tell!! 
20507 0 Film keeps getting stuck in back on my camera and wont print out photos. help? Very disappointed on the waste of money. 
20508 4 Worked perfect for my Cannon sx280 hs 
20509 1 Takes a llooonng time to find the right adjustment for your camera, and the product alone is quite heavy. My arms start hurting after only 15min of straight use. 
20510 4 We think it works great and brings things in much closer. 
20511 0 very disappointed very cheaply made will not work on my pc works on my dads pc hard to focus very light weight and unstable seller sent me the 200x not the 300x I ordered 
20512 1 It does not hold the charge as well as my original canon batteries, which are quite old. 
20513 3 Excellent filter. Better than my previous filters which scratched up easily. 
20514 0 This battery is not compatible with Polaroid t730. I am not planning to buy another battery, as I thought this brand would have been compatible compared to the other, also purchased from Amazon. 
20515 4 Works great! 
20516 4 This is a great option to protect my lens and to filter the uv rays. This is exactly what I expected and it is a great value compared to similar lens filters. 
20517 4 Great little charger. 
20518 0 I have had this camera for about a year now and it quit working. It would get moisture in it and wouldn t turn on when I wanted it to. I wasn t very impressed with it. 
20519 3 It is great cable wire but not what we needed at the time but, we did find another use for it by changing out the connector ends. Thank you once again Amazon for such quick delivery. 
20520 4 Great product 
20521 4 Great lens 
20522 4 Got this as a gift for my sil...amazing quality camera for the price! 
20523 0 These do NOT fit the Sony NEX-3NL camera. Otherwise they seem like nice lenses 
20524 1 Worked Great for about 2 weeks, not wont go up past about 1/3 of the way. If I reset and move the camera up my self a few times it works for a day then quits again. =( Really liked this camera too. 
20525 3 Product was as advertised. 
20526 4 Love it. If the package could include a gopro locking screw that would be perfect. 
20527 3 No complaints! 
20528 4 Great camera and customer service. 
20529 4 GREAT PRODUCT FOR BEGINERS! 
20530 4 very good 
20531 4 AAAAA+++++ 
20532 4 Brandon in technical support was great, he was able to install the camera in minutes and was very polite and helpful. Now the camera works with no problems. 
20533 4 Great professional camera! It was great experience. It included everything that you need to do perfect pictures. Delivery was in time, everything was great. 
20534 4 perfect size and very light, will love it on upcoming vacation. My Nikon P600 is perfect size in this bag with room for extra batteries and cards. Thank you. 
20535 3 Pretty easy to use, not sure how or if it can be used without Wi-fi as in can be used cellular and it s pretty slow to move the camera via wi-fi but it s pretty cool and cheap. 
20536 4 Just needed it and arrived on ti,e good quality. 
20537 0 The USB wire doesnt fit well the charger the battery doesnt charge, bad experience see picture, part of the USB stays out of the charger i dont know if thisbis normal but it doesnt work 
20538 0 Dead on arrival. Tried it with multiple flashes, fresh new batteries, and then a different set of fresh new batteries. Requested a replacement or refund from Yongnuo and they refused (so much for standing behind a warranty). Risky purchase, poor customer service. You ve been warned. 
20539 4 Just what I needed and it got to me so fast I swear I blinked and bam I had it. Great battery and price. Do not waste your time shopping around, here it is and at the click of a button it is yours and in your hands fast! 
20540 2 Worked from June to February and then because it is not waterproof, it rusted where the batteries are and quit working. 
20541 4 worked fine 
20542 4 This is the nicest bag - fit my Nikon and 2 large lenses plus batteries and charger. It looks beautiful and feels like my purse ( it also fits all of my purse stuff). Earth tone colors - perfect for me. 
20543 3 Loving it :) 
20544 3 I think this item is very durable and the price is also reasonable. However, the reach of the mount is a little short because it consists of two separated sticks, not three sticks. Anyway, it was useful for my diving. 
20545 4 Excellent service and product. I received my product timely and the item works well. 
20546 0 unfortunately the remote does NOT work, the right button is so low set that you cannot access it and the left hand button works only occasionally. I need to return this item, so please send return mailing label. 
20547 1 Even tightened all of the way down, the arms still move around. The result is a shaky video, and unreliable angles as the mount is move around (mounted on my motorcycle). I would look for a different brand. 
20548 4 Best point and shoot I have ever encountered! Pictures look as good as my Nikon DSLR 3100. More settings than I will ever need, but there if I want them. If you are on the fence about this camera just go ahead and get one before they run out. 
20549 4 It is inexpensive and works great..... what more can you ask from a light diffuser? 
20550 2 Not very well made. ....same thing with this pen. I have no more ink and have no way or replacing it....thanks seller. 
20551 3 These fit decently, but you can tell that they are not perfect. Don t quite &#34;click&#34; on the way they should and when the two won t screw together (bad sign). 
20552 4 Makes the slides gook great. 
20553 3 Nice little camera. Bought it to take basic vacation pics. Got a water proof case as well and took pics with it underwater. 
20554 3 I mean, what can you say? It is inexpensive and it works. Arrived when it should have. 
20555 4 Perfect little bag for on the go!!! 
20556 4 Nice product so far. I ve been having it for a week now and I have no problem with it. 
20557 2 These might be nice binoculars for viewing the stars, but they are terrible for viewing Dolphins from our patio. I guess the Dolphins are just too fast. 
20558 2 Good product but arrived without instructions 
20559 2 Don t tweak it too hard or the joints pop out. Can be snapped back but annoying. 
20560 4 Perfect fit for my 5 gal. bottles. Nice and tight. 
20561 2 great 
20562 4 very sturdy, works on uneven ground 
20563 4 battery works great with my camera 
20564 4 Amazing product!! 
20565 4 Everything arrived ok! Great product. 
20566 3 Awesome mounts 
20567 4 Great price!! 
20568 4 working very good 
20569 4 Almost no ghosts or anything. Cleans with ease by breathing and wiping with a microfiber cloth. Hoya HDs are the best. 
20570 4 Nice lightweight & adjustable! Very, very, very bright ont he highest setting. This will also take AA batteries or other various camera batteries. Includes the shoe/tipod mount. Very happy with the product. 
20571 0 In possible to navigate to set it up 
20572 4 Nice size and works as intended. Light weight so I always have it in my camera bag. Of the times I didn t bring it, I regret it. 
20573 0 Have you read setup instructions for wireless camera? OMG -- IP configuration required ..... give me a break it s 2015. Sending box back today! 
20574 4 Good, cheap insurance.... 
20575 3 Smallervthan I thought, but it works. 
20576 4 excellent 
20577 4 No words to explain how much I like it. 
20578 4 Very clear and good resolution. Does very close up pics. Color is accurate. 
20579 4 Solid construction and smart design. A great mono pod for a decent price. 
20580 3 They did a good job, film is of good quality. I would recommend this company to friends. 
20581 2 Acts funny in my camera, like it s not sure if this is an OE battery. holds a charge as I would expect. 
20582 4 This is a good quality versatile mount that arrives in nice packaging. Good value overall and works well 
20583 4 Fast delivery and as described, thanks. 
20584 4 Great product 
20585 2 I have 2 sj4000 knock off. The picture is great but the sound really sucks. But i use it on a quadcopter, so i don t need good sound. If you are going to record sounds don t bother buying this thing. 
20586 4 Very sturdy and light. A good fit. 
20587 0 Doesn t work how I expected. The night shoot is mainly why I purchased this camera and it works horribly. It was not checked before sold because it still had the last owners person pictures and video. The sound quality is also awful. 
20588 4 great 
20589 4 Delivered on time and as per description 
20590 4 Great camera for the price. We take it on vacation so we don t have to use our phones. 
20591 1 Does Not do what instructions say it does. Have not being able to set the motion detection. 
20592 2 No comments 
20593 4 Perfect for my needs. I am not a professional but take lots of pictures for friends and family. 
20594 4 Sturdy 
20595 4 I really love these styles that they come in and instead of having plain white pictures spice it up with these border stickers! 
20596 4 Happy with the shipping, the product and the price. Highly recommend! 
20597 4 Perfect gift for collecting memories. Good Value and Quality 
20598 3 Nice telescope. Setup was pretty simple. The star alignment process required some time to get it right but all in all we like the telescope and good for us novice. 
20599 4 Great and really works. 
20600 4 The battery worked out great. I purchased the battery as a spare for my lecia v-lux 4 which is the same as the Leica battery at half the price with the same specs. 
20601 0 The instructions are impossible to follow. When you call Tech Support, you they re angry and condescending. In the end, they can t help you and your stuck with a very expensive piece of crap. 
20602 4 I ve had my Hello Kitty camper for about a month or so and I LOVE IT!!! I recieved it fast and it was just prefect!!! 
20603 4 This is a perfect product what I am searching. Its awesome product and very easy to use. Don t miss like this product and its very cheap cost they are offering. Its looking very nice and very easy to handle with remarkable comfort. 
20604 4 On time and as described. Fits perfectly 
20605 0 I cannot off load any images what a waste of money 
20606 4 Really relieves the pressure around my neck on long wedding days carrying a heavy body and lens. 
20607 4 Well made cap. Lost mine during a basketball game and I am very happy that this cap looked and felt like the original cap. 
20608 3 Works perfectly, charges in Canon charger. Fast delivery. The only reason I didn t give 5 stars is that I don t know how long the battery will last, other than that don t hesitate to buy 
20609 2 It needs to be charged too much. 
20610 3 Good case but not as convenient as I thought it would be. 
20611 0 Doesn t fit newer hero s 
20612 2 not smooth! 
20613 1 Just ok 
20614 4 Great experience 
20615 3 Product is great for the price. it arrived quickly and suction cup adheres to the windshield very securely. The plastic screw mount is a bit flimsy when tightening the screw thread to camera but does the job for my small action camera. 
20616 4 Absolutely fantastic. 
20617 4 Does what it says on the tin. Offers better grip and good protection for the camera. 
20618 4 Nice!!! Much sturdier than the cheezy tripods often packed with inexpensive photo accessories. The ball mount actually locks tightly! 
20619 4 sme as gopro 
20620 4 I was lucky enough to not get a fake battery. Watch out for that. That s all I can really say, it works just like my original T3i battery. 
20621 4 Got it as a gift for my daughter and she loves it. 
20622 4 Bought this because of the price and I love it. Exactly what I was looking for to diffuse the onboard flash on my camera. Easy to use and folds up nicely. 
20623 4 HSS works with Cheetahstand CL-360 
20624 4 Great buy 
20625 3 The side screw has no function and I managed to work it with an old threaded rod I found. 
20626 4 Good service and everything in perfect working conditions 
20627 4 Light weight but yet sturdy. Fluid head 
20628 4 Awesome just what I ordered thank you very much works wonderful 
20629 4 Exactly what I ordered. The cable meets my needs perfectly. Thank you... 
20630 2 Is very good pictures are great and clear day or night but the back round you hear when the speak is on must be fixed 
20631 4 Great kit full of useful components 
20632 4 excellent 
20633 2 Aperture ring is rough - a so so so product 
20634 4 Really love these triggers! The best feature in my opinion is the ability to control your flash power on the controller itself. Saves so much time! 
20635 2 excellent item, very useful for whatever you want, 
20636 0 Incredibly difficult to use. Minimal directions. Photos either did not display, or displayed upside down. I spent a significant amount of time reformatting photos and rotating them only to have the frame not save any of my work. Not worth the trouble. 
20637 4 This case is part of the reason why I wanted the Nikon 1. I loved the sleek design and the fact that it protected the camera without making it huge. We were happy that this fit inside my husband s cargo pocket when we were at an amusement park. 
20638 0 Charged the batteries without a problem, but when I put them into my Nikon D3200, the camera would not accept them as usable. So, they are useless to me. Money down the drain. 
20639 4 This gives the camera a better overall grip, making it more comfortable to hold and less movement (in my opinion) when pressing the shutter down. It s not a perfect match to the color of the camera but so close, you won t notice unless you re really looking. 
20640 4 it came 5 or 6 dys early the case is very durable protects camera from many things even knives(I was bored and I m a guy :-P) the camera is great especially for the low price the mounts work and it is definetly waterproof in case 
20641 4 This battery grip was well worth the money. It holds 2 batteries and works great for various picture positions, without the need to contort your hands. 
20642 4 great! 
20643 4 I like this so well I have one for every flash I have (5). 
20644 3 Im old fashioned! Miss the instructions on paper.... 
20645 4 The case is great for my compact camera and accessories. 
20646 4 it work very well and is preciely wha i needed.,good value for the money 
20647 4 i love it 
20648 4 My new lens came right away. Due to the hot weather, I haven t been able to use it much, but I m looking forward to enjoying it when the cooler temps get here. Thank you. 
20649 2 Very easy set up. App has an easy to work with interface. Night mode produces clear visuals. Very little lag within normal lighted visuals. 
20650 4 pretty good ofr watching birds 
20651 4 Works well. I bought several sets. monitor both the front and back of house. be careful though once you add a camera to a channel on one monitor it cannot be added to the same channel on another monitor 
20652 4 I`m pro wadding photographer w. 20 years of experience I just purchased that one to have extra lens in my case and I have exactly same lens made in Japan .... Compare both of them no difference in the quality 
20653 4 Excellent product 
20654 4 Good deal. Thannks.. 
20655 4 great value and excellent product 
20656 4 Will return to seller. 
20657 4 I ve been using it for 2 weeks, and i love it. I would buy this again, as well as recomend it to friends. 
20658 0 Would not even lift off once. Bought extra batteries, fully charged them, nothing. Rotors spun but never lifted off. Thanks for ruining a six year olds birthday. 
20659 0 Not terribly professional except for the company logo embossed on the cheap plastic tie. 
20660 3 Holds all the accessories for the camera. 
20661 4 With the kit lens, it fits fine even over the viewfinder. Just don t forget to push in underneath the camera when shooting. 
20662 4 A+ would order from here again! 
20663 4 Did not come with a book manual on how to use the camera. My brother had the same camera so he was able to show me the basics but can find the user manual online. Love the camera and all the accessories that came with it. 
20664 4 works fine 
20665 2 The waterproof feature worked great, but almost all photos on land were blurry. 
20666 4 Great 
20667 4 Great camera, easy to install, works great with the app. 
20668 0 This was terrible, I had it for less than a week and one of the legs wont stay pulled down and one of the legs slides off the top connection bit very easily. You get what you pay for with this product 
20669 4 Works great and way better priced (like half) than I found in stores anywhere. 
20670 4 great transaction. Product as described 
20671 2 Pretty flimsy, doesn t realy provide much support. I wouldn t trust an expensive camera in it 
20672 4 I love this i no longer have to pocket my lense caps and hope I don t lose them or forget where I put it 
20673 3 GREAT SELLER PRODUCT WORKED GREAT 
20674 3 Thank You 
20675 4 works well 
20676 4 This monitor is everything in description plus some. I will be purchasing again. 
20677 4 Very nice glass, highly recommended. 
20678 4 Don t go flying without it! It s nice to hear the beeping while flying so you know when to come in for a landing. There s nothing like losing power while hundreds of feet in the air! 
20679 4 Love this product. Such a good product for so little investment. I m Not a professional photographer though. 
20680 3 Arrival time was as posted, merchandise as promised 
20681 4 I love this lens. While I am still learning all the ins and outs of using a prime lens, the photos I ve taken with this really jump out ... I m very excited about learning more. 
20682 4 Such a fun item. Really love flying this drone, best one out there for the money to practice with. Only wish the battery life would last longer, but still a great product!! 
20683 4 Great filter. Fits perfect. The moon looks amazing. Thank you so much for a great product. 
20684 3 The lenses and accessories are great. I only wish there were some instructions. 
20685 4 I am very happy with this purchase. 
20686 4 Works great as expected. 
20687 4 Great performance! Love it! 
20688 4 Purchased as a gift. Super big hit! Fantastic product. 
20689 4 I couldn t be happier. 
20690 2 I tested each camera before installing on exterior of my house. 1 Camera had water inside of it and does not work the other three are good. 
20691 4 Exactly what I was after. Works well 
20692 2 The stick is not sturdy enough. When at full length, it is hard to handle it and take a proper selfie 
20693 4 Fine Dvr and cameras. Nice night vision too. Just needs better documentation. 
20694 0 Didn t work with my Nikon :-( 
20695 4 danny gave me great tech support and was able to hook up my camera. The camera is clear and easy to use. 
20696 3 somehow i need to use 3 swab to completely clean my D7000 sensor. Maybe the dirt has settled too long. 
20697 4 Great product for price. Attached to lens very easy. 
20698 4 These work great and will fit on any speed light. Good value. 
20699 4 Works Perfect 
20700 3 its a cool camera. the control on the dial switch for camera mode, moves on its own while you re shooting and that sucks. otherwise i would have given it a 5 
20701 3 Does a good job during the day and night 
20702 1 The extendable Telescopi Handle turns arround with the weight of the Go Pro, its not usefull. Tripod its OK. 
20703 4 The cameras have excellent clarity. Easy to set up - when I had a small glinch Dlink tech worked with me until it was resolved. DLink has the best customer service. Thank you Allen your were so knowledgeable and patient. AR004639 
20704 4 My old camera died after around 6 years love this camera for inside the house you can place it almost any place works real nice in low light 
20705 4 Was delivered on time. Happy with the drone. 
20706 4 good picture, great price 
20707 2 it s expensive and if you want to record you must pay monthly. 
20708 4 Awesome!! Great handheld light wand. Thin and the lights are very bright. 
20709 4 I was thinking is gonna come with memory card! 
20710 2 Recording time only lasts about 3 hours 
20711 4 works. 
20712 4 This recorder is working great so far , I will keep this updated in a months 
20713 3 This recharges batteries quickly. I purchased it for a long trip where thousands of photos are likely to be taken. So far there has been no problems. 
20714 4 I liked the product, and had no trouble with the purchase. thank YoU! 
20715 4 what I needed igot 
20716 4 Great quality and value. 
20717 4 Works really well. Not to difficult to add to the flash. Folds down and fits in my camera bag perfectly 
20718 4 Batteries arrived on time and were well-packaged. They are a fraction of the price of Canon batteries and do the job. I ll definitely do business with GOJA again. 
20719 4 Great product, Thanks. 
20720 4 Sorry for later writing the comments on it, this one is quite goods, it brings lot of fun in my life, I do see lots of nice birds. It s fantasic. 
20721 4 Works well. 
20722 1 we lost our camera LOL 
20723 0 Pin is too big on the door to use. Took to a camera store and they agreed... Can t use it. 
20724 4 This has worked fine for me for over 4? years. No problems... 
20725 4 love it 
20726 4 Heavy device. Needs a good tripod to use this device. Can carry bigger cam or photo camera 
20727 4 Great product! 
20728 0 Fitted nicely with my instax mini, but after using it for literally a few mintues the strap broke off. And the color is a lot darker than the picture. 
20729 4 Got it and setup was easy and it worked immediately. Seems to be a great product so far and I am looking forward to more usage. 
20730 2 As expected 
20731 4 Camera was awesome for a Caribbean cruise... Took great underwater pictures. 
20732 2 It performed as it was supposed to, but I returned because it covered too much of the LCD screen as well as the delete and review buttons on my D7100. Also, once on, difficult to remove! 
20733 4 It is awesome I would highly recommend this if your gonna shoot a lot of pictures. 
20734 1 There are many out there that look the same. This isn t the one that you want, can hardly hold a small phone.Waste of money. 
20735 1 It seems a little stiff, but soft. It smells HORRIBLE right out of the package though. I m just kinda disappointed, but if my opinion changes (when it smells better and loosens up) I ll change my review. 
20736 3 Pleasantly surprised. Easy to put on - no air bubbles. Works great and would recommend 
20737 4 one of the best camara protection I bought 
20738 4 Product was as advertised. 
20739 4 Them two extra batteries and 12V&110V charger is great thing to have they last 2x longer then OEM in my sony290 camera thanks for great deal 
20740 4 Great quality product with affordable price. Well worth the money. 
20741 2 Was pretty good. the seam on the handle broke the day I got it. Bummer 
20742 4 Excellent Camera!!! Highly recommend. Takes Beautiful Pics!!! 
20743 1 came scratched 
20744 1 Do not buy it! Damaged from my first use, very small and good for pocket, but since I used the coin to fix the camera, two of rubber pieces damaged.. 5 minutes only after unpacking! 
20745 4 Makes a world of difference on my D700. Manual focus is very sharp when using this eyepiece. I recommend it. 
20746 3 A perfect fit for my cannon camera and the 2 extra batteries is even made it better, didn t have to worry I was going to run out of batteries. 
20747 2 You get what you pay for. But OK. 
20748 3 Fits the camera it was recommended for fine. No issues. 
20749 4 I have used a Zomodo system which is really not good; I tried this WIFI NVR System without any high expectation,but so far it is good,outlooking, setting,APP,WIFI signal,service is also prompt.The problem is without ethernet cable which I think should be. 
20750 4 Great! 
20751 3 Great battery however, it would be smart to keep a few extra of these charged up in your bag. 
20752 3 good 
20753 4 Got it in a couple of days and works perfectly! 
20754 1 Don t buy it. It doesn t fit a Nikon as advertised. Spend the extra money and buy a good product. 
20755 4 Very sturdy construction 
20756 2 It s a lens hood. It does the job. While it s made for my lens, the fit feels off, 
20757 0 Died in no time, now I have to go thru hoops to get repaired, very dis-satisfied 
20758 4 Good purchase! Fast shipping! 
20759 4 Great product. 
20760 4 Totally loved this album! It s great quality and holds my pictures perfectly. 
20761 4 Better than I expected 
20762 4 I m happy to have a working camera again, thank you. 
20763 3 Works great for black and white film photography. 
20764 4 This is a present to the world. 
20765 4 great seller - delivered as promised! 
20766 4 Excellent lens. Very handy for street photography. I am keeping it all the time in my OM-D5 I hang around with this one, and my D7100 with the 18-200 on the other shoulder. Great combination. 
20767 4 I had low expectations based on the price, but the quality is quite good, provided the light is good. My only complaint is the Nikon style T-adapter cannot be protected by a Nikon end cap. It fits too loosely and falls off. 
20768 3 Only problem I have is remote. it shows low battery every time and does not working... 
20769 3 Works well once I got the proper macro lens. Product description is coy on that point. 
20770 4 Great pricing and just as I ordered. 
20771 4 Works great with GoPro Hero 4 silver 
20772 3 Use it as protection for my 70-200. Well worth price. 
20773 0 when an e mail is created to try to watch it outside the home, it doesn t let me. 
20774 4 Very sturdy tripod smart looking folds up tor easy carrying 
20775 0 Very handy item. I keep one in the glove box of both cars. I also would recommend the remote timer Hapurs Bluetooth to use with it. 
20776 4 Perfect for our T2i, and quickly shipped. 
20777 3 Works but not designed as good as chums brand version. 
20778 4 Great response from seller. One of the screen had a defect and was replaced quickly by seller. The screen saver works great and is holding up on the watch and minimize scratches on the glass. 
20779 4 Love it! Also have a wireless remote but I like this one better. 
20780 4 batteries perform at least as good as factory originals. No formal testing done though. 
20781 4 very sharp, great on street photography compact & light to carry around 
20782 3 Great bag! Lots of pockets! Wish it wasn t so bulky though! 
20783 4 nice gift 
20784 4 Wonderful product and so darn easy to use! I highly recommend. 
20785 3 light weight tripod stand. wish it was a little bigger. only like four feet high 
20786 4 WORKED AS PROMISED - THANK YOU! 
20787 4 This product totally served the need to which it was applied. We will continue to use the ZINK Photo Paper for our needs, as they occur. Thanks for such a reliable product. 
20788 4 Great 
20789 3 I am very happy with this purchase and it is really valuable addition to my gear. 
20790 4 I lost my Nikon D5300 Charger and I needed one—quick. With prime, shipping was speedy and painless, the company sent a friendly email and the product works most importantly. Much better than buying the $50 Nikon Product. Would recommend to anyone. 
20791 4 very good for the price--as described 
20792 4 I was looking for a case for my Nikon Coolpix S9700 and this one is a perfect fit. 
20793 3 The camera is performing nicely in my home. It sometimes loses its connectivity, but seems to reconnect over time. I held back on giving it 5 stars because of the price for a cloud account and no option to store video on customer hardware. 
20794 4 Very impressed with the USB charge system as compared to the direct charging system. Enjoy the use of product very much. Highly recommending the combination unit for purchase. 
20795 2 Lots of interference if you use as a baby moniter. We needed it for our mother who moved in. So it works ok as an intercom but it s cheaply made and we had to add 100 feet of extra wire. It s what we expected for the money. 
20796 3 Happy with merchandise 
20797 4 Great light ! 
20798 2 This filter paints a purpure sky while shooting on the film. 
20799 3 Great Camera but the GoPro Studio keeps on crashing on me. 
20800 4 works perfect with my video cameras... 
20801 4 Worked like a charm! 
20802 4 Great solid and sturdy lightstand for the price! I have a 4x6 softbox with constant light set up on it in my studio and have had no issues. 
20803 4 very good quality. Has 2 bubble levels to adjust the tripod. Fits my LG PA77U projector well. Good buy! 
20804 3 The product is as advertised, what more can you ask for. 
20805 4 This was one of my best decisions i have ever made. its so cute and the cheepest price on the market. works great and super duper cute! i think everyone should get one. quality is great and a nice fit in the hand. High remarks about this. 
20806 4 Hugely impressed by this product. Serves mainly as a secondary/slave. Excellent performance, nonetheless. 
20807 3 Love the camera, but would have liked the seller to advertise that camera does not have U.S. warranty. 
20808 4 nice! little heavy for dlite 4 
20809 4 Purchased this to cover my hot shoe on the [[ASIN:B00I8BICCG Sony Alpha a6000 Mirrorless Digital Camera - Body only]] I purchased. This is made by Sony as does a fantastic job at protecting the hot shoe since I shoot 100% without flash as a natural light shooter! 
20810 0 camera doesn t work right the picture keep rolling 
20811 0 Don t buy this product!. No connectivity, confirmed with a multimeter. Adds to frustration of getting a camera configured. 
20812 4 works great 
20813 4 My favorite camera... 
20814 4 Excellent product. Thank you!! 
20815 4 Very happy with purchase!!! 
20816 4 Excellent product as to price If you are entering astronomy, this is the right one! But it s extremely hard to colliminate 
20817 4 Thanks... Good product... Fast shipment... 
20818 2 The product is as described and would be fine. However, it does not appear to be very well made as one of the clips was broken on the honeycomb grid and also on one of the color filters. I guess you get what you pay for. 
20819 4 Purchased this to protect my lens and it works perfectly. 
20820 3 these were for my son; I haven t heard any complaints so he must be happy with them! 
20821 3 This camera works pretty good tested it at the pool also at the lake when about 5 feet under water no problem image its pretty good about same as my galaxy s2. 
20822 0 Did not work. Installed battery, LCD screen came on, then nothing would work, not even the light. Returned for refund. Refund was processed quickly and without question. Would purchase from Bopo again, just not from Dot Line Corp. 
20823 4 perfect fit for a Chrome Messenger and a LowePro Slingshot 202 
20824 3 As advertised fit and charges well 
20825 3 Great grip, very comfortable. Only problem I find is the bottom attachment is pretty bulky. Contrary to other posts, you CAN add a neck strap as I ve demonstrated in the photo. It comes with this metal bracket that is designed to add the neck strap to. 
20826 4 This head fits on my Sirui P-424 carbon monopod and can support the weight of my heaviest lens. 
20827 4 A bit pricey for what it is, but that s Canon s fault. Otherwise, it does what it was designed to do. 
20828 0 I found this camera hard to keep connected. Ended up returning. I ve owned 2 other Foscam camera s in the past, but this camera wasn t very reliable. One positive note: the setup was pretty easy. 
20829 3 Good value - picture. 
20830 3 Great Lens, high quality photos, contrasts and color! But taking video s with this lens on the Sony 6000 is very loud, you can hear the motor chattering when it s auto focusing. 
20831 4 easy tu use vert good 
20832 3 Fun, small camera and takes good pictures. 
20833 3 Love B+W I was highly dissapointed that after blowing these off, then wiping carefully with breadth/moisture and a clean microfiber cloth I still had micromarring on the surface. I feel like the glass/foil is incredibly soft in these. 
20834 4 Great for selfies. Easy to put on & take off. 
20835 4 Works perfectly. And I love being able to move it and see it from my cell phone. 
20836 4 Perfect! I charge my original gopro battery and my 2 smatree batteries at the same time! Gets the same battery life for a fraction of the price of original gopro batteries. 
20837 2 it is just ok, nothing special 
20838 4 Thank you 
20839 1 The item is bulky and cumbersome and did not perform to my liking. 
20840 3 Good 
20841 4 Works great 
20842 3 Great lens 
20843 4 Great product, clear, bright images. Definitely worth the price. The case looks pretty resistant to field work. 
20844 2 Enjoy this product, fun to use. 
20845 4 More than just a camera case - I would even use it as a purse. 
20846 4 This is a very nice lens, item was delivered ahead of schedule in a very secure packaging. Lens tested OK Looks good on my GX7 
20847 4 canon eos t3i works great. 
20848 4 Good price and fast shipping 
20849 3 Camera was good but the bag for camera was too small。。。 
20850 3 Great Product 
20851 2 fine 
20852 4 awesome protective case 
20853 4 I m very happy with the performance of these batteries. I bought two, one for each camera. I have a Gopro3 and 3+. 
20854 4 The right tool for the right job 
20855 4 Excellent product for the price, doing everything that I needed it to do. 
20856 4 Best you can get for the price 
20857 4 works great, price is great 
20858 3 Bought for fishing, fits great, the angle isn t great. When dehooking sharks, you see too much ground. Head mount is a better fit for that. 
20859 3 Pleased 
20860 3 was very useful and versatile.[[ASIN:B00PPXGY3O Black Pro Large Octopus Tripod with Adapter Holding 3 Kgs Size 250*60*60mm for Gopro Hero 4 3+ Camera Digital Slrs/dslr/dv]] 
20861 4 Definitely worth it for the money. No issues so far. Using with a Canon 70D. 
20862 4 It is very light weight and plenty sturdy enough for light weight light sources. For the price, it is very well made. 
20863 4 I really enjoy this item. The lighting it gives, out great for my photography. I own two of them. 
20864 3 Great product, exceeds requirements. 
20865 4 Great camera and great customer service from a guy named Kenneth. I was lost and he got me up and running in only a few minutes. 
20866 3 It s not as sturdy as I thought it would be but it s compact and easily fits in a backpack or even pockets. I would not recommend this for &#34;fablets&#34; like the iPhone 6 plus or Notes. 
20867 4 Excellent quality UV filter. I purchased this to go on a Sigma 150-600mm Contemporary lens, and I have not been disappointed. Thee are several less expensive filters out there, but this is worth the extra money. Jeff 
20868 4 gift for my son...he loved it 
20869 4 Works great. A very versatile charger. 
20870 4 This system was for a HS FFA program barn. Install was easy and setup was even easier. Been running for several weeks and it is going great. Can t say enough good about this system and the company that sold it. Great customer service. 
20871 4 Very nice 
20872 4 Very good 
20873 3 Very Good 
20874 4 Tudo ok! 
20875 4 Very nice unit with lots of thing you can do with it. Can t beat the price for such a versatile piece of equipment. Little bit bulky to carry with you. 
20876 4 Good product solves the purpose 
20877 4 Very Good 
20878 4 Great addition to the outside play area of the wife s dog business. Keeps the vandals out at night while providing great visibility to the people that have to do the late night potty break. Well constructed. Bright. Easy install. 
20879 4 work great nice videos, sound, pictures. it did`nt work at first but the memory card went in to far pull it out just a little and it worked fine after that. 
20880 4 Sturdy product and has worked for me on multiple snorkeling trips. 
20881 3 Bought it as a present for my grandma and she love s it. I doesn t have a great resolution but you can t ask more fore the price. Easy to use. 
20882 3 works well with Windows 8. auto crops the photo to perfect size. Instructions on the scanner tell you to insert every photo in the plastic-do so it is easy and gets you the best scan. Just be sure to keep scanning surface clean with tools provided. 
20883 4 Excellent 
20884 2 Battery was cheap. Doesn t hold a charge very long, but wasn t very expensive either. I guess you get what you pay for 
20885 4 These are GREAT. They were plug and play right away. The audio was clear and really worked very well with the filmed presentation. Very worth the investment. 
20886 3 Nice case. Durable. Shipped on time. 
20887 0 Non standard PoE and not advertised in the description of the product: it does not come with its own power supply and PoE injector and Samsung tries to sell its own solution with a recorder that costs a lot and has oownly 4 Ethernet imput adding 4 analog inputs 
20888 3 Got it super fast and I use it everyday. 
20889 2 good! 
20890 0 Very low build quality. Not ready for prime time. Pass on this one. I bought two and they are expensive non-functional paper weights. It s the ptz motor ... It slips when repisitioning rendering it useless. Tech support virtually a joke. 
20891 4 Having a blast with it 
20892 2 Works well but after about a year of use the legs have worn down and causes the monopod to rest on one leg instead of all three. 
20893 4 I m very happy! 
20894 4 Wonderful, I view anywhere and anytime, daytime color very nice , night time with night visions perfect. Easy setup, give me 5 to 10 minutes , I will buy one more set later. Good price Thanks Eyesun Technology Co 
20895 4 Love this bag, Love the colors and it carries nicely on my shoulder. Plus I can carry cross ways and very comfortable. 
20896 4 Great product! 
20897 4 Adorable 
20898 4 Works as described 
20899 4 Excellent value and works well on my Cannon Rebel T5. 
20900 4 Threat 
20901 0 Ordered this two pack as backups for Nikon 1 v1. Neither battery would take a charge they put the charger into an error state ... fast flashing led. Good thing I still have two batteries for the camera. 
20902 4 Thanks D link customer service rep #ER004228. I was in a jam and she went above and beyond in helping me out case#C6723426 
20903 2 Will return these also. Read that props break on occasion and the ad stated that these are also bought with the Parrot Spider, however these are not for the Parrot Spider, much larger. Maybe should have read closer. 
20904 4 Simply perfect, they do what you spect to do 
20905 1 This that is so big !!!! Way big for my Pentax k50. If you what big it was made well. 
20906 4 Beautifully crafted and well designed case. Offers a reasonable amount of protection with decent access to the battery and memory as well as controls. A bit expensive but high quality. 
20907 4 Very good and sturdy. 
20908 4 Great charger. Much better than the stock nikon charger. 
20909 4 Yes 
20910 4 Great little camera.I would recommend this to EVERYONE! 
20911 4 Very impressive for a good price. 
20912 3 Looks to be a good buy for the price. Still learning how to use the camera, but am sure I will enjoy using it with the tripod. 
20913 4 This background paper is just what I needed. Received it quickly. Would recommend to others. 
20914 4 Glad we bought this for our screen 
20915 4 Greatly 
20916 4 Exactly what I was looking for 
20917 2 Product as described, fast shipping, a bit disappointed by the packaging which was minimally protective with respect to the expense and vulnerability of the product. Hoping the lens continues to function as intended. 
20918 4 The Camera is modelF19821W. I was assisted today by Walter. Walter was extremely helpful. 
20919 4 I would buy again. 
20920 4 Works great! Way cheaper than the Sony and has the wireless shutter release and intervalometer. The instructions on how to use the remote are terrible but if you keep at it, it can be figured out! 
20921 4 Fits perfect. For those moments when you dont need the original housing. I use it for most of the time for biking & surrounding sounds. Very happy with it. 
20922 4 Just what I needed. Thanks 
20923 3 Great case, smaller than appeared. But the quality is good and it does the job well. 
20924 0 The film was expired and produced black film. I would not purchase this again. 
20925 4 I was very happy with this iem 
20926 4 I wish this was the stock case that came with the action cams but very pleased with it. 
20927 0 It doesn t work and I cannot get any help from the vendor. It has potential, but there is no contact for help. 
20928 3 just what i expected 
20929 4 Love this , will be buying a couple more 
20930 0 This is a good bag but it does not fit a Nikon D330 and lens as described. 
20931 4 It works. 
20932 4 as described and match my camera perfectly 
20933 4 The picture are very sharp, Camera is made sturdily plus underwater photos are excellent 
20934 4 Package came perfect and fast. Still have to test product though. 
20935 4 Great convenient protection. 
20936 4 I have Qflash T4d and I was not sure if this diffuser is going to fit. It fits well, and I am very satisfied. 
20937 4 Much more convenient than my camera strap. It is comfortable and functional. Don t hesitate. 
20938 4 rock solid, ingenious design... total quality 
20939 1 Very difficult to use 
20940 4 simple, and practice! The pictures show better look after use this flash 
20941 3 Good product for my needs. Some lag in camera rotation, but still very useful for checking the house and pets when away. Very much like the night vision function. 
20942 4 Excellent! 
20943 0 Would not transfer data. 
20944 4 Product was as advertised. 
20945 4 I love this camera. Takes great crisp, clear pictures. This is absolutely worth it! Everything shown in the picture was with the bundle. 
20946 4 like it 
20947 0 cute, but not functional. No memory card included 
20948 1 Good camera, but not very practical and too heavy for me. I thought it was lighter to carry around. I wonder if I could exchange it. 
20949 4 good! 
20950 1 I don t use it because it is oddly shaped and I can t really fit anything in it. 
20951 4 Easy for setup and not expensive I like it 
20952 0 Received an envelope with no 0 screen protector. 
20953 4 I had lost my original cable and have still not found it. This one is an exact replacement. 
20954 4 finally can use my land camera with out modifying it, will buy again. 
20955 4 All ok 
20956 2 The head is not that smooth and the legs are not connected together. It is a sturdy stand for static shots but not for action or sports. 
20957 3 Good but the 910 turns out to be a little smaller than what I needed. Kept it anyway. 
20958 0 It is what it is 
20959 4 Awesome little camera. For hundreds less than the GP it s hard to beat! 
20960 4 Despite the fact I took me a while to figure out how to install the lens hood (operator error), the product itself is great. It does what it s suppose to do for a great price. 
20961 0 The digital picture frame will not turn me get damaged 
20962 4 Sturdy and compact with all the essential features. 
20963 4 GREAT 
20964 4 These were just the ticket for replacing a scratched lens. Fit well, and were easy to install. 
20965 0 It s description of the cord it will not work for ps3 or Xbox 
20966 3 Nice gels, but took a long time to get here (Chicago area). 
20967 1 Really nice but really hard to fly. 
20968 4 If you have a Gopro hero camera and don t have a case, this is well worth the money. 
20969 4 Perfect data transfer! Fair price. 
20970 4 Very cool to wear and awesome POV shots 
20971 4 Henry was the best 
20972 4 I am very pleased with the slide viewer and it came in very soon after it was ordered. 
20973 4 The best in price and quality. 
20974 4 Good..... 
20975 4 Great portable light modifier. Built well enough. Works as I expected. Great item. 
20976 0 sometimes working sometimes don t 
20977 3 I thought you could take pictures w/o removing it from case. Nope. But it will definitely protect the camera!!! 
20978 2 First time using it and the strap fell off, thankfully I didn t lose my go-pro. 
20979 4 Great. 
20980 4 What I really like about this backdrop is how flat it stores. Bigger than I expected tall/wide (a good thing i guess for backdrops) Those black things are heavy weights that work well. It comes ready to go, pretty simple to use. (I m a guy who never reads directions) 
20981 3 I haven t had the camera long but it has met all my expectations and then some. I am especially thrilled to have the 55-200mm lens which allows me to take up close photos of nature. I am very happy so far with the camera. 
20982 4 no surprise 
20983 4 Christmas gift, my wife loved it. 
20984 4 I love my camera. I need to learn more about it 
20985 4 Have had it for a month or so. Received it fast. Loaded all sorts of pictures (around 2000 portrait and landscape oriented pictures) in the supplied USB flash drive. No issues. Works great, picture is great, motion sensor is great.. No complaints. 
20986 4 Excellent binocs. Shipping speed was good. 
20987 4 Love this selfie stick I wasn t a big fan of it but now I can take family pics all by myself it s nice and small fits anywhere n very cute 
20988 3 Happy with this buy 
20989 3 Great camera, easy to use and set up. I linked it to my home wifi and can email the pictures directly to myself from the camera super easy! Takes great pictures 
20990 0 First time using these, the Phantom 3 was extremely unstable. Even after calibration before the flight, the drone was out of control, and crash into my car. Sent an email to DJI, but they did not respond. Beware before you try these. 
20991 4 excellent!!! 
20992 3 good, shipping fast 
20993 2 Happy with the camera. For a used camera it easy replaces the one that I lost.. Working condition, etc. perfect. Thank you 
20994 4 This was bought for my daughters birthday. We found the GoPro Hero 3 to be everything the write up said it would do. The package came packed secure and in a timely manner. Not only did it work great at the pool party but survived a group of amateur photographers. 
20995 4 Great camera, but the accessories tossed in are mediocre at best. The Flash is crap and the tripod is flimsy, I sure wouldn t trust it for my new Nikon that for sure. Still, not a bad deal when I bought it a few months ago. 
20996 4 great way to carry around some extra memory caards 
20997 2 Pretty average camera, but it works 
20998 4 One of the best for all those looking for a case for their heady glass or anything really. It has the pick and pluck float so you can fit litterally anything that can fit in the box 10/10 
20999 4 All the accessories are great! Love them all! So glad I got it! The monopod is the best feature by far! 
21000 1 Although the item seems to &#34;work&#34;, it has very poor sensitivity. It can alarm of movement if the moving person or object is within about 15 feet or less of the detector. It of limited use for most applications or driveways. 
21001 0 Poor fit in the D750. A bit too large and could not clear space below protector at two corners. Should be a bit smaller, the Vello was much better. 
21002 4 Works as it should. Nice strong clasp, doesn t fall off 
21003 2 Wasn t as expected.. very disapointed. Couldn t read the instructions because they weren t in English to figure out how to work it. Didn t come with any film either... bummer. 
21004 4 Work perfectly fine with my 1D MKIII. No issues. 
21005 3 Good product, quality and appearance 
21006 4 Freaking Fantastic! 
21007 4 Have been using this for a while and have had no issues. No bubbles...Great protection. 
21008 2 How do you possibly make sense of all this neewer stuff. You buy the bulb but didn t get the light. you didn t get the diffuser. the diffuser comes in 4 colors. why? 
21009 4 So happy with it. It s perfect 
21010 4 Good 
21011 4 Product is self explainable. Just make sure you measure before ordering this way you don t have to roll up 30 feet of wire. 
21012 4 Good Quality product! Heavy duty, easy to use, sturdy. I m extremely HAPPY with my purchase!~DUG 
21013 4 Excellent value. Works great with my Nikon P610. Light and sturdy. Very compact. 
21014 0 Tippy and very cheaply made 
21015 0 did not work at all - 
21016 0 The straps ripped almost immediately. 
21017 4 I ve had other lens adapters, and they were awkward fitting and using. Not the case with this. I bought it to use my Minolta lenses on my Sony A3000. It goes on easily, and swapping lenses is fast and easy as well. It s a joy to use! 
21018 4 beautiful picture quality. Takes stunning macro images and can be used as a telescoping lens in a pinch. Highly recommended for any serious or armature photographer. I m rather armature but have included an example pic of one my dart frogs. 
21019 2 The sleeves work, but I would like it if they fit the film a little bit more snugly. 
21020 4 Perfect ... as it supposed to be !! 
21021 4 good start. good price with lots of accessories. light weight, easy to take. 
21022 4 came on time was what I expected 
21023 4 I bought this thinking my used camera would be sent with out a battery. But always can use fresh ones. 
21024 4 Fit my alarm system, came in a plain box. Could careless about the box, batteries work and family is once again protected. 
21025 4 excelente 
21026 4 For holding it does good for when doing a lot of shots. Does not feel safe for walking around. 
21027 4 Bulky but offers a nice blast of air - better than those little grey blowers. 
21028 0 Although the battery is listed as a replacement for the Panasonic original it the camera rejected it since it was not an original Panasonic product. Check out the web for the exact issue. Do not buy this battery! It fits but does not function. 
21029 0 Did not fit.. 
21030 4 Unobtrusive and effective. They break now and then, but for the price and simplicity you can replace it and go on your way. [[ASIN:B00IP22A08 5pcs Anti-lost Lens Cover Cap Keeper Lanyard Keeper Holder Strap Rope for Sony Olympus Canon Nikon Dslr SLR Camera]] 
21031 0 Don t. Buy this it s a. Lie I looked and. It said it was compatible with my camera. And it didn t fit. It s like I threw. A few. Dollars. Down the street 
21032 4 Came in less than a week! The rig is about what you d expect for the price. Nice and basic! 
21033 0 The slide scans are way off color. Kodachrome negatives cannot be scanned to make a useful digital negative or positive. 
21034 4 Good 
21035 4 The size and weight all work well with my Rebel T51. Since purchasing and using it has added another dimension of quality to my photos. A must have. 
21036 2 It is a bit flimsy but does the job. What I expected from Polaroid. =) 
21037 3 The arm is solid. The tripod that s inside the handle...come gopro you could ve done better. Very flimsy plastic! 
21038 0 GoPro does not support warrentees if you buy from Amazon. Don t do it. 
21039 4 good product 
21040 4 Fits perfect.....great price. 
21041 4 I have owned this for 2 years and it is still in great condition. Depending on what you re doing you may want a higher quality/more versatile tripod. This one is great for an ameture photographer. 
21042 4 Great lens, very sharp and great focus. Great deal, especially for the price. 
21043 4 Still love the D5200... even since I left it on a train in Berlin within a month of purchase! Let me know if you re the one who found it :•( 
21044 4 I love that the power if built into the cat5 cable! I bough extra cable, however it wasn t needed. this kit had what I needed. The app is fairly solid! 
21045 3 This is an excellent value for a water white filter. I haven t experienced any issues with flare, and its color reproduction is far better than you d normally get for the price. 
21046 4 Oh, very good camera, feels like built with good materials. Small size, quick & clear focusing, photos better than my other digital camera. Love it. 
21047 4 Work out well 
21048 4 Loved it. Easy to learn and use especially if you are just learning how to work it. It is also good for beginners such as myself. 
21049 0 Wouldn t hold a charge and cost as much to return as paid for. 
21050 4 No issues here. 
21051 4 This GoPro handle really makes it much easier to get different angles and shoot more interesting clips. It floats so enables you to take underwater video without someone holding the camera. The strap helps a lot to allow movement without losing the GoPro if you are in the ocean. 
21052 0 The package was opened when it arrived and the screws were not the right size at all! 
21053 0 Sucks!! no way to secure to rail!!!!! 
21054 4 Great Items 
21055 3 It works as it should, despite being flimsier than more expensive brands. It does it s job. 
21056 0 lens fell out on first use, and casing became chipped immediately. Very poor quality item. No response from seller beyond requesting photos, which I provided repeatedly. Very disappointed. 
21057 4 excellent 
21058 4 YOU JUST CAN T BEAT THE PRICE AND HOLD S A CHARGE...HAPPY WITH PURCHASE.. 
21059 4 Product arrived on time and was exactly as described. Have only used them around neighborhood but have worked perfectly. Will be using them in the field in 2 weeks 
21060 0 This battery was about 1/16 inch shorter than the original 504 is was to replace. Waste of money. 
21061 4 i love it...as expected 
21062 4 Product was exactly as described and at a great price and very fast delivery !!! Will be back to this sellers page !!! 
21063 3 Worked exactly as described, and easier to use than expected. 
21064 4 These 1600 mah batteries last longer per use than Kodak s KLIC-7004 at 1000 mah Charger works well. Have used these batteries for about month. 1/17 Batteries continue to work well. Have gone over to Kodak charger. 
21065 0 Fat chance getting license plates or facial features. Too blurry.... 
21066 3 Works keeps it aflote 
21067 4 just sold this housing to a friend and upgraded to the same one but for the canon d5 mark iii, i love ikelite and they make a great product. amazing lighting products as well. well worth the investment1 
21068 4 small, durable, gets the job done. Highly recommended 
21069 2 Sometimes it is difficult to get the camera leveled, but in general it is a good product. 
21070 3 Arrived in great condition. 
21071 4 Good batteries, great value. Highly recommended. 
21072 4 Fast service and a true fit. Service is the key they have the products and system down pat..... 
21073 4 Well made and worth the money..... 
21074 4 Got a clean sensor on my Canon 30D now. 
21075 3 Wish the price for storage was 1/2 of what s being charged. Too rich for my blood. 
21076 4 Easy to install, work great. One had issues and replacement was very easy. 
21077 4 Excellent 
21078 4 Love this Lens. Color came out to be very good. 
21079 4 Works great 
21080 4 Fits great and works amazing. Sure, if you have time to set up there are light modifiers that will do a better a job but if you are shooting an event where things change too fast to allow for set up this does the trick nicely. 
21081 4 OK 
21082 4 purchase 2 of these for other deputies. I finally got one for my self I recommend it to all LEO s works great. 
21083 0 Unit worked once then quit working. New egg and manufacturer FAILED TO refund or replace defective product after many requests. New egg passed responsibility to CHINA company who has not refunded for product. RIP OFFS 
21084 3 I am using this case to hold my Pentax K-50 DSLR camera and it keeps the camera well protected; the small additional compartments can hold other accessories like batteries and battery charger and memory cards, etc. 
21085 0 Don t waste your money, time and frustration level. It s not worth it! 
21086 3 Works! 
21087 4 thanks 
21088 0 Complete junk 
21089 2 Its a cool little extra to have around but I wish it wasn t plastic, 
21090 0 Remote does not work for my Canon 60d 
21091 4 Very nice backdrop. 
21092 4 Perfect! Love it! 
21093 0 Strap won t fit through the loop on my Panasonic Lumix GF-3. Too wide. No instructions. Had to go to Youtube to see how to put it together. 
21094 4 works great 
21095 4 Exactly what I needed and workes great! 
21096 4 Nice 
21097 4 This little device is great. Works extremely well, and with the addition of the bush cover makes my confidence in the cleanliness of ly lens cleaning. 
21098 4 This works perfectly and better than expected. It gives me peace of mind! 
21099 4 Fit perfect lasts a lot longer than the factory battery. 
21100 4 Have not been able to use it yet, husband said it looks good 
21101 4 good 
21102 2 Okay 
21103 4 Excellent!....Just what I wanted! 
21104 4 Met my expectations and then some. I recommend. 
21105 0 i am having trouble setting them up they shut my internet down when i try to connect them i have conntacted seller and they will not contact me back 
21106 4 A very nice battery for my Panasonic Lumix FZ70. 
21107 4 Works well at cleaning the smudges off my glasses. Great value for a family like mine with many glasses in the house. 
21108 4 Really nice. Downloaded the instruction book on my tablet. Better than booklet. Not heavy either even with batteries. Love the color. 
21109 4 Easy to use and the instruction are easy. They are written in a conversational way that is easy to understand. 
21110 4 Perfect! I also bought the wrist strap so that I could swap according to the activity I am photographing. 
21111 4 works as it should. 
21112 0 Not at all what I wanted. Ordered wireless!! 
21113 4 Awesome value and works great. No issues so far. 
21114 4 very good 
21115 4 good lens cap bundle from CamKix. 
21116 4 It is great for all day shooting and is extremely easy, comfortable and convenient. 
21117 4 Great lens, great seller! 
21118 3 Good 
21119 4 Great lens for the price and it suited my needs using my Canon 70D and my 50D 
21120 4 This was a great deal on two batteries, charger and 220v adapter. I had to go elsewhere to get the Camera (Nikon 610), it was $100 cheaper at 42 street photo. 
21121 4 Works as represented 
21122 3 Binoculars are great. Able to focus quite close and far distant with clarity. Binoculars would get a 5-star from me except for lens caps that too easily come off. 
21123 4 This lens has made a sigma fan out of me. I had an older model of this on a Canon, was good but not great. This new model is much sharper, it stays on the Pentax body now. 
21124 1 It is to dark, and the night vision is useless!! 
21125 0 im not sure how long these worked for but very unpredictable. 
21126 4 Great fit and very easy to put on. 
21127 3 Little expensive 
21128 2 Its OK. Works. 
21129 4 great little camera!!!! i d buy it again. 
21130 0 Terrible quality 
21131 1 Sent it back. Not exactly what I was looking for 
21132 4 Works great. 
21133 4 Woah, this thing is awesome! It could light an entire room with it being the only light source. However it does come with a dimmer so you are not sliding all your subjects. 
21134 0 What app do I download 
21135 4 Just exactly what was needed. 
21136 0 I expected these to fit the op/tech camera harness. They did not mate 
21137 4 Fantastic camera and I will learn more as I go,, still reading and playing around with it 
21138 3 Item as described works with nikon d5500 
21139 4 Arrived as ordered, works fine. I ve been using SterlinkTek for years - great products at great prices 
21140 0 There is no way to attach the gopro to the chest strap. I think you will need to have a case that houses the gopro and snaps into the chest start. I wish the description stated that. 
21141 4 Exactly as expected. 
21142 4 Exactly what I expected. It charges superfast and lasts long. 
21143 1 Having a case that separated into two pieces and you have to take one off (and hold it) every time you want to take a photo is really annoying. 
21144 0 Not for iPhone 6+ 
21145 4 As described, works great. 
21146 4 Fun camera, worked under water in Hawaii with great video and pictures. 
21147 3 IS A GOOD CASE 
21148 4 This product exceeded my expectations. I m going to test it underwater this weekend during my dive 
21149 4 Great product for the price. I would recommend this polarizer anytime. 
21150 4 Caught my crazy neighbor and daughter keying my wife s car. Happen at 3:00 am night vision was crystal clear. 
21151 4 it s alright 
21152 4 It s okay, but not what I expected 
21153 0 Goes off line a lot and you cannot access camera from WiFi locations...I m very disappointed with this product. 
21154 4 Love it so much! 
21155 0 Didn t work, turned on then off. Instructions were terrible not very helpful at all 
21156 4 I m glad I bought this instead of the Canon brand! The price is excellent and it fits really well. Highly recommended for canon 70-200mm F4 IS. 
21157 3 This was a replacement for the identical camera that somehow quit working properly...........we chose to replace with the warrantee rather than repair for $125. 
21158 4 important warranty plan if you re a vlogger who might be prone to breaking things! 
21159 4 Oh so wonderful and functional... I love all the compartments! I ve used it for two weddings so far... It s great for carrying an extra lens or two. 
21160 3 The GPS seems to work reasonably well. Photos have come out quite nicely. Easy to use. Have yet to figure out how to sync with my iPhone which is why I ve not given 5-stars. Have tried on several occasions but haven t hit upon the correct sequence yet. 
21161 2 They called large but its not that large, i have to leave out some of my equipment. at least is well made. wished was a little cheaper because is a amazon basics product. 
21162 2 This camera is very average, if you wanting to buy this for less money buy the Vivotek version rather than the Cisco one. 
21163 2 I wanted the protection that the case offer, and for the most part I am satisfied with it, but it makes it difficult to get the memory card out of the camera and does not offer as much coverage on the sides of the camera as I had hoped. 
21164 4 product was as described, great quality 
21165 2 Really expensive for what it is. 
21166 2 great quality but expensive 
21167 3 it was very usefull and handy 
21168 4 Quick delivery and fit my camera perfectly! I always lose these so I m sure I ll be ordering more soon! 
21169 4 Love it. Easy set up. Great quality. 
21170 3 very good product. excellent quality 
21171 3 works great, just missed the fact that a spare battery wasn t included. 
21172 2 It works pretty well but some of the hardware is not the greatest I had a substitute a different stand bracket for the one that came with the clamp 
21173 4 Works perfectly, better then I had anticipated 
21174 4 I bought this for my husband and he was delighted! 
21175 4 It fits well and stays on the Sony Nex 7. 
21176 3 Was pleasantly surprised. Used on vacation. No problems yet. 
21177 4 Fast delivery and wonderful inexpensive product! 
21178 1 Only one of the batteries worked. The other didn t fit the charger 
21179 4 Outstanding Item and fast shipping. 
21180 0 don t work 
21181 0 The product fits too loosely. Lens does not click into adapter and adapter doesn t click to camera body. Slight wobble is enough to throw picture quality off. 
21182 4 Really great accessory to have when biking or attaching my GoPro to my motorcycle helmet, the laws of physics and mother nature may come into play. 
21183 0 It would have been very cute, however, it never actually arrived. 
21184 4 best price 
21185 2 handle broke within the first week 
21186 4 Great item for the price, can t wait to use it! 
21187 1 Not including the holder 
21188 4 Carl was a great help to me as I was setting up my camera. The camera does exactly as expected. Perfect for what I needed and with a little help setting it up, it was a breeze. 
21189 4 Excellents 
21190 4 Bought the imposter, now I ve got factory battery! 
21191 4 Quality Product. Looks Kool. 
21192 4 So far the camera is great, The only problem I have found is the the on/off button is easy to push while tring to zoom in or out. Just something I will have to get use to. But love everything else about the camera. 
21193 0 needs 120V power not battery operated 
21194 0 I, unfortunately, had a bad experience with this item: 1) Installed software update 2) Shut down the camera 3) Camera started to over heat 4) Opened the case to access the camera and removed the battery 5) Noticed that the top right corner had cracked 
21195 4 Good value. 
21196 4 Highly Recommended! 
21197 4 High quality strap. Too bad Carry Speed products are not sold in the USA. 
21198 4 Great deal, easy to use. Product does the job! 
21199 4 Great deal worth fast shipping. Good company to deal with. Very happy. 
21200 4 Just the right size for my Fujinon XF 55-200mm lens. 
21201 1 Did not fit to my Sony cam 
21202 4 This baby is definitely going to be my go-to handle for the GoPro (especially as more and more places are banning selfie sticks). Love this baby, feels good, floats, and allows me to get the videos I want. 
21203 4 Great little camera, really like the inline, not offset, lens. Very rugged has now hit the ground in a couple hard crashes while on my 250 FPV quadcopter. A couple dents i the case but, still working! For the money very hard to beat. 
21204 4 Dany did an outstanding job being patient with me. The camara is very good. 
21205 3 The cameras are very easy to install. I found that they required about a day to get solid signals and work out the bugs but after that they work flawlessly inside and out. I do wish they had audio because everything else works so well... 
21206 1 one of the clips fails and for that the right strap of the bag pack works improperly. The product feels cheap. 
21207 0 The earphone jack is not a tight fit for the gateway S5. I could only get it to work if I held the earphone jack connection in and then what s the point of the stick. 
21208 0 Contacted them - no reply.. Doesn t work & it is faulty. 
21209 0 Has a limited range and it did not work with my wireless network. 
21210 3 great shipper and quality 
21211 4 This pod has worked great so far. It has always kept its shape and is very flexible. The level on top is a great addition and I like the quick release mount for the gopro, or other camera. It does seem a little bulky though. 
21212 4 Great camera 
21213 4 I love this camera; so easy, great pictures and great price!!! Thanks!!! 
21214 4 This bag is well built and well padded. I could pack D 9 attached with Tokina 11- 17 mm lens, 1 nikon 18- 105 mm , 1 sigma 18- 250 mm macro hsn, and 1 nikon prime lenses. Looks small but with enough room 
21215 4 Cannot beat the price! Works great. I use three of these for wedding photography 
21216 3 Not quite so sturdy as expected. No instructions on how to convert to monopod, but after a while figured it out. Well made with minimum plastic parts. 
21217 4 Great value and great performing product. 
21218 4 sturdy but a little heavy 
21219 4 Vincent was the most intelligent, helpful Tech I ve worked with at Foscam. He quickly solved all issues and even suggested and helped me set remote settings, which nobody ever offered to help with before. He s really great! Thanks! 
21220 1 Image is ok Smartphone works ok Cannot upgrade firmware Image don t show at PC software 
21221 3 Great deal and it works great. Its so nice to not have to rely on one GoPro battery 
21222 4 Great 
21223 4 Great 
21224 3 I really liked the binoculars. It was a little tough getting them to adjust. Great buy, though. 
21225 4 Nice travel tripod for the price. Easy to setup, already took sample pictures and movies. Looking forward to Hawaii in less than three weeks. Mahalo! 
21226 4 Works perfectly and a fraction of the price Canon charges. 
21227 3 Great lense, fast shipping and love the accessories, except the bag is so small and useless! I can only fit my camera body in it. It looks totally different from the picture 
21228 4 Love the items. They work wonderful and fit great. Use on our trip to Ireland and was thrilled with all of them. Would order again in a second. Thanks for a great product! 
21229 4 Bigger than expected holds up great 
21230 4 Great group of accessories if you have a gopro 
21231 1 Just ordered and can t use it till I update it on my computer. Such a pain after getting the app and registering my son can t even fly it. 
21232 4 What can I say, It is a plug, it fit my battery charger. What else can I say about a power cord. 
21233 4 Present for sson He really likes it. 
21234 3 Works very well 
21235 4 That coil is a nice i almost make 15 tattoo and my liner machine run good no heat. 
21236 3 it is good. 
21237 3 The camera works fine, but the barrel of one of them will not unscrew, so the memory cannot be added. The replacement and three others work fine. 
21238 3 Mounted to an older Nikon 300/f2.8 so it can be quickly mounted to an Arca style QR. The anti-rotation flange is ideal for preventing possible movement of the shoe. 
21239 2 Not super high quality. I got it for watching netflix in bed - so I can lay on my side and put the screen at about a 45-degree angle to match my eyes. It tips over even with an iPhone 5 at that angle. 
21240 1 Female screw at the end has no thread..... What the.... I had to use my original screws from other adapter to hold the camera onto this grip. 
21241 4 very good , solid thumbscrew better than the plastic 
21242 4 Great value for the money and super quick shipment. Buy with confidence! 
21243 2 Great camera but not upgradeable to this day and age, to slow must be an old model. 
21244 1 Quality looking blades, but dangerous! These things are very stiff and could take your fingers off no problem! After a tip-over one blade embedded itself in the arm of my quad. And the lifting ability is much less than my original blades. 
21245 4 :) 
21246 4 I flew to NYC to photograph a wedding. These got the job done well and worked as carry-on luggage. Very light and easy to carry. 
21247 0 Very economical camera for the price. But not happy that the waterproof case was scratched up. Not able to have a clear video due to the scratches. Need to sell this accessory separately. 
21248 4 High quality and good to have extras. 
21249 0 Out of the package it didn t work 😠 
21250 0 Utterly underwhelmed. For the price, this camera is uninspired and heavily sand-bagged. Switching to A7Rii 
21251 1 Lint magnet! 
21252 4 Nice , cheap backup camera... 
21253 4 LOOVEEE IT so much! 
21254 4 Great replacements for the original! 
21255 4 Great! Works perfectly 
21256 4 Works great...;love it 
21257 3 so far so good 
21258 4 great 
21259 2 no good, go for phottix pls 
21260 2 For a starter its a good product and yes the stand is shaky as written by others. Overall its a good product in such a price 
21261 4 it fits good 
21262 2 Ok so i bought these because sony charges too much. The batteries work fine for average use. However if you need a battery to last as long as the sony one that the camera came with, I would not buy these. Just pay the extra money. 
21263 4 excellent telephone service from Walter relatively short wait time - wait time has been better in the past 
21264 3 Delivered on time and what a great product. All metal light weight body but heavy duty enough to handle the big jobs. It could have been a little taller but hence the 4 stars. 
21265 4 Works great thank you 
21266 4 Awesome unit. Great value. Works perfectly as described. Very handy on shoots! 
21267 4 Henry from customer service was incredible. He resolved my issues with my cameras both at my site and my remote site. Very satisfied with my cameras and Foscam 
21268 4 Great product easy to use, works as designed. 
21269 3 glad to find film for a special project 
21270 3 Great Value! 
21271 4 I love this camera and would not change it for the world. The customer service provided to me by Walter was professional and unrushed. It was perfect service and support. 
21272 4 Yhe dogs aren t happy. 
21273 4 I am an amateur, but I love photography. I now have a lens that gives me the ability to get great Micro shots. I love it, and I got it in 2 days. Bonus!! 
21274 4 Don t think, just buy. This camera is good enough to pay itself off with the freelance work it can create. 
21275 4 works great! used it on hard hats and sports caps, not too irritating on the head as well. 
21276 4 I use these batteries almost everyday. The original set I purchased is still going strong after 2years of continuous use. Added another camera to the setup and came right back to the same spot for batteries. Couldn t be happier. 
21277 3 functions as described. Additional memory is helpful for larger application. Requires some circuit reconfiguration to accommodate the lower board voltage. 
21278 4 It works fine. but the button is not soft like the camera of course. 
21279 4 best for prise!!! 
21280 4 thank you 
21281 4 cheap and effective 
21282 3 Nice, for light (not heavy) work. A little weak in the construction area...but for the price, an OK value. Easy to use and LOVE the portability. 
21283 2 I use these with my Smart Things system and it works pretty good. I ve noticed it misses quite a few motions. I m not super confident it is ability to pick up motion at the first past but eventually it sounds after a number of passes... 
21284 2 complicated as hell, instructions in googled english from chinese 
21285 0 the class was loose in the ring... rattled something horrible 
21286 4 Easy to setup, phone/pc controllable camera, works as expected 
21287 4 Great service. Great product 
21288 3 rec d as promised and as advertised 
21289 4 I still don t understand my first DSLR, but I ve already made magic with it. I m use to point and shoot cameras and almost DSLRs. I can t wait to learn how to use it properly, but once I learned to focus it, worked like clockwork. 
21290 2 I like it, but I hardly use this. it is too bulky to use as a transportable piece. It would be nice if I was stationary and left it up. But if that happened I would just build a wall. 
21291 4 I love the color, and the pictures are great! The product arrived quickly and just as stated. I am very happy with my purchase. 
21292 4 Good deal!!!! 
21293 4 What is not to love about instant photographs. All of the kids in 5th grade LOVE my &#34;old fashioned&#34; camera! 
21294 3 Only one worked ... Oh Well ... both took the charge but camera will not identify one of the batteries. Not the sellers fault. This has happen before so I chalk it up to the camera manuf. being propietary 
21295 4 Love this product. I have one in my car for my electronics and one in my house. Glad I have this as a safe way to clean my glasses, phone, and tablet. 
21296 4 Nice case. Phantom 3 and lots of extras fit perfectly. 
21297 4 Arrived on time with all accessories...everything just as promised. What an amazing drone, this technology has reached a remarkable price point for the capability and this seller will deliver. 
21298 0 I don t get the positive reviews. These are garbage. They last one week tops in a bark collar. 
21299 3 Very tough case. Traveled to Maui with no issues. Some of the comments said, that it comes with flash drives, but thats all lies. Its ONLY the case. 
21300 1 Didn t trust it to hold my expensive dslr, I ended up putting it on a smaller mirrorless instead. Even on this camera it cuts off circulation and is too tight. 
21301 4 Easy on screen protection 
21302 0 It broke at the foot right upon opening of package. And I m afraid to open the second package. :( What a disappointment. 
21303 4 Easy to install and configure the system. Worth the money. 
21304 3 Really helped alot 
21305 4 It works great and i love how the price was low but good dvr 
21306 4 excelente 
21307 4 Great Price, Fast Shipping 
21308 3 This Nikon lense does an outstanding job of capturing those long and difficult shots! 
21309 4 nice adapter and easy to set up 
21310 4 Fulfilling all expectations, very happy with the choice. 
21311 4 Got this for my daughter who loves it. Perfect for her Fugi film Instax photos. 
21312 2 Lights get dangerously hot way too fast. 
21313 4 Works really well. Accurately charges and doesn t overcharge. I don t have many charging at the same time, but it seems to work brilliantly 
21314 4 High quality good fit fair price good delivery 
21315 2 Hello, my only complaint has been that the dvr has stopped working after 7 months. Cannot find out if there is a warranty. 
21316 2 I used it during couple of my treks, outdoor shoots etc and its a great tool to protect your camera from rain, dust and snow. After some heavy use, some of the joints tore off. But its still usable. 
21317 4 Great alternative for the Nikon EN-EL4A that costs a lot more. The charge holds well over multiple cycles, which is a concern with aftermarket batteries. The full coding is good for battery metering. 
21318 4 works in my Lumix. Hope it lasts as long as the Panasonics. Seems to have high rating among many users. Sweet. 
21319 4 Just like a OEM charger. At a good price. And it charges quick. 
21320 4 The handle is light and really well made. The strap has a nice buckle which allows you to cinch the strap to minimize the chance of it coming off. Overall great quality and I highly recommend. 
21321 4 This pack has everything you d need at a really great price. Wish the case was a little bigger to hold everything it comes with but all in all a great package 
21322 2 Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles. 
21323 4 Great 
21324 1 it broke when tightened. 
21325 2 Great camera in good lighting, not so good at night. Over all not bad for the price. 
21326 4 very clear & great 
21327 0 This needs to 0 stars. This cable did not work at all. I have been busy and I need to find out how to return it. It was supposed to fit this camera. 
21328 0 Camera and accessories are great. But I m still waiting for the original Nikon camera manual. I won t buy from Al s in the future. 
21329 4 love it! 
21330 4 love the remote 
21331 0 This clearly states it s a 2 pack and we only received one! 
21332 4 Works great!!! This selfie stick is so easy to use. It works great with my iPhone 5 and it holds the phone tightly in place. It is made of good material and looks durable. Love using this selfie stick with family and friends. 
21333 4 Works like a charm and fits my battery. Exactly what I ordered. 
21334 4 A+ 
21335 4 Awesome, awesome, awesome my daughter loves it n takes everywhere, get the back door before going to the beach with it, better safe then sorry 
21336 0 very disappointed camera not showing cheaper cameras a showing better and as a professional installer i was very shocked not 850 TVL very blurry 
21337 2 The camera takes good pictures, but i am disappointed it does not have red-eye control, or control for shaky hands. My last Canon had both features 
21338 4 This is a pretty decent camera actually for the money! Very clear video and easy to use interface... It s not perfect but for the money I can t ask for more. 
21339 4 I ll never lose my camera lens cap again! 
21340 4 It s been over two years and still works perfectly even after I peeled it up and repositioned it 5 times. Battery died once. Only sad aspect is you can t change the tone length. Beeps 3 times for probably 4-5 seconds. 
21341 4 Would buy again 
21342 4 Ok 
21343 4 Awesome 
21344 4 I love this bag! It s light, fits my laptop has room for other stuff and travels great! 
21345 4 works as advertised. 
21346 4 I like this tool....glad to see that this cardboard technology is still used.. 
21347 4 Best sound ive heard after trying a few different mics. 
21348 4 Love this, and the fact it has multiple uses. I ve used it with my camera, and my microphone. Works great and is really stable and flexible. 
21349 4 Great accessory. Very strong lamp mount, will not go anywhere. 
21350 4 I m very proud of these items. These items arrived just in time as expected; I m very proud of them. 
21351 4 this product is just the right tool to eliminate the hard light on faces, I tried it with my little girl and they were able to handle the brightness. it is difficult to set it up on the LED light, but nothing that some Sticky backs can t handle. 
21352 2 They would have been nice if the collimation had been correct. I ended up getting the &#34;Nikon 7238 Action Ex Extreme 8 X 40 mm&#34; and I have been happy with them. 
21353 3 buy for a friend 
21354 4 Gets used every day at work. Easy point and shoot, or you can take movies. 
21355 0 Horrible design. Too short (I m 6&#34; feet tall) and the loops kept catching on my shirt everytime I pulled the camera up. 
21356 3 Works great. It is a little heavy. 
21357 3 Price was great and batteries are holding charge just fine. 
21358 2 Its cheap and nothing extraordinary about this. you get what you pay for.. which is mediocre 
21359 4 great set up in bag with &#34;cleaning&#34; sticker, and protector x2 and a large micro fiber cloth. good value, does the job. 
21360 3 Woks great with the camera. 
21361 4 this offers some really interesting perspectives. I use it with my telephoto lens. Tip: great for take large group selfies!!!! 
21362 0 took horrible pictures when it did work...most the time it wouldn t come on. 
21363 4 Excellent product. 
21364 4 I have bought Wasabi batteries for several cameras and I have never had a problem. They work just as well as the name brand, but cost much less. The included charger with international and car adapters is a nice plus too. 
21365 4 Just got - took about 10 minutes to setup, looks better than pics, good price, smooth operation, easy to use and pic quality is also good. If anything changes - will surely update this review. Thanks [owned it for only an hour] 
21366 4 A lot stronger than the case that came with it. 
21367 4 I loved this purchase. Seriously great quality items for a great price! AVAWO is where its going down!! 
21368 4 Yaaaaaaaaas, blows dust away from my sensor. My images are happy :) 
21369 4 This was just what I was looking for to replace old DVR. Works great. Had a small issue with viewing on phone but customer service talked me through it in a few minutes. 
21370 1 Never used it under water, the pictures are blurry on land what would it look like under water.. 
21371 4 Excellent, good prices and shipping time was quik, 
21372 4 This is a really great trialed for the price. Very easy to set up. Already enjoying it on my deck. Great company, shipped fast and safe. Would highly recommend. 
21373 4 product delivered as promised product as explained in description no problem 
21374 4 Awesome 
21375 4 I think it has all been said. I know of no downside to this lens. 
21376 4 Bought this for my dad and he loves it. It was easy to set up and he likes the remote control options. He shows this off whenever he has guests! 
21377 2 You get what you pay for.. mount secures well but materials are what you would expect for price. Even after securing screw better the hinge still has some play that will wobble on rough terrain. 
21378 4 Great Camera, good video quality, awesome accessories, exceptional value! 
21379 4 I love this funky camera. It takes flattering photos of people with its slightly soft focus and vintage tint. 
21380 3 the tripod works great but was damaged in shipping would buy again but from a different supplier 
21381 4 Camera came as advertised...like new...with a quick delivery turn around time 
21382 3 as described 
21383 3 Nice for the price and simple to set up. 
21384 0 don t buy it trust me. Waste of time and money!!! 
21385 0 I just purchased the camera and I can t even get the LED light to turn green so that I can connect it. I will be returning the camera. 
21386 4 Great camera! 
21387 4 one of the best N nikon lenses 
21388 4 good resolution, no space 
21389 4 holds my gopro securely to tthe tripod i have, and the camera slides easily in and out of the pegs. great product, shipped fast 
21390 4 looks like the real thing. Quality? Time will tell. 
21391 4 Fast delivery and a great deal! 
21392 4 Great value! Works just fine, good picture quality. Overall very satisfied with the purchase, especially with customer service. Received an extra battery when I notified that one of the batteries was not functioning! Overall a great buy! 
21393 4 Great tripod for I-Phone. Works well with 6 plus 
21394 4 I love it! Thank you! 
21395 1 Quality is okay but the bigger cover gets in the way of the lens if fully extended 
21396 1 Bought for the convenience and after one day at SDCC the strap keeps unhooking and I almost dropped my camera. I honestly would not recommend this strap, try another brand. 
21397 4 The last pack of 10 didn t come in the box, but it doesn t look like it was messed with! It arrived on time and I m super happy to have more film!! 
21398 4 good 
21399 4 perfect for the job I needed it for. 
21400 4 Haven t tested it under the conditions I plan yet, but setup and test runs worked great. Simple setup and good response; using a Sony A3000 
21401 0 The only difference between this cap and the one that comes with it is a rubber gasket! What a ripoff. Should have come with the camera in the first place. 
21402 4 Had trouble port forwarding the F19821P camera on a Netgear/Frontier DSL modem/router and called support. Richard, the tech support remotely accessed my computer and quickly resolved my problem. Great camera. I thank Foscam and Richard for the support. 
21403 3 The tech was very helpful & solved my problem Thanks 
21404 3 So far so good. Lots to learn about it yet. 
21405 4 The best fake camera on the market. It looks far better than the very cheap one being sold under a dozen names on Amazon. This one looks real! 
21406 4 very happy 
21407 4 FANTASTIC set! Love this portrait lens and all the goodies that came with it. 
21408 4 great kit to have for your trip 
21409 4 This grip fit my new 70D perfectly and shipped very fast. I am interested in extending my shooting time but the added controls on the grip will come in very handy. I m definitely a very happy customer. 
21410 3 it does seems to loose charge faster than factory battery. Great value for money can t go wrong with price I paid. 
21411 4 good protection 
21412 4 This is a wonderful little camera. There have been moments when I missed an eyepiece but outside that it has been very good. It takes excellent pictures, and it feels very well balanced in my hand. 
21413 4 My son loves this kit. Everything he ever needed for his GoPro, and more! 
21414 4 ok 
21415 4 Exactly what I was looking for. Thanks 
21416 4 I misplaced my orginal charger and this one is a good replacement. It somes with an accesory adaptor, USA and Eoropean power adaptor. Great bargain with two batteries. 
21417 4 as expected 
21418 4 good , fast shipping , that s great :) 
21419 4 They reflect light really well and the addition of 5 colors is really nice. 
21420 4 Great deal for a great camera! 
21421 4 Clear protection and great fit... Definitely recommended. 
21422 4 Quick shipping. Works great 
21423 4 I think this is pretty nice and although I only have a regular video camera, it is important because I might drop it like I always do to my phone 
21424 4 I don t have one of these monopods but all of the reviews below that I have read are not even for this item but some tripod!!!!!! This looks great to me especially for the price. 
21425 4 Best thing to hold both my Garmin AND my NyteRyder 600 headlight! 
21426 4 It work as advertise, all my old Minolta lenses work great in my Samsung NX500 and NX1100. 
21427 4 I really like this. Works well. 
21428 3 Good Product at the right price. They are a little on the lower quality end but they are not expensive either. 
21429 4 Simply magical difference in sharpness and color of photos now 
21430 2 bag was nice and very well padded. I didn t like the color as it was not as tan as the picture showed, probably due to flash. The bad is actually a weird brown color 
21431 2 Fogged up 15-20 minutes when camera was only exposed not submerged. Didnt fit my sony cybershot snug, had to really squeeze camera case to take pictures 
21432 4 Great lens. 
21433 3 This is a great lens hood. At first it was a little difficult to figure out how to put it onto my camera, but after I got it I ve been taking great photos. 
21434 4 Good fit,. Good replacement. Even survived the most horrific, mangled trip through the post office imaginable. 
21435 4 These were fantastic. Needed them for an impromptu fashion shoot and they worked perfectly. The giant CFL bulbs mimic daylight very well and that s what I used them for, to enhance the natural daylight on an indoors shoot. Easy, light, and flexible. 
21436 0 Couldnt get it to work. 
21437 3 Cables working great , been in use for a while. 
21438 4 Amazingly simple, Will probably get another set. I did swap the disk for a larger one. Mine came with a WD green drive. 
21439 0 Do not use this adpter with zeiss. It fried my zeiss Otus lens. It had to be sent back and the lens chip had to be replaced. the aperature could no longer be changed. 
21440 4 needed a small cable to plug into the back of my car radio , this fit the bill perfectly 
21441 4 Great bag 
21442 4 Nice protection 
21443 0 Bad, several of the item came broken, including lens, tripod, etc. 
21444 4 This is my third shell replacement. Works like a charm every time. The fact that it comes with screws is incredibly helpful, just in case. 
21445 4 Just got it for my Nikon Coolpix L840 - perfect size. I was going to get another bag for 3x the cost basically just because it was purple - glad I got this. 
21446 4 I suddenly lose lenses cap while travelling This bundle really helped me in protecting my camera lenses. I always keep a spare cap It funny that i haven t last the cap since i purchased the bundle! 
21447 4 Holds out for the entire worship service. We ll see if it will hold out for a nearly two hour cantata. 
21448 4 Very good glass. 
21449 4 Very helpful 
21450 2 Slightly off. 
21451 4 This allows me to have enough juice to record to the limit of the storage capacity. GREAT! 
21452 4 Great Value at a great price. I love it! 
21453 4 Nice case for what I wanted, which was a compact case to carry on occasion my D7000 with an 18 - 200 attached. This fits snugly without any extra room. 
21454 3 Exactly what I needed 
21455 0 Not good at all. Don t bother, save your time, energy, and money. 
21456 4 i like it 
21457 4 LOVE IT! using it for reviewing training tracks with my dog, works great, easily adjustable to other people also. 
21458 2 It s ok, I didn t realize that it didn t have a view finder for the eye. I am going to give the camera away to my daughter and try another one. 
21459 4 Goes with BG-E16 
21460 3 Works very well for my Application TY 
21461 0 The control just have approx. 10 ft of range, so I have to open the door to connect and disconnect the sensor. That s really does not work. 
21462 4 Great Lens, great sharpness and nice to low light and mid-telephoto lens. 
21463 4 Great 
21464 4 Does the job at a great price. 
21465 0 Waterproof camera, nope. First time used, Lid popped open, camera ruined. Lid is impossible to close. Call Coleman, they will not back product. Called elite brands who actually make the camera for a month straight, they will not call back. This camera is a waste of money. Do not buy. 
21466 4 it is wonderful. I have two. 
21467 4 Fits just as it s supposed to. Thanks. 
21468 4 Way too fun and very dangerous too 
21469 0 It wasn t with complet cable or (USB) I bought additional VGA USB from best buy. It doesn t have full instruction. Poor quality 
21470 4 Fits nicely on the headstrap. Headstrap with camera mounted doesn t even get close to being able to sink. Don t even notice the float pro attached when wearing the headstrap. 
21471 4 Good 
21472 3 Works great for the price. First one didn t fit and I received a new one that did fit the next day. 
21473 4 I use this to house a Sony CX-900 and it s just right for that size camera with the accessories I use with it. The lock is a bit of a joke but that doesn t matter to me. Excellent protection at a reasonable price. 
21474 4 Must have for securely holding backdrops. These clamps are durable and reach fully around frame bars. Highly recommend. 
21475 4 Great backup batteries for your GoPro. Would definitely recommend to anybody looking for spares. 
21476 4 Love the sleek and stealthy look of this housing. 
21477 4 I love buying in bulk because technically it s cheaper. still, pretty pricey but IMO it s worth it. 
21478 4 Nice looking backpack a must have IF you are traveling 
21479 4 Lots of fun 
21480 4 Nice 
21481 4 Haven t spent a great deal of time using it yet. Lots of options and settings so I m reading through the manual. It does a good job in low light. The most impressive thing so far is how fast it auto-focuses. 
21482 4 Still getting used to the camera and settings, so far it has been a great camera for the money! 
21483 3 Not a bad set of batteries and had them for about a year and they have been very successful 
21484 2 Just as advertised. 
21485 4 AGAIN YOU CAN T BEAT THE PRICE AND IT WORK S GREAT... 
21486 4 Fits t3i perfectly. So glad i bought this. 
21487 4 Awesome deal, so much fabric for your money, I am very happy with my purchase. 
21488 4 I bought it for my 31 yr. old son for his birthday and he liked it. I like making him happy. 
21489 4 Just developed my pictures from Curaco. Amazing. 
21490 0 Doesn t really work especially with small lenses. 
21491 4 works great, great value, price. 
21492 3 Picture quality and refresh rate could be better, but all in all, quite useful. 
21493 0 I rec d the product quickly, but it is NOT &#34;plug and play&#34;. I could not make it work so I sent it back. 
21494 4 Works great 
21495 0 The quality of the plastic is way below par. I wouldn t recommend this product. 
21496 4 Very easy to install. Hard screen protector. Highly recommend to anyone who wants to protect there screen. 
21497 4 Works well 
21498 4 Love this lens!! 
21499 4 Works great!! Set up process took less than 10 minutes. Video quality is great. Real time monitoring works well. 
21500 4 Works great. Nobody comes up my driveway unannounced anymore. 
21501 0 material and graphics were not as expected 
21502 4 These are worth every penny. Great for cleaning my laptop screen, cell phone screen and glasses. 
21503 4 Very handy accessory. I ll also use as a light source in my macro photography. 
21504 4 Holds a charge for a long time. 
21505 4 Good price. What more to say 
21506 4 Great item that is durable and easy to use! 
21507 3 perfecta 
21508 4 easy to operate 
21509 0 Didn t work at all 
21510 4 This tripod is the nicest tool for your filmmaking I used this were ever I go has good grip and it can hold my a7s with lens with no problems 
21511 3 So far working as advertised. No complaints 
21512 4 Very basic, but it does the trick when you want something lightweight and easy to carry. 
21513 4 Great value!!! 
21514 4 Works great, surpassed my expectations 
21515 0 bad 
21516 3 Works. 
21517 4 Great! 
21518 4 Super sick - Came quick! Would Buy again. 
21519 4 A++++++++++ 
21520 4 This is the second Altura UV lens filter that I have bought. I m happy with both. Great product for the cost! 
21521 3 My daughter loved all the accessories and would have been even better if it included the photo paper. 
21522 4 Awesome & reasonable product. Photoshopping after was a breeze and very clean. My pictures came out great !! 
21523 4 It is exactly what I ordered and what I expected 
21524 3 rec d as promised and as advertised 
21525 4 Love it 
21526 4 Works great!! 
21527 4 Love the zoom...wish image was better stabilized at full zoom but still impressive... 
21528 2 Was not the color shown. This case is black. I really wanted the grey version. Still it s a pelican. 
21529 4 I dropped my gopro by accident still ok bec of this case. 
21530 4 The best Adult toy! Been having a blast using it with our children. Strongly recommend adult supervision with young children. 
21531 4 I had to return the Camera, but leaving a review because getting credited for the Square Trade warranty was quick and painless. Thanks! 
21532 4 Love it,want to order another one! 
21533 3 It works 
21534 0 Terrible, System stopped powering up after 2 months. Out of Amazon return time, and Zmodo is giving me the RMA run around. Get a better brands 
21535 3 Good product. But field of view is small 
21536 3 Nice quality for the price! My dad recently dug out his old tripod that was more expensive than this one, and you can tell that this one is cheaper. But even so, it will do the job nicely and feels stable enough. I m happy with it! 
21537 4 itwas everthing that I hoped for. 
21538 4 Goid as described 
21539 4 The charger and battery worked perfectly for my 10 year old camer. 
21540 4 great value 
21541 4 Does everything it s supposed to. I clip this on my belt, so I don t use the strap that comes with it. Construction seems good and it fits the camera nicely. So, nothing to fault this on, which qualifies if for 5 stars. 
21542 4 Works as expected, its a red light to use while you are in darkness using ones Telescope. I saves your night vision. 
21543 4 Excellent quality, still working great 
21544 3 Serves it purpose for the price 
21545 4 Great product for the money more than met my expectations. 
21546 0 This item does not charge the battery. 
21547 4 I purchased this item to photo small collectibles. They are easy to handle one handed therefore you can easily adjust the extra light one sometimes needs. 
21548 4 I could not find this anywhere! I have a Nikon Coolpix, and I lost this cable. It works just as good as the original. Good price for it too! Got here quickly. 
21549 4 This was a wonderful by die package! My wireless remote was not wireless though... But even with that alteration, you can t go wrong with all the gadgets you get with such a high quality camera for the price! 
21550 4 Excellent, delivered on time, was as described, great customer service (if contacted) 
21551 4 Excelente! 
21552 2 Wish it would mount on the lens backwards for better storage when not in use 
21553 4 Great product at great price. I have other systems more expensive cost and the same funcion. ZOSI results very easy to instal and friendly in web. The QR code is realy a goog idea to make an easy conection with my movil device. 
21554 4 Very handy to have while traveling. Was able to have battery life to film/photograph every second of the 4 dives a day for 7 days. These batteries seemed to last (Though I don t know for sure) longer than the GoPro branded one that came with the camera. 
21555 4 GoPro auto charger is very handy. 
21556 4 Worked great with IPhone 6 plus. 
21557 2 Ok cloths but not as high quality as other cloths I got with my new glasses 
21558 4 Great sound quality and nice and slim/light. 
21559 3 I got everything I was promised The package arrived on time well worth $19 and change...Jed 
21560 1 fell apart in a week 
21561 4 works great with my Sony alpha 3000 , it s water proof .Arrived in a few days, it s exactly what I needed 
21562 4 This looks completely real. Lights up nicely too giving the impression it is legit 
21563 1 I m going to keep it because I can make it work, but it is disappointing that the strap won t tighten up enough to stay on my wrist. Service and delivery was excellent. 
21564 4 Perfect. Reliable and easy to install. 
21565 3 Decent product for the money 
21566 3 works great cheap price. 
21567 2 Good! 
21568 3 Can anyone tell me how to get ahold of fujifilm? My camera came with no lens nor batteries? 
21569 4 works great!!!! 
21570 4 Love my new filter! Great service, thank you! 
21571 4 Will buy again 
21572 4 camera is beautiful BUT one setting (the house one) only draws out plain white pictures so just put it on another setting. 
21573 4 It works well I also going to buy the stunt man harness gives extra positions for the stuff I m into 
21574 3 They work very well 
21575 4 Batteries work as expected. And were really cheap! So 5⭐️ I guess. With a product like this, it can really only be either 5⭐️ Or 1⭐️ Either it works or doesn t. And the batteries do last a fairly long time. 
21576 4 Perfect! I have been looking for something like this FOREVER. Now I don t have to wear pants with pockets when I shoot =P 
21577 4 Great price, great service, and great quality! 
21578 4 Pretty good item 
21579 4 fantastic. used for a few months now, no issues. setup was a breeze if you know a little about technology. IR is WAY better than expected. truly commercial grade 
21580 4 Great camera to have. 
21581 3 Item arrived quickly in good condition. Easy to use. The mini tripod that came with it broke after a couple of uses. Overall nice product. 
21582 4 Standard military issue NVG mount. Hardware fits just right. We ll see how it lasts, but seems pretty sturdy. 
21583 4 What a great camera this has been. Small in size but it can take some great pictures! Plenty of settings and the video quality is good as well. Didnt think I would use the feature to transfer to/from my phone but it is handy 
21584 4 Good product, good delivery 
21585 0 Auto focus does not work on Tamron 150-600. Will be returning, not as advertised. 
21586 3 It was very good 
21587 4 Excellent 
21588 1 It didn t come with the blower, which I was looking forward for 
21589 3 Bought it as a gift which has brought joy and many thanks. 
21590 2 battery did not seem to hold its charge. 
21591 4 These are original props and fit perfectly! 
21592 3 Not exactly as I wanted but I am using it for past 2 years. Product is working 
21593 4 It works well :) 
21594 4 These last quite a long time when used to power a video light. 
21595 4 Solid construction, so far all ports work. Plugs up via usb. Love that feature since it allows me to charge all via external powerbank! 
21596 2 It works but is pretty rinky dink. I wouldn t put a really expensive flash on this. 
21597 4 Great little kit , would recommend ;) 
21598 4 Are you kidding me??? This is the best camera I ve ever purchased to date!!! 
21599 4 It s a battery 
21600 4 A small, fabulous camera with the bells and whistles of a professional s camera 
21601 4 Very light and easy to use. 
21602 4 My daughter love it,and I do also we took it to a trip and it s so cool to experience instant pic without been able to edit or repeat it 100 times.LOL 
21603 4 Thanks 
21604 4 I don t like typing 
21605 3 easy to install and use i have 3 cams.One died early but we have had a really wet summer 
21606 4 This mini tripod has amazing applications for specialized photo situations. 
21607 4 bought used mint condition pics are sharp couldn t be any happier with it 
21608 4 Super helpful for photographers like me! 
21609 4 good 
21610 2 Good product battery life low 
21611 4 This is a fun and must have accessory to any GoPro camera 
21612 2 The FloarPro looks like it is good quality, but I used this about twice and one of the plastic mounts snapped rendering it useless. 
21613 4 For hiking, catching a quick shot in the mist. This product is THE Best! 
21614 4 Good products I would like to get two more of them. 
21615 4 Great replacement battery. No issues, I used it to shoot a wedding and it held charge for the whole event. 
21616 4 Pretty nice tripod arrived a day early too 
21617 1 Low quality pictures 
21618 4 thought this was a bigger case, it won t fit my camcorder but it will be ideal for my camera 
21619 4 Good quality. Have had this for a few years now. 
21620 0 They are not a Clear view distributor. none of the product has warranty. Not approved by company. 
21621 4 I ve got to say, these filters definitely are worth the price! The package came in perfect condition, ad the filters work great, although the cool only works at a certain angle lighting and what not, but overall it is worth five stars!! 
21622 4 Great addition for the GoPro 
21623 4 Love it! Works great with my Nikon D3300 I just got. No more running to get in the picture in the allotted seconds! Makes for much more relaxed group photos! 
21624 3 Foscam cameras work pretty well for me, except I have been worried about hackers logging into my cameras. I just set up my 4th camera however and the customer representative named Walter was knowledgeable and professional. 
21625 4 Excellent control, does exactly as described. No problems yet! 
21626 4 Worked as replacement well 
21627 4 I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it! She loves cameras and she tells me that the quality of these work perfectly fine! 
21628 4 It works. Light alum material. Works as advertised. Will buy again. 
21629 4 Fits perfect for 27 mm lense. Comes with polarzer and UV filters. Only dow fall is lack of compact holding case. 
21630 4 Amazing!!! Lighting is perfect and very easy to set up! 
21631 4 Organization, good. 
21632 4 This is a great little camera for the semi pto or starter. It is versitile, has almost all the same components as higher end cameras, and takes great shots. Money well spent! 
21633 4 works fine. 
21634 4 Fits my iPad Mini and is well made. 
21635 4 Good and fit just right 
21636 4 Had to modify a bit to fit on my tripod but it works perfectly 
21637 4 Bought these to replace a stock lens cap holder that no longer sticks. These fit the lens. No issues so far, and with the 10 pack, it s not a big deal if they don t end up being durable. 
21638 4 A very satisfactory product. worth the money spent on it. The picture clarity is amazing. Captures the minute details with perfection. 
21639 4 Great quality for this price. Fits perfectly for Canon Rebel T1i. 
21640 4 Fit my NX1000 stock lense perfectly. 
21641 0 Didn t work 
21642 4 This battery was perfect and just what I was looking for. This also shipped promptly and arrived when I was advised it would arrive. Thank you. 
21643 4 love it! 
21644 4 Very good! 
21645 4 I love it! 
21646 4 I am still learning to use this camera but I have already took some very good quality pictures and the zoom is impressive. I am very happy with this purchase 
21647 4 Came quick and did the job. 
21648 4 Great value for the money. 
21649 0 Extremely Poor Image resolution. We were very glad we tested this before going on our trip. Spend the extra few bucks on the GoPro hero and you will be as thankful for the decision as we were. 
21650 4 going to use this for a guest book for my grandmothers 90th birthday. got it today and tried it out... took everything for me to not use all the film :) 
21651 4 Great and fast way to capture moments. It s so fun to take pictures with this camera! The product is exactly as described and adorable! 
21652 0 Not worth the money 
21653 0 I have Canon 6D and I couldn t get it to work even after spending 3 hours trying to adjust it. 
21654 4 No problems, delivered quickly 
21655 4 got this for my mother in-law who lost hers. it was exactly whatt she needed and she was vary happy with it 
21656 3 Great product! 
21657 4 Must have for any go pro user 
21658 4 I love this camera! I can t say enough good things about it. Handy size. 
21659 4 Great product 
21660 4 Love using this reflector in my photography!!! 
21661 4 Arrived as expected and works well. 
21662 4 Love my Nikon. Easy to use and great pictures. 
21663 4 Love this purchase! The camera works lovely, looks nice, and the pictures turn out great. Really brings back memories using this camera, so happy with it! 
21664 4 Thanks 
21665 4 ... perfect size for my unit... and not that easy to get anywhere... 
21666 4 Everything works as described. This is one of my most important toolset to own. Love it. 
21667 4 Superfast service and superb quality from this company - this is excellent &#34;no news&#34; news, I d say. You will, too. 
21668 0 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NBNJZEK?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00 
21669 3 Perfect, just what I wanted. 
21670 4 is very good 
21671 4 work with my hero 3 blk 
21672 4 Great product. It is everything I need 
21673 4 This one works great. 
21674 4 In answer to a posted question, yes. this is a true FX lens and a superb one. It works beautifully with my d810 as well as being an excellent portrait lens with my d7100. 
21675 0 The case appeared decent but the top clip had chipped so no use. Quality control issue. Returned for refund and getting different brand soon. 
21676 3 Love this camera. Works really well. Still reading through the owners manual there is a lot to learn. I love the built in wifi though, such a great feature! 
21677 2 Does its job for website photography for our shop. Quality is on the cheaper side, but it s fully functional and so far its been reliable. I ve had it about 8 months now. No problems. I use it for product shots. 
21678 4 Its wire for a specific function. What more can I say? 
21679 4 These cameras are Awesome! Unbelievable clarity, and capability to pan and zoom. They ROCK! 
21680 4 The protector seems to be of a high standard. I may just have been lucky, but the application process went smoothly. No scratches noted so far, and no bubbles. Overall, very satisfied. 
21681 4 Great! 
21682 4 Just recieved my new Drone for my son, he absolutely loves it. Great first Drone for someone starting out flyine one.. 
21683 1 This product does not support the 5-in-1 diffuser made by the same company.I couldn t get it to stand up with the diffuser attached. the legs didnt open wide enough (they never do, do they?) and didnt offer enough support. It constantly fell over as soon as I let go. 
21684 4 I tell everyone to buy these as baby monitors because they re much better and cheaper than the average or even top-of-the-line baby monitors. 
21685 4 good product 
21686 4 Great props! Aircraft even seems more stable and quiet. 
21687 4 Received on time and packed very well. I charged both batteries and tested them in my new Sony camera and they worked perfect. I recommend this item. 
21688 0 Waste of money 
21689 4 Exactly what I wanted it works with the car charger as well, if you have more then one battery I would highly recommend buying one of these, I have no problems with this product at all 
21690 2 I tried the X-rite on my Mac Book pro and my colors are still bad. Then I tried with an external monitor, A 27&#34; View-sonic VX2703MH-LED and see no change at all. I created a new user, the profile is just perfect. 
21691 4 Very useful for road riding for beginners 
21692 4 This slider is great for the price! It s really helped me grow a lot. It s sturdy too! 
21693 2 Was smaller than what I needed, but would make a nice office desk decor 
21694 4 Thanks 
21695 4 Product was delivered as promised and it was exactly as pictured and described. Will order from Digital Goja again in the future. 
21696 0 As far as I ve seen this little thing should come with a piece (adapter / marker) to set it properly.. Well!! Good news doesn t come with it, so now I have to invent by myself how assemble it. 
21697 4 Great piece does what I need it to do. Not sure how the auto focus is because I am using a manual focus lens with it. 
21698 4 Not expensive, comes with a double side charger. Works well with my Xiaomi YI. 
21699 4 This frame is great! I haven t had it long so I haven t programmed it for all the things it can do, but I have read the manual and I look forward to taking advantage of all the great features! 
21700 4 It is perfect!!! so compact and works great. Came just in time to charge for my trip to the Oregon Coast with the family! Can even charge in the car!!!! 
21701 4 Great product - fast delivery!!!! 
21702 4 Great company. The security cameras are perfect. Built to last. The picture quality is very nice, night vision is incredible. 5 star 
21703 4 Excellent 
21704 4 Really bright. Don t look into light. Get the diffusion cover. Must get Sony type battery separately to use light. Bluer than sunlight. Works well with reflector umbrella. 
21705 2 Needs styrofoam backing to make it fit GoPro 
21706 4 Looks good, comfortable to use and my camera can fit nicely into it. 
21707 1 1 camera worked the second would never turn on. 
21708 4 Good 
21709 4 have had limited usage yet but seems great - especially for the price 
21710 0 it takes a fulls second to catch up when you look left or right. i would not recommend these glasses. 
21711 4 terrific unit..great quality for the price...range 1,000 ft !!!!! 
21712 4 Great product! 
21713 4 very good performance 
21714 4 bought this for my wife maybe a little more than she can handle but a very nice camera. 
21715 3 Love the look and no more back pain from my previous slings! My favorite camera harness yet. Great for women with larger bust lines. Only slight issues with loose clothing getting caught and pinching of skin when not wearing sleeves. 
21716 4 Great 
21717 0 do not ever use proper cardsthey don t work and you re screwed if you do use them 
21718 4 I like it. I am excited to use it when my is at college and I can see him and talk with him. 
21719 4 Replaced my 832 that died. Works great. 
21720 4 Just what I needed. 
21721 0 Not happy about how Amazon recommends this with the Meike 910 and it doesn t work with it! When it did light up, I found it didn t make a difference with my flash and now the battery pack won t power up at all. 
21722 0 The chopper came dysfunctional; two propellers gave out after the 2nd flight. I went to return it, but there return policy expires the day after you received it. BEWARE of the return policy, it s not enough given time to return it. 
21723 4 Really cool little camera. Great fun to use. Pulls you into the world of creative videography. Fun!, Fun!, Fun! 
21724 4 I realy like thar it also came with a car charger adapter. 
21725 4 great for traveling 
21726 0 I have an issue. I bought these a few months ago and everything worked perfect besides one pack! The last pack is inside the Polaroid but nothing comes out. I am pissed about this. 
21727 4 Great brace. I use it with a set of very large x56mm objective binoculars. I set the brace up to sit where my abdomen meets my sternum or atop my Alaskian Guide Creations bino pack. 
21728 4 Alvin Mathhews was very good and a gentlemanvery patient and knowlegeable 
21729 4 GREAT camera! 
21730 4 They charge fast and last forever running a 7in HD IPS field monitor. The included 12v adapter provides charging in the field where there is a cig lighter or 12vDC acc plug. 
21731 3 Works great looks great 
21732 2 the system works great.. but the Uniden App is totally lost.. Uniden Company needs to fix this ASAP 
21733 4 For it s size, this is incredibly durable. Most small &#34;travel&#34; tripods are cheap junk. This isn t. I love it. 
21734 4 nice nice 
21735 2 item was same as description. The shipping was fast. I would recommend this seller. item not that great 
21736 0 Waste of your money. Would not recommend buying this product. 
21737 3 This is quite a nice addition for my portable video shoots of presenters using a curtain backdrop. The bulbs can be replaced with brighter ones if needed. Good quality materials and the videos are greatly improved using the lighting setup. 
21738 4 The camera is cute and perfect starter camer for my tween daughter. She s learning all the modes and is inspired to take good photos. This will help her be on her way! 
21739 3 ok 
21740 4 I recieved this as a gift to replace a very old HEAVY tripod. It is a great replacement, much lighter to carry but holds my Nikon D3300 great! 
21741 0 I couldn t use the power button or the side button that switched it from vibrate to ringer once the case was on. 
21742 4 this product is a great replacement item for the one that came with the camera. 
21743 3 works great with camera 
21744 2 This is the Fuji flagship ttl flash for the x-series cameras... It s pretty limited in features, the lcd user interface is pretty terrible, has no slave mode (infrared, optical, or otherwise) it s only getting 3 stars because it does get the exposure settings right 
21745 2 Works good. 
21746 4 I ended up returning this item ONLY because it was not appropriate for the size of our system. Otherwise, it provided a nice spotlight for our cameras. 
21747 4 Work as advertised. It s nice to have backup power when making a long hike or bicycling trip. 
21748 4 good camera for the price, will recommend to friends. 
21749 0 Tris is a pes of s*** i was flaing around 200m and The drone fail down because a stall motor 
21750 4 I just need the nuts 
21751 4 I am loving this monitor right now. Super clear. For the price I am getting exactly what I needed. The refresh rate at times is delayed slightly but other than that I am satisfied with this purchase. Fast shipment as well. 
21752 0 Quick delivery from Amazon,Drone sucks NO directions,NO parts sheet,NO tec support,High priced junk,China crap BUY AMERICAN 
21753 2 Kinda cheap. You have to be directly in front of the camera which makes it not that valuable to me. Would not buy again. 
21754 4 calvin was great help 
21755 4 I have purchased two of these for my cameras. It was two of the easiest installations I have ever made. It goes on so quickly and before you know it is attached to the screen just as pretty as you please. 
21756 4 good stuff 
21757 4 Works great. It charges the battery very quickly. I d purchase again. 
21758 4 Perfect replacement battery form my older Olympus camera. 
21759 4 This is the perfect camera for my wife to get into photography with. 
21760 2 This camera works well, although it s limited as far as it s monitor capability. It s battery life is good and it take excellent high quality shots. I didn t like the menu structure and that is perhaps the biggest challenge. However its great for action 
21761 4 Worked and fit like original Canon Batteries 
21762 0 This arrived broken. I realize that it is inexpensive, but I didn t expect it to arrive already broken. It was unusable to me for the project for which I ordered it. 
21763 4 Haven t had to use it yet, but good to have! 
21764 1 The software stinks, poorly designed with no real instructions. While it does work, if doe s not my needs. 
21765 4 Fine 
21766 1 Ok for the price but NOT 32X. I tested it against my 10x Vortex monocular and it s magnification is less than the Vortex. It appears to be 8x, which is nowhere near 32x. I guess for the money it s not too bad for an 8x monocular. 
21767 4 amazing bag, tough and well organised 
21768 4 Easy to set up. Worked good. Shipping slow. 
21769 2 One battery died in a month or so. 
21770 1 The cameras are not wireless. So you have to have a plug wherever you place them which means they can not be DISCREET. 
21771 4 It s an eye cup. Nothing much to say about it. Replacement for one that fell off. 
21772 4 Excellent!!! Perfect time to arrive sooner than they promise .... Love it !!! 
21773 4 Great product, worked as described. Just what I needed. 
21774 4 This filter works great for long exposure photography. I really like the Lee system. You must learn how to use these filters properly, but when you do, you can get some outstanding photos. 
21775 4 charged the batteries up works great 
21776 4 For the price I didn t have very high expectations....that was a mistake! it exceeded all my expectations. About 2 seconds after I unpacked it I had it up and running...so simple to use 
21777 4 Enjoying this lens, I live where there are a lot of wildlife (deer, bobcats, turkeys, foxes etc) and I have gotten some great shots with this lens without spooking the animals. 
21778 4 The best 3-axis tripod I ve ever used. Very intuitive, strong, durable and functional. Not cheap, but worth the investment. Try buying 3 cheap ones and compare that to the cost of one nice one! 
21779 4 Excellent 
21780 3 Just a perfect purchasing experience: item was in stock, treated to timely delivery, and worked as expected lot of the box. No issues atoll; highly recommended. 
21781 4 Good Product. 
21782 3 great buy...a few dings but works perfectly !!!! 
21783 3 Works very well. 
21784 4 Small compact great product. 
21785 4 Love it! I also purchased the cell phone mount for my note 4 and it totally fits my needs! 
21786 4 just what I needed 
21787 1 They re poor quality and didn t seem to be put together properly, some louder than others, some batteries came dead and had to be replaced. Some people are saying there s a feature to make them ding when the door opens. Mine have 2 options, On/Off that s it. 
21788 4 Does what it is supposed to do. I don t think it needs extended review... 
21789 4 Happy with my purchase. 
21790 4 Great, still works perfectly after about 4 months 
21791 4 Bought as a replacement for another brand s replacement plastic latch. So far this one has done the trick! It might be a bit heavier but it is both strong and doesn t look loud like other colors of anodized aluminum 
21792 4 Excellent videos recorded and simple set up. 
21793 3 It has a great build made of metal only. The screw for the hotshoe unscrews easily so the whole thing swivels often. 
21794 4 This is a great little camera. Everything I expected. Happy with the purchase! 
21795 4 Charges as quickly and as well as original in first my two uses. Thicker than Canon original but not as wide; still fits in my bag easily. Haven t tried car adapter yet. 
21796 3 Works well and good price. 
21797 4 Honestly, I was super surprised by the quality of this bag. This bag is EXCELLENT for a amateur photographer (like me!) :) and $24.99?! The canon equivalent of this bag at best buy is at least $60! 
21798 4 I own two of these, great price I ll keep buying them for shure. 
21799 2 Slips off the strap too easily 
21800 4 Easy to install in wood as long as you don t hit buried screws or nails. Unobtrusive. 
21801 2 This stand doesn t hold more then 4 pounds. 
21802 4 Works great! I used on a 10hr plane ride to make a timelapse (http://andrewferguson.net/2015/08/15/seattle-to-heathrow-time-lapse/) and I had no issues. For $5, you can t go wrong with this. 
21803 0 Doesn t have a button to take picture 
21804 4 worth every penny!! plug into your camera and record the future... 
21805 4 Best accessory investment I have made as an amateur photographer! 
21806 4 Kenneth was very professional and helpful and knowledgeable in setting up my Foscam camera on my computer and my smart phone. Easy to understand and knows his Foscam products well. Thank you 
21807 4 super 
21808 4 every thing ok 
21809 4 I ve had the system installed a couple of weeks now. For the price this thing is feature loaded. Does what it is supposed to do, easy install, customer support very helpful. 
21810 4 Works as advertised. Gave me great time lapse photos. 
21811 4 Very pleased 
21812 4 Great case when you don t want to carry around a lot of gear. Durable, well made. Stable base - can set it down and it won t topple. Suspension cradles camera and accommodates many lens sizes. 
21813 4 Very nice item to give as a gift! Thrilling to see &#34;baby&#34; pics with the gift I gave :) Quality materials...very pleased with this product for gift giving! 
21814 4 Nice Lens 
21815 3 It works fine--a little cumbersome to program until you get the hang of it. Range to receiver is quite short so positioning it at the end of the drive was difficult. 
21816 4 Everything works good 
21817 4 Love it! 
21818 4 thank you 
21819 4 It is good and delivery time was great 
21820 4 Very handy octopus cable (well, quadrapus) for powering multiple low-draw devices from one source. 
21821 4 The product excellent! Arrived on time! Love it. 
21822 4 Great batteries last longer than my original cannon battery. 
21823 3 Amature Photographer....It s a lot of stuff for the price. If you purchase this stuff separately you re going to pay 3x as much the flash is $60+ alone. I m having fun learning about all the different filter and playing with the lens. no problems with any of it 
21824 0 It does not work. It does not charge the battery. 
21825 4 I m very pleased with the flash and I feel the seller did a great job..... 
21826 3 the body camera, lense and other items are very good but I received a wrong usb cable which is from Canon and that cant t fix with my camera!! I need the right brand and fix one. please replace it. 
21827 4 Thea s blades are fairly balanced and arrived on time. I have used them off and on for a few weeks and have seen them take quite a beating. 
21828 4 The video and audio is amazing on these glasses I was very amazed how good they work and for a great price. 
21829 4 These slide were great! We used them for a STEM Day Camp and the youth loved them. 
21830 4 Fast setup, easy to tote around, perfect for me. 
21831 3 roduct as described received on schedule. 
21832 4 FYI.....There s a $200 rebate from Panasonic on this camcorder AG-AC90APJ. The last three letters must be APJ to qualify. http://www.bhphotovideo.com/FrameWork/Rebates_Promos/093015_PANA10_070115.pdf 
21833 0 The bottom, where the weights are, just slide off. Almost dropped my camera. TERRIBLE, DO NOT BUY THIS! 
21834 4 great product 
21835 4 This fit my camera correctly and works very well for the price. 
21836 2 Feels cheap but works, worried about it breaking 
21837 1 No instruction. Pass up 
21838 0 Junk ! the Bluetooth function doesn t work. I guess you get what you pay for. 
21839 2 This lens is much slower to focus and much louder (on my Sony A6000) than I had anticipated. I returned it and got the 35mm Sony, and I m much happier. 
21840 4 Perfect! 
21841 2 The tripod good for non DSLR camera, the bag it is very nice & the wire shutter release good for small DSLR like Nikon D3200 
21842 4 Excellent Product! 
21843 4 These items arrived in perfect condition and will be used by teachers in outdoor classroom science! 
21844 2 Had trouble closing binos enough to fit my eyes. 
21845 4 this item was delivered very fast and it works perfect. thanks 
21846 4 camera came promptly and is very helpful. great purchase. 
21847 4 Great case. Great build. Fits camera perfectly. 
21848 4 Works great for quick, on-the-go shoots! Easy to carry and set up. Recommend for sure. 
21849 4 just what I expected 
21850 3 I bought Two of these cameras to monitor and watch my dogs when I am at work. They are fantastic not only can I see the dogs but I can talk to them through the camera. 
21851 4 Awesome camera. 
21852 3 Sturdy and working great! 
21853 4 Used at water park, in lazy river and down big slides. Easy to hold no matter how many twists and turns. Worked great! 
21854 4 Love this frame! It helps a great grandmother feel in touch with everyone. Anyone would love this frame! Looks great and is easy to work. 
21855 3 this good price 
21856 4 Exactly what I expected to purchase. A little on the thicker side which is great. 
21857 4 Excellent camera, good security 
21858 0 Loved my purchase but it was used and the battery only lasted so many times before I packed it away. 
21859 4 I truly live this and will certainly recommend it to others 
21860 4 Perfect 
21861 3 Great accessory for the Go Pro ;) 
21862 4 If you can get the adjustments just right, this stabilizer is as good as they come for the doe. 
21863 4 works as expected 
21864 3 Works on my motorcycle, and fits my off brand GoPro knockoff 
21865 4 Great buy! 
21866 4 GREAT DEAL!!!!!!!!!! 
21867 2 OK - but too light to hold a Canon 5D Mk 3 with macro &#34;65&#34; lens. 
21868 1 Product did not keep the settings after several attempts to change them. Did not want to order another in event problem still existed with a new one. Looked cool though.. Went with a different dash cam that has worked great. 
21869 3 It seems like a pretty decent quality light bag. It keeps the light out. I m a little concerned the zipper is going to break, it feels very flimsy. 
21870 2 Unfortunately, this NVR was not compatible with my existing cameras and I Han to return it. The return process went very smoothly. 
21871 4 Perfect for the Sony NEX5T! 
21872 3 Good strong quality, much better than the cheap knockoffs. 
21873 4 excellent 
21874 4 Very easy setup, decent picture day and night, pan works well, half the price of others that don t have as good software. 
21875 4 Have it on my desk in the office. Gets lots of compliments for its clarity. 
21876 4 Used the camera on a recent 7 day cruise to Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. Took many great pictures. I really like the12x zoom and the camera s small size.It tucks away in a shirt pocket, but has the features of a much larger camera. 
21877 4 The image is better than my old cameras. 
21878 4 Definitely worth its money in twofold. sharp,accurate, light, easy to use. A good choice for an amateur I d say 
21879 2 Plate dose not have a griping strip on its surface causing plate to loosen from the lens ( Tamron 150-600 ) mounting base. Must carry Allen wrench for insurance while on a shoot. 
21880 3 Thank you. 
21881 2 Didn t expect much. Got what I paid for. Have used it for a few weeks with no problems. Attaches and removes easily. Just beware that you may pick up some silhouetting when fully extended. 
21882 3 This fits nicely around the body of my Nikon D5300. The silicon is a little slick, hopefully that won t last, as it is just that little bit slippery to the touch. It looks like all camera functions work perfectly, I m very happy with it. 
21883 4 Received as described and prompt shipping. Fits my Nikon D3200 perfectly and protects the LCD screen. 
21884 3 Fits tight on a 35-70 f/3.4 zoom, just like all the pro adapters I have bough from Fotodiox. A little too tight in that it s somewhat hard to remove from that lens, but not really a problem. 
21885 0 I only had it for a short time. I could not get it to work at all so I sent it back same day. 
21886 3 Does as advertized. Very sturdy and the length is perfect--though it is adjustable. This is my default, go to GoPro accessory. I have had it soaked in water and flailed around by friends yet no damage to the fabric at all. 
21887 4 It all went fine 
21888 3 Excelent for X-E2! forget the lensmate equivalent. 
21889 4 Perfect background for photos! Great quality. 
21890 4 Does all I want it to do and more!!!!! Very pleased with this purchase, THANKS AMAZON!!!! 
21891 1 The door of Fuji film s5000.3.1mp battery not working 
21892 4 It s thick black aluminum, and it s great! 
21893 4 Great lens. I use it with a D3100 at the moment. The wide aperture is great, I recommend a protective filter though because it would be very easy to scratch. 
21894 2 Vinyl is thick enough, but the product is not affixed the the cardboard core. Would also, be nice if the core was a larger size. Fair value product. 
21895 3 Usage very good can charge canon batterys as well 
21896 4 😀 
21897 4 Excellent 
21898 4 Great case, built really well. Fits my gopro hero4 perfectly. I would definitely buy more of their products. 
21899 4 I love my GoPro, Great quality, and great price for an awesome camera to last for a very long time! I use mine primarily for motorcycle rides. 
21900 4 Love it 
21901 3 this flash is great. 
21902 3 It protects very well, but you must observe their instructions for installattion re: eliminating all dust....I have a couple of small dust particles underneath that can t be removed... 
21903 4 A+ recommended to everyone. 
21904 4 never loss it in the ocean! 
21905 4 Excellent product. Received as promised schedule. 
21906 3 Great camera! A few accessories are unnecessary and probably will never be used, but overall I m very happy with the camera! 
21907 4 Works great! 
21908 4 Works as expected 
21909 3 Battery last long, remain full capacity after almost a year of using 
21910 4 Works great. At first had some issues with tilting to the left, but I contacted the manufacturer and following their detailed instructions was able to fix the tilt and stabilize correctly. Beware you need Windows PC to do that. It does not work with Apple. 
21911 4 This is ideal to keep from loosing a lens cover. I have been very pleased with it. 
21912 3 One of the screws that holds the umbrellas is bad, the screw will not move. 
21913 4 Excellent photo capture in the water, under the water or in the dry. Love it. 
21914 4 I feel this flash shoe umbrella holder is among the best. All metal construction, it solidly and securely holds my flash equipment. This is a well made product. 
21915 3 Would easily have given 5 stars if they had one additional feature, zoom. Otherwise an excellent value for the money paid. I purchased the factory reconditioned units, (same warranty as new), and am most pleased with their operation. 
21916 3 I bought others which don t hold a charge but these do. Higher priced but worth it. 
21917 0 The softbox very heavy for the the bracket, and the bracket start to bend in some area.!!! abd I could not tilt the softbox because of the weakness of the bracket and the totally wrong design. 
21918 4 Fits perfectly - excellent condition. 
21919 4 Just what I have been looking for. I have family photos that span the early 1900 s up to today. 
21920 4 I LOVE IT. works really well. blue nobs works well. awesome rig. could improve the barn doors for foldability. 
21921 4 This is the 3rd camera like this I have bought. I keep dropping them! It takes great pics and it s very close to professional for an auto digital. 
21922 0 Eyepiece would not screw into camera platform. I had to glue it? Not. Good!!!!!! 
21923 4 These are great. I ve used this brand for several years..all batteries and chargers are working like new 
21924 4 Works great for my CCTV cameras. 
21925 4 Great Product ! fit perfectly on my Olympus E-PL6 that mount on any Nikon Ais lenses , no regret purchase it 
21926 3 Tripod works great! Remote works great! Great deal! 
21927 2 Protects very well at a cost of making the camera bulkier. Excellent quality 
21928 4 Very nice, sharp. 
21929 4 Had an issue with the original hardware and was shipped one out to replace it immediately. Thank You! 
21930 4 This item is sturdy, strong and definitely worth the price. 
21931 4 Really nice! Quick shipping also 
21932 0 Worst tripod I ve ever used. Outside of it being very wobbly, the legs never extended properly. Just cheaply made in my opinion. 
21933 4 works great 
21934 4 Really like this speed light 
21935 4 I really like this camera case! So glad that I bought it! Fits my camera perfectly as described. 
21936 4 Love this case. Everone compliments it too. Looks very classy in white! I would highly recommend it. 
21937 4 Good 
21938 4 Other than the no on/off button or switch, it s great and easy to use. I ve never used a timer before, and I am a new DSLR owner, but I was able to figure it out with a quick glance at the manual (a REAL quick glance lol). 
21939 4 Fits good. 
21940 2 Can someone remind me why I bought this. Unless you have used it do not buy it(I would recommend Polarize filter). 
21941 4 Great film deal. Gift for my granddaughter. 
21942 1 I don t recommend this product. I think a gel filled strap or a single air cushion feels better than these mini air cushions. I m going to return this product. 
21943 4 They worked for me. 
21944 4 Great Product!!! Received promo code for a review!!! 
21945 4 Good for the price. ... easy to install 
21946 4 camera perfect 
21947 4 Performs as advertised. Very Satisfied. 
21948 4 My daughter loves it. She can share her pictures instantly with her friends. 
21949 3 works good. but made out of hard plastic. gopro floats 
21950 4 Nice price 
21951 4 as good as oem and cheap 
21952 0 Not good product. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. 
21953 4 Good lens hood. It makes a difference for my Camera 
21954 4 Great product 
21955 0 Broke within first use 
21956 4 Hi,i received your product.It s perfect and very convenience,thank you./. 
21957 0 This crap doesn t work! It s a scam! 
21958 4 Good used 
21959 3 Compact and fits the Cannon Powershot well. 
21960 4 Ok 
21961 4 Fantastic camera. I used it with the Olympus underwater housing and got really good pictures while diving. I also used it as a handy point and shoot while travelling around if I didn t want to pull out my SLR. Nice sharp clear pictures. 
21962 4 Perfect! 
21963 4 if went out 
21964 0 The color is not the best 
21965 4 Amazing flash for starters and pros. Couldnt be happier with this flash. Well built and amazing features. I wud go with the panasonic enloop battieries black battieries i have confirmed they are the best for this flash. 
21966 4 Great for my cine lens 
21967 4 Had it now for quite a while. I also have a bunch of Profoto gear and although its not as good quality wise it is great for the money. 
21968 4 Good item.Fits well. 
21969 2 Wish that I had been aware of the vector effect. More than likely, will seldom use 
21970 0 Worst microscope I ve ever bought. 
21971 4 If you own a D750, this is a must own. The batteries will last for multiple photo sessions or a long day of wedding shooting. The plus side is also that it helps balance the camera with larger lenses (ie 28-70 2.8). 
21972 4 This lens is now my new favorite lens. Very sharp and a great price! 
21973 2 great product. 
21974 4 Great price for a well built filter. 
21975 1 The sticky gizmo to adhere to the lens cap didn t stick for very long. 
21976 4 Love it! 
21977 4 THEY WORK PERFECT 
21978 4 There was a minor cosmetic issue with the case. I contacted the seller and they handled it in the best possible way. Thanks! 
21979 4 Great quality camera! Gives me a piece of mind when I m not at home. Highly recommended! 
21980 4 Works perfectly with my Hero 4 Silver. A must have GoPro accessory. I scratched the lens on accident and CamKix replaced the whole kit at no cost. 
21981 4 These batteries are working well. They appear to rival the stock batteries in runtime. The charger can be powered by AC or in a car cigarette lighter, which makes it super convenient. 
21982 4 Great! 
21983 4 It s what I needed. 
21984 4 Perfect case for traveling because of its compact size and brief case like handle. Organizing slots make it ideal to store accessories and extra batteries. 
21985 2 This is a good quality case, but it s too small to hold all my GoPro accessories. Glad I didn t order the small! 
21986 4 Many options with this kit! Love it all. 
21987 1 It doesn t fit the lens even though they had my camera listed. Be wary. 
21988 4 Great for multiple size lenses and even storing other gadgets and cords. 
21989 4 Perfect Tripod Ballhead! 
21990 4 I bought the go pro brand because it was designed specifically for the go pro. Im not a fan of the aftermarket stuff that will melt inside your camera and ruin it. 
21991 4 Excellent product I highly recommend it 
21992 4 Was as good as described 
21993 2 for every 10 shots, you may got 2-3 that don t develope well. doubt it s the lighting as i ve taken it in the same location. 
21994 3 This was a gift 
21995 4 Fast shipping, works great, made well! 
21996 4 Excellent 
21997 3 make sure you just get good lighting, or it might be fuzzy 
21998 4 Works! 
21999 3 Exactly what I want 
22000 0 Lasted about a year and died in a barely used safe. Prior factory battery lasted 4 years. Find another brand, this stuff is garbage. 
22001 4 Love love love this set! Tons of fun, and felt like I got my money s worth. 
22002 4 Excellent case - and very affordable. Best deal I have located for my camera. 
22003 4 Thank you very much! 
22004 4 Great buy 
22005 2 The clamp is as good as the GoPro one. However, the gooseneck is too long and wobbles more than the GoPro one. 
22006 4 This was my first security camera system purchase after extensive research. This is a great product that works right out of the box. The remote viewing devices connected via internet works perfectly after looking at the video instructions. I m am very impress with the clarity of the night vision. 
22007 3 Very sturdy and well built. Great buy. The only downside is that it has plastic knobs to crew the flash in. So far so good though. 
22008 2 Very nice no problem god for price 
22009 0 completely discontent control does not work ... not to do ... the product without control is completely useless 
22010 0 One of the packs did not even work. 
22011 4 Purchased 4 of these, no problems, adds additional indication of security 
22012 4 Exactly what I needed. Fit perfectly and clicked down. Lives on my camera now. 
22013 4 Good products 
22014 3 Works for my panasonic luminx zs21. Snug fit and not the easiest to use controls on camera, but functional and keeps my camera dry. No black ring around lens for this camera. Fits well. 
22015 0 This doesn t fit with the standard go pro mounts and other accessories. Almost ruined my case attaching it 
22016 4 Excellent value. Exactly what I wanted. 
22017 0 Doesn t fit 
22018 4 Great product. Holds all of my lenses. Fits in my camera bag with ease! 
22019 4 This is an awesome product specifically for transporting camera equipment. It is well padded with several compartments for lenses etc. 
22020 4 Worked will with some binoculars that were purchased. Great for a strap replacement. 
22021 4 Really nice product with amazing customer service, definitely recommend 
22022 4 Very sturdy. Perfect. 
22023 1 Junk; only used three times and then it stopped working. Lost receipt so couldn t do anything about it. :(( 
22024 4 1 battery for the DJI Phanton 2-3 is NEVER enough. You will want to buy a few of these. The are wonderful quality. 
22025 4 Works great. Thanks. MauistyleAloha.com, Sk8Maui.com TexasStyleSkateboarding.com 
22026 4 Excellent packaging. Arrived on time. No issues. Product is exactly what I was hoping for. 
22027 4 Super-Duper. But very spotty so I suggest you use a diffuser like the Micnova Gel Softbox with it, and you can change the color temp with the softbox too with the included gels. Battery lasts a very long time. 
22028 4 Fast shipping. Product as described 
22029 4 Quick charging times and also very compact. 
22030 4 Best camera for the price, pictures are clear and the camera is very easy to use. I do a lot of nature shots with moving animals and have had very good results. 
22031 3 Fantastic little lens for m4/3. I ve been using it for street photography as well as recording choreography and it s performed flawlessly for me so far. 
22032 4 good products! 
22033 4 Easy to set up and takes great quality videos. 
22034 3 The product is exactly what I was anticipating. 
22035 4 Best investment I ve made so far aside from my lenses and camera. 
22036 0 Waterproof case broke after one use. 
22037 4 It works well, but these Arlo accessories are a bit over priced in my opinion. 
22038 4 Does the trick and a doesn t break the bank. 
22039 4 Bought two additional camera s and they work exceptionally well. They are easy to install, great pictures on the unit. Very pleased and if you starting our on home surveillance, this a good starter product. 
22040 0 books are not lifesize, looks more like it belongs in a childrens playroom. not suitable for theater or adults. 
22041 4 Honestly, I love this camera so much. Easy to travel with .Burst photo mode, Wi-Fi capabilities is awesome! 
22042 4 Worked perfectly for the beach and keeping water out off my camera but I was too worried to submerge it under water to really test it. 
22043 0 Did not work 
22044 4 I own the plastic waterproof bag for a while, and I just found out there is a float strap that really makes my phone stay. I got one from UP Program as a free review sample. I have tried it, and it works. 
22045 4 Love this lens on all the different zoom levels. 
22046 4 Very nice size and easy to adjust the legs for great shots. 
22047 4 A little more user friendlier than the Sony - Sonys moreso for filmmakers. 
22048 4 Works perfectly and came a lot sooner than I expected. 
22049 4 Very good just a wee bit heavy 
22050 4 Protects my camera so well along with being very fancy. 
22051 2 I had to research this camera from other websites to get it figured out. the software is cryptic... trial and error Needs a 48 volt supply with a POE injector... Live and learn Still trying to figure out how to change the ip addresses... The manual is totally USELESS. 
22052 4 The Battery is exactly what I needed. It looked a little different, but it works great. 
22053 4 The camera and accessories have been great, as I worked for a small, weekly newspaper. I didn t need anything too sophisticated. Overall,it s nothing fancy and the bag s zipper gave out within the first month, but the equipment alone is worth the price. 
22054 4 Great Quality Product. Make the purchase, You ll be so glad you did:-) Very small unit but it packs a punch. 
22055 4 nice and it came all in boxes fresh new thing smell nice! recomends 
22056 4 Awesome Mount, it works perfectly. The build quality is Very good and it will definitely hold up to some wipeouts. 
22057 4 it works as stated except the Zoom for my Apple iPhone. I download the BT shutter App too but not working. Anyway i am not going to return it, as it is functioning good and also good part is charging last for many days. 
22058 4 Excellent combination of GoPro supplies. All mounts and screws came in as advertised. My only complaint is the extension pole is very loose and wobbly. I wouldn t feel comfortable jumping off anything with it. 
22059 4 good quality 
22060 0 Did not work at all. Cheap plastic not what I expected at all. 
22061 4 Great camera, and nice size, fits in my purse and takes clear pics. 
22062 4 These are awesome, they get really hot though, so I wonder if that hurts reliability... 
22063 3 I m pretty happy with this! Still getting used to focusing! When I look through the lense it s looks clear as I adjust my focus, but then when I look at pictures noticed blurry was (human error) really like it for the money! 
22064 4 They fitted perfectly to my video camera and are charging fine! Thank you! 
22065 4 Excellent 
22066 4 Fit perfectly, Fast shipping!!! Thanks 
22067 4 Arrived promptly, easy to set up. Just what I needed. 
22068 1 Objects were hazy and lacked sharp contrast. I compared with Orion Oiii. 
22069 4 Just right, excellent product. 
22070 4 OK 
22071 4 Love this lens. Very versatile and razor sharp. 
22072 4 works as advertised. 
22073 3 Even though used, it works well and I like it. Very pleased with supplier. 
22074 4 I would definitely buy this kit again. Great starter kit for people getting into photography. Only complaint is the tripod is pretty flimsy when fully extended. 
22075 4 Excellent product price-quality 
22076 4 Exactly as ordered. Enjoying immensely. Very happy with purchase. Few friends already looking at the same products for purchase. 
22077 4 these energizer batteries are just what I needed for my camera 
22078 4 fits great. 
22079 2 Wish I could actually use the auto focus 
22080 4 Fell in love with the strap as as soon as I took it out of the box. Build quality is comparable to non. This makes it so easy for me to carry my camera for long durations. Would recommend it to all.... 
22081 4 Love this 
22082 1 Does not fit a Sony RX100 but even if it did, I don t think I trust the velcro enough to keep my camera dry. 
22083 3 Nice pack. 
22084 4 Great portable device! 
22085 4 Great bag for a Sony a6000! Holds a camera body with a lens and at least 2-3 more lenses plus batteries, cards, etc. Great for travel! 
22086 4 All was perfect, 
22087 4 Exactly what I needed!! 
22088 4 The drone was as expected, easy to fly, hoping that DJI will be able to send updates that will allow us to program routes 
22089 4 Excelente 
22090 3 Looks so cute and love it already thanks 
22091 2 The lock knob on this head gets stuck to the point where I had to use pliers to get my camera off. Not great. 
22092 3 Easy install. I hope I won t need! 
22093 4 works great 
22094 4 Its an amazing product evryone should have one 
22095 0 Camera is not what I was looking for 
22096 3 Everything ok 
22097 1 Most of this is junk, but the filters and cleaner were usful. 
22098 3 Works great. However it does not support a 64GB card like the newer camera. Somewhat annoying. 
22099 2 Too expensive! Bought this and a 4 pack of the generic 52mm cap. Same quality as generic but you pay 4x more for this one. Lose yours? Buy a 4 pack genetic for the same price as this single cap. 
22100 1 Wished it was a bit more durable. Didn t see much difference between the shield and the plastic shield the camera came with. 
22101 3 Quality, yes. Overpriced, YES!!! 
22102 2 Works, but the straps are difficult to adjust properly. I m a fairly wide chested person, so even at it s max adjustment it is slightly uncomfortable. The camera itself sits at an angle and requires something underneath to align it if you want it level with the horizon. 
22103 4 exactly what i was shopping for. 
22104 1 Camera picture was blurry at best. Would not focus or zoom. Install search software provided totally locked up my router. Sent it back for replacement. 
22105 4 Excelente 
22106 4 Great Value! 
22107 4 very good, and very reasonably priced. 
22108 4 Solid mount, does the job as described. 
22109 4 Very good product, I really do not like the alarm noise it makes when you arm and disarm, there should be a softer sound at this point. 
22110 3 Just as described 
22111 4 Just &#34;installed&#34; them on my lenses...seem to fit and perform as advertised. Lets just see how they hold up. 
22112 4 Kenneth was extremely helpful in getting my camera set up to use the cloud service. Excellent customer service from the technical support line. 
22113 4 Taking to Argentina in November. This could be the perfect camera/all purpose bag. 
22114 3 Fine as expected 
22115 2 Not great quality 
22116 0 These are knockoffs and total junk. Avoid this seller. 
22117 3 It is good but every 3 min i rather keep steady videos without stop when i want to turn off 
22118 4 Great and good material 
22119 4 I m only using it for 35mm slides right now but so far so good. My only complaint is that it would be nice to choose a higher resolution. 
22120 4 This was awesome!!! I have the Handycam, but needed more battery time. This product allows me to charge alternative batteries, while using the batter attached to the Camera at the same time. Good idea, great purchase! 
22121 4 I needed something to store my sd and micro sd cards in and so i saw this and decided to try it out. I m glad that I did because this was exactly what I needed. I would definitely recommend to anyone 
22122 1 Good idea but the threads don t hold it steady for some reason. I should have sent it back when I had the chance.... 
22123 4 Great deal for all these. Now I have backup accessories and they work great! 
22124 1 Wi-Fi connexion between the camera and my cellphone or tablet is unstable. Not a reliable product, 
22125 4 5 star 
22126 3 Very good items. 
22127 4 Very nice Lens 
22128 4 Save lots of money buying this instead of Nikon brand and works just fine 
22129 4 Easy to use, loved the flip down lense cover on the bottom. I wish the eye covers did the same. 
22130 4 Easy to set up and does its job without a problem. 
22131 4 Great price. Arrived on time. Durable. 
22132 4 Fantastic bag! Great quality and delivered quickly! This bag is very roomy with more than enough room for my camera, lenses, batteries and charger! It is just what I needed and the shipping was quick and painless. Highly recommended seller! Don t hesitate if you like this bag! 
22133 4 Don t doubt on purchase this great camera!! It will surprise you! Excellente quality video, and the seller very effective 
22134 4 These are invaluable if you are using any stand outdoors. I placed my sand in plastic baggies prior to adding it to these bags and I have had absolutely no issues. 
22135 4 This is a needed item that is not included with D750 camera. 
22136 4 The Nikon ML-L3 Wireless remote control is small and very handy, and it works well with my Nikon D7000 as long as you point it straight at the indicator light on the camera. Great for self-portrait taking. No wires to deal with. 
22137 4 Like it very much takes great quality pic & video light weight and very user friendly 
22138 4 I m just a novice photographer, but this is exactly what I was looking for, and at the right price! 
22139 4 Every thing fits in real good 
22140 2 The filter is fine for protecting the lens but I see some ghosting and more flares when taking photos with the filter on. I believe when it comes to filters, it s a wise investment to get the higher quality glass to ensure you get the best photos possible. 
22141 3 Works great. As expected. No issues 
22142 0 I should have read the reviews before I even purchase I would have never gotten it in the first place for adapters like this I ll stick with the vivitar that I have on my 52mm 
22143 4 Perfect for all locations 
22144 4 excellent product. fast shipping. good company. will buy again. lisa 
22145 4 Great camera for the money. We have purchased several for use at our church. Quick shipping and no problems with any of them. 
22146 4 Work great! 
22147 4 Good day I received the camera case is very nice and meet my expectation thanks. 
22148 0 It really suck it doesn t work 
22149 4 Worked perfectly for my Nikon d3200 
22150 4 Amazing camera and arrived so fast! 
22151 4 Worked great for me 
22152 4 items delivered on time---everything was intact---nice little package items were exactly as shown/described 
22153 4 Good Deal! 
22154 0 Never held a charge from day 1. Guess its too late to return this paper-weight now, but trust me - this TRULY is GARBAGE - avoid - do NOT buy. IF the company reads this, YES I d like a REFUND. 
22155 4 Good 
22156 4 Very pleased... 
22157 4 A good product. 
22158 4 great product i like that it has the rubber not many others do 
22159 3 Not the best quality but not the worst. I ve had no issues so far with producing great background images in my videos. 
22160 4 Takes great pics 
22161 4 Very nice product. Worked like a charm on my Fuji xt1 and my Nikon d750. 
22162 4 Very nice 
22163 4 Good quality products at a fair price. It was shipped fast and I found all the products met or exceeded my expectations. I was able to mount my Action Cam to the handle bar of my Harley in just a few minutes. It works great! 
22164 4 Pelican cases are uniformly excellently made. They are extremely durable, and the latches simply work well. Enough said. 
22165 4 You won t regret buying. Great quality, perfect fit. 
22166 3 wonderful camera case even if small 
22167 3 Great Product 
22168 0 Doesn t work.. tried a few times. Better to buy the battery from somewhere else. 
22169 4 seems perfect as expected 
22170 4 Takes great pictures! We had fun with this in and out of the water on a recent Florida vacation. It is s little tough to see the screen in bright sunlight. 
22171 2 ok, so it s cool to have a video of 360.... But the image quality is seriously lacking..... Hopefully the next version is better because this one just sits in my drawer. 
22172 4 Just what I needed to keep my batteries charged. Great Product. 
22173 3 Works great 
22174 3 Great 
22175 4 The cameras worked out great at our wedding. They come with a note asking guests to take pictures. I loved it because I didn t have to create, print, and fold anything myself. 
22176 4 The best, light way and durable 
22177 4 good item 
22178 4 fits great to Leupold VX-3 1.5-5x20mm (30mm) - but honestly, could be less expensive 
22179 4 I love these glasses they r perfect I use the to drive and on my mini Segway 
22180 4 Love it! Works great with my selfie stick and my phone. The magnet also works like a charm. 
22181 4 Great little gadget for my son s GoPro at a very affordable price. 
22182 4 I m using this to fly FPV on my quadcopter. Had to modify the plug to fit my needs but it works great! 
22183 4 Perfect fit and perfect outcome! 
22184 4 Works perfectly I have had it installed and working since purchase and am considered purchasing another. 
22185 4 Very nice. As described. Quick delivery. 
22186 4 Great product. It will definitely float your camera. 
22187 4 Love the night vision recordings.its clear 
22188 4 This camera takes excellent images in almost all conditions! Even though I am experienced with manual SLR cameras, I just leave this one in automatic mode and the results are generally excellent, even for detailer product closeups. 
22189 1 At manual (M) setting the screen is smaller. I returned the camera. 
22190 4 Just what I ordered. The same as my other canisters. 
22191 4 Gave me a great range of new lenses to use. I started with the 25mm which came with my telescope, and was wishing i had more options. Glad i bought this kit. 
22192 3 This was a quick buy for my daughter and the product is easy to use. 
22193 2 Pretty nice but on closer inspection seems to be made out of cheap materials. I ll probably end up replacing this later but for the value it seems like it would be good for a beginner. 
22194 4 Works perfect and is a must when your traveling!! 
22195 4 Love the HFR on this camera as well as all the other features. Adobe already supports the RAW format as well which was a pleasant surprise. A powerful camera in many ways no doubt. 
22196 4 After reading all of the reviews, I bought the camera and it performs as advertised. You can t go wrong. Have people telling me wow what a nice camera and people commenting on how nice the pictures are. 
22197 4 a-ok 
22198 4 Love it. Much easier to align our 8&#34; Celestron SCT and more accurate than a red-dot finder. 
22199 4 Works as expected. No more splicing wires. 
22200 0 Parts were missing in the order. all I received were the batteries, no charger. I sent it back. 
22201 2 the camera is great....comes with NO manual! The case they sent does not hold the camera.....just the accessories. 
22202 4 Well made and very secure. 
22203 4 Excellent product. Gives me the ability to get very wide angle shots in home interiors. Great quality, certified OE lens from Canon 
22204 4 Works and fast shipping! 
22205 0 The clip fell off the first day I got it. Reattached it for a couple weeks then once it failed for good I was out of the return window. 
22206 4 Great camera 
22207 4 I am writing this Review regarding the excellent service I received from Dlink Support My Tech Referenced Service # AR004214 was able to help me correct my problem very efficiently and with excellent customer service I will purchase more products from DLink. 
22208 4 Great product, as described; something happenes with the delivery company, nothing that bad. Will buy again. 
22209 4 So cool, I take it with me everywhere 
22210 4 Filled my need nicely. Fast shipping. Reasonable cost! Works good! 
22211 4 Great product and buyer shipped quickly! Excellent experience! 
22212 4 I needed this. I have an older 17-35mm 2.8L It fits well, but does not come off too easily. I m fine with that... 
22213 4 My GOPRO been able to keep more secure. The storage space is also a very good product than many think. 
22214 3 Met expectations 
22215 4 work very well for the money 
22216 4 Great deal, seems like a great product so far. Haven t had a chance to extensively user it yet, but so far it s great! 
22217 4 Great product. Fits perfect in my hiking pack and very light weight. 
22218 4 We use these to capiture images of products coming down an assembly line using remote shutter switches. Does an awesome job. 
22219 3 sharp image. 
22220 1 All but ruined my camera lens filter - use with caution! I gave 2 stars because it does work well on my computer screen and iPhone. I haven t tried on the television - admittedly I am a bit hesitant to try on the 65&#34; screen. 
22221 4 This camera is really easy to use. It also take good quality pictures. Perfect for blogging or if you re just a novice photographer. 
22222 4 Perfect companion for my 3TB external drive. 
22223 4 One of the best lens filter I have ever used. Hoya is the best. Same with my Canon 24-70 lens too! :) 
22224 4 must have for go pros 
22225 4 Works exactly as expected. Simply set your camera to remote shutter setting and that s it. The only thing is that the sensor on my camera (canon T3i) is right in front of the camera. So I can only trigger the shutter when directly in front. 
22226 4 Nice product, great price and very fast shipping..!! A+ 
22227 0 Go back in the warehouse make another one Cause them thing no good I bought one about a two week ago When they sent it to me it don t even work. (A-szcxtop(tm) New Mini SPY Hd... A-szcxtop(TM) 
22228 4 Guardian advanced camera system is really good 
22229 4 amazing 
22230 4 Amazing piece of glass. Straight out of the box to a shoot. Impressive delivery time too. 
22231 1 No horizontal panning. View is a cone area below the device. Limited view. 
22232 4 Good product. Very reasonable price. I always look at this line when purchasing this type of equipment. Frank DiFalco 
22233 4 Came exactly as described and looks exactly as pictured. Works great. 
22234 4 Battery works great. I was told by other Nikon owners that some replacement batteries would not be recognized by the camera. This is not one of them. 
22235 4 It was a great deal. 
22236 3 Great 
22237 4 Strong and inexpensive 
22238 4 im happy to find that i could get batteries at such a great price. 
22239 2 Was dissapointed the illustration and text all lead you to belive it is an OEM Sony battery. So I ordered it only to find it is an aftermarket battery. Hope it performs adequately, Need to more transparent that this is not a Sony brand battery, but a non-Sony replacement. 
22240 3 It good. It was a little too big for my needs so I sewed the ends to make it a smaller diameter. If you need to do that, it s easy to do with these. Heck, you could probably make your own from some old drink koozies. 
22241 0 Broke 2nd week I used it. It was worthless. 
22242 4 Love the little pics my daughter takes with this camera. Great buy! 
22243 2 was good 
22244 0 It was stiff and would not telescope the way it was suppose to, so I ended up putting it back in the bag and return it. So unhappy, junk do not buy it ever. So mad, hate the product. $119 down the drain. 
22245 3 For the price very well worth it for my nikon d3000. It didn t hold a long charge for my event like my original battery; but I brought both batteries with me and it lasted all day. Very satisfied! 
22246 4 Items were as expected and were in excellent condition. Very happy! 
22247 4 Great product, durable plastic. The screw hole configuration worked with my Lorex LRD2152 Dome Cameras. I think all Lorex dome cameras all have the same whole pattern so they will most likely work with this. 
22248 0 The product was apparently defective upon arrival. It would never boot from day one although it was getting power. The item was returned for a refund. 
22249 4 I love it 
22250 4 great great great.. from the 1st shot I took I knew I loved this lens 
22251 4 First Post! A buddy of mine bought this Nikon Coolpix P600 and he swears by it so i purchased one. Shoots great. 
22252 4 Great item at a great price 
22253 4 Works effectively - as advertized. Battery life is significantly shortened by forcing it to wake up ever 4 to 5 minutes. But this is the only way to poll for current data on a regular basis. Consider a full-power USB connection for frequent polling. Otherwise a good product. 
22254 4 Excellent. Seems to work perfectly and is exactly as described. I am happy to be able to use my camera again after jamming the original lens. Thanks! 
22255 4 I had to call for technical support. Kenneth was able to solve my problem almost immediately. I rate both the service and product FOSCAM model FI8918W as five star. [[ASIN:B0046710G6 Foscam FI8918W Wireless/Wired Pan & Tilt IP/Network Camera with 8 Meter Night Vision and 3.6mm Lens (67° Viewing Angle)]] 
22256 4 Nice cameras 
22257 4 Great product- Thanks 
22258 4 Love these binoculars...very bright and easy to locate objects while being of a nice size and weight. 
22259 4 Love it 
22260 4 Very good 
22261 4 the ultimate beginner addon to the camera 
22262 4 Arrived on time. A sturdy product. 
22263 3 Works pretty well for the price. The side button has started to become less sensitive over a few months use. 
22264 3 Good 
22265 4 Awesome camera. Love the quality of the zoom. It s my 5th Panasonic and I m very impressed with this product. 
22266 4 Takes a little bit to install properly, but looks very nice and functions fine. 
22267 4 great item! 
22268 4 We order these every three months. Great quality and a must have for all of our electronics and glasses. 
22269 4 Got these for my father in law before a big motorcycle trip out west. They were simple enough for him to use as he is not very good with electronics. The videos and sound were clear. Great purchase! 
22270 3 works, but a little tricky to figure out 
22271 0 Expired film do not purchase 
22272 0 Unusable because it would just float off our wrists. 
22273 4 Great product. Love the new experience. 
22274 4 Solved a problem for me GREAT 
22275 0 Did not fit properly. Not worth dealing with for the price. 
22276 4 Holds 4 filters and protects them well 
22277 3 its a great lens sharp good color but for my hand it was to hard toget on and off. would like to have kept it .if I had an extra body I would have made it a real point and shoot. 
22278 3 Good as expected 
22279 4 Great camera 
22280 3 good! 
22281 1 Do not expect any tech support from this company (FunLux) so purchase at your own risk. 
22282 4 It looks good, but I have not used it yet. 
22283 4 Rating: 5 of 5 Product is as described. Works good. Very pleased. 
22284 4 My niece was so excited to receive this 
22285 4 love it 
22286 4 Fit like original. Very Satisfiled. 
22287 4 The batteries work perfectly with my Nikon camera and the battery charger has been a life saver on trips to charge my batteries on the go. 
22288 4 Works great! 
22289 3 Great product 
22290 4 Product was exactly as described. Product delivered on time. 
22291 4 Works as expected and reasonably priced 
22292 4 It focuses very quickly on my sister s 60D and allows you to get quite close to the subject if necessary. 
22293 3 It is exactly what I needed at a great price! 
22294 3 I really like the storage pouches, I wish they came in different configuration options for the 1690 case. 
22295 4 Fit perfectly and now I don t have to keep losing my lens covers! 
22296 4 Cut out is perfect. After I put it on and peeled off the &#34;second&#34; layer it was crystal clear and you can t even tell there s a protector on. 
22297 4 Awesome camera 
22298 2 Although support and firmware upgrades had to be cautiously followed, customer service with Terry Morgan was great help. Now I can use the camera, view via smart device, and login outside of the home anywhere. 
22299 0 Cameras started messing up after 6 months. 
22300 4 Just exactly like the OEM battery. I love how this has three slots to charge. Nothing else to say about this great product! 
22301 0 The pics and videos are in bad quality, it end up in the trash. save your money and do not pay it 
22302 4 Excellent product 
22303 4 Love this filter. It really makes difference in skies and landscape colors. Worth every penny spent!! 
22304 4 I have had only one opportunity to try out this lens so far. It performed much better than I had hoped it would. It is pretty compact and not very heavy. I look forward to having this lens with me in the future. 
22305 1 Don t last long short life! 
22306 4 So many attachments I will never use them all great deal 
22307 3 This fits my D5100 with Sigma 18-250mm with lens hood which is exactly what I wanted. The only down side is that you can t fit much else in the case, but that s the trade-off for a case this size. 
22308 4 I can t wait to use them. They will be useful when I can t my cheetah stands. 
22309 4 Best investment i have made for my business 
22310 4 They attach. They float the cameras. Not much else to ask of them. 
22311 3 Excellent 
22312 3 Very good quality... No instructions manual 
22313 4 very easy to set up !!!! quality of the camera is a 10 !!!!! 
22314 4 Great product! I ve used this floaty handle a bunch while swimming and kayaking. I really feel better about not losing my go pro. 
22315 4 Works great makes flying more enjoyable. 
22316 3 Yes it works great and it was easy to install 
22317 4 Excellent lens 
22318 4 Decent quality camera. Love the feature of ability to move the camera from my iPhone. Great night shot. Sometimes the auto mode does not work and the day and night mode have to be changed manually. Good value for indoor security monitoring. 
22319 3 The case is large enough for the camera and some accessories 
22320 4 Yes, it s overpriced but it s small, rugged and very adjustable. I don t mind paying a little more for obvious quality. 
22321 4 Very good camera 
22322 4 fits great! makes my d3000 much more comfortable to hold. 
22323 4 Picture is sharp with good definition. It gives a good screen resolution.Excellent camera for the price. 
22324 0 I ordered the 50mm and recieved the 52mm, thought it was my mistake until I checked the order. Found out it has happened to others as well. This is not just frustrating it s unprofessional. 
22325 4 Perfect for occasional use! 
22326 4 Great battery pack. I use them on my hero 3. I haven t done any testing as to the length of charge time, but they do just as well as my regular gopro battery. 
22327 4 This is a great product with many useful features! I love it! 
22328 4 The quality of this tripod is on point. So hard to believe I paid so little for it. 
22329 0 was really expecting a stand/legs and a light bulb holder as pictured in the product photograph. I did not receive this. sick. 
22330 4 Nice camera 
22331 4 excellent 
22332 4 Works great for what we need it for. 
22333 4 Purchased these stands a few times. I have been very happy with them. Sturdy and high quality. 
22334 3 I m still working on learning how to use the camera, but love the photos so far! 
22335 2 Doesn t work for viewing on a Mac. Also had issues getting this to view under the newest version of Chrome on Windows. Tech support was fantastic but decided to return and purchase one that works with a Mac. 
22336 0 There is no mirror surface on this mirror - I removed the protective coating and it hardly reflected my face -- a waste 
22337 4 Yup great 
22338 4 Awesome!!!! 
22339 2 This case was very cute, but it was only &#34;okay&#34; when it came to protection. The plastic casing cracked and allowed my phone to constantly fall out, there for it only got used for a couple of weeks. 
22340 4 Great item price and fast shipping 
22341 4 Love them 
22342 4 Great accessories kit for the Go-Pro. My husband absolutely loves it all. 
22343 4 Excellent product. Bought as a replacement and re-charges battery 3-4 times quicker. 
22344 4 A must have for time lapse shooting and astrophotography... 
22345 4 Love it. Superb pictures. 
22346 0 When putting mk 4 in, a bit of the back snapped off, extremely unhappy. Applied almost no force when putting in and completely snapped. Also the lack of battery access is infuriating. 
22347 2 Not the best battery life. For someone who does a lot of filming, I need something a little stronger. 
22348 4 So so it s k would buy again 
22349 4 great 
22350 4 As described 
22351 4 Excellent tech support 
22352 3 So far, so good. 
22353 3 worked fine. 
22354 4 Works well for small cameras 
22355 4 Great Camera!!!! 
22356 3 Love the system Works great i instslled it myself I do wish i had an instruction manual I still dont undestand the dvr completely 
22357 4 Highly Recommended! 
22358 0 At first it seemed to work well, but it would lose connection randomly causing the camera to power down and causing me to lose my shot many times. Maybe mine was just a lemon, but I returned it and I m getting the Sony version instead. 
22359 4 On time, and super cute! I m in love! 
22360 4 Really enjoying this bag. Fits so much of my equipment 
22361 3 It s a bit difficult to figure out how to use at the beginning but once you figure it out it works perfectly! My Yongnou YN-560 IV and this pair up perfectly! 
22362 4 I use this all the time. Works very well. 
22363 3 Works very well. I have only used it for home movies so far. It works better than the mic on my Canon T4i. 
22364 4 These worked sooo much better than the straps that came w the waterproof cameras! ! 
22365 3 Only thing mildly confusing is that the LEDs and battery slots aren t oriented in any way you can remember which is which. 
22366 1 does print pics but some come out with streaks 
22367 4 Does the job. Love it so far. 
22368 0 Only one of the 4 cables worked 
22369 4 i bought camera at flea market with no charger. not knowing it even worked. gave 6 bucks 4 camera. bought kastar battery and charger kit and the camera works like a new one. right on kastar!!!!! 
22370 4 Great item 
22371 4 Excellent product! I was imagining something more simple and not so good, turns out that is an amazing camera with all benefits is a semi professional one! Love it! 
22372 4 Very cool! 
22373 1 Camera works great, but iPhone software is garbage. Alerts never work properly and their monthly/yearly service plans are wayyyy too expensive, considering what they re providing. This device has become almost useless to me. 
22374 0 In my opinion, it is just more crap to waste your money on, not to mention all the wasted time and work it takes to install it. 
22375 4 Love this product! So affordable but great quality. Great service. 
22376 4 Love it! 
22377 3 Its really pretty and a great strap, I just wasn t enthused by the rubbery grip on the back side of it. 
22378 4 This flash is astounding! It zooms the flash when you zoom your lens and has a built in diffuser as well. I highly recommend this product to photographers any photographer that s on a budget or just getting started. 
22379 3 Convenience and compact 
22380 4 Works great made money with it ready!!! 
22381 2 Flimsy 
22382 4 hot mikes and paranoid. Plus, my work has Skype/Lync and some people have been known to turn on their computer camera and sometimes they are not were they should be or wearing the appropriate attire. LOL! Ooopppsss - 
22383 0 The battery is not new, exactly like the rest of the reviews say. Don t buy this product. It does not hold a charge for more than half an hour. 
22384 4 Fit fine. Did the job! 
22385 4 Very good Camera. 
22386 4 Great kit and seller 
22387 4 Great product. 
22388 0 Actually a very high quality camera, however, the hardware used to attach the camera to equipment is not sturdy at all. I had the camera mounted on my wind surfboard and it came off and I lost it in the ocean. 
22389 2 I have just begun using it. The back screen scratches very easily and I have not found the wire to download pictures into the computer from the camera. It does not seem to come with the camera. 
22390 2 Good, however a close lens is much better. 
22391 4 These are great, but I ll never need them since I never crash! Also all my code compiles first try. 
22392 2 The mouse never worked ( I had to use an old mouse of mine) The remote works SOMETIMES. Also some remote buttons do NOT work at all So I guess I give it a 7 out of 10 
22393 4 Great 
22394 2 Great value. 
22395 4 Very well designed and built. Definitely improves handling of the camera. 
22396 4 They last longer than my original Canon lithium battery. 
22397 4 Excelente 
22398 4 This works perfectly. 
22399 4 Excelent product, economizer of energy, sensor of motion! 
22400 1 Too small..go with a large size one..can t put all your accessories in it 
22401 1 Wrong battery. Connecting pins were male instead of female. Completely useless to me. Description was incomplete. I gambled and lost. 
22402 4 excellent product, very good quality, as expected. very responsible seller 
22403 4 Great Product great price 
22404 4 Love this handycam. I got the bundle which is definitely benefical with all it contains. Tripod looks flipsy. Having had need to use it. 
22405 3 works great thanks 
22406 4 Wonderful, easy solution at an affordable price! I thought my camera was broken! Now it charges up and works perfectly again! 
22407 4 jiust love it 
22408 4 Got everything 
22409 4 Bought this for my orange loving son s first camera. He s dropped it twice (that I know of) and the camera is still perfect. Nice little case! 
22410 4 The color is nice and uniform. The paper is a decent weight and is reasonably durable. The packaging was very good. The photo qualities of the paper are very good and perform well with flash. 
22411 4 Great for traveling. Fits in a pocket and has good quality images. 
22412 4 Great deal 
22413 4 Works very well, and is so simple to use. You can use it with cable or with remote. 
22414 4 It holds up the roll of paper I bought it to hold up. I ll be moving it to a new location temporarily next week. 
22415 4 This camera & bundle is awesome for the price. This camera does not allow a wireless remote, so the bundle didn t include the remote, even though it was listed in the description. 
22416 4 Great camera 
22417 4 Reasonably priced, items as described, arrived when promised. Seller recommended. 
22418 4 Product arrived on schedule. Worked perfectly 
22419 4 Excellent 
22420 3 Added fun for my daughter and her friends!!! 
22421 2 Does the job in a pinch and is highly portable. I have used it with point and shoot cameras as well as a DSLR. Just make sure you distribute the weight properly when using a heavier camera. Basic physics! 
22422 3 Just got a set and tested them out. Seems to work fine. 
22423 4 This was perfect for a grad party photo booth! 
22424 3 Good product. Does what it should. 
22425 0 broke within 2 months junk 
22426 1 Well great at the beginning. I think i will be buying new. The lens is not working as well. I have to get it sent in for repair. The images are blury past the 100mm range bummer 
22427 4 Battery was not lasting on our camera and felt time to replace the battery. Well what better was than to get 2 batteries and charger. Can t beat the price. Everythign works great! 
22428 4 As expected! 
22429 4 If you are tried of not being able to see the image your trying to photograph, then this is the one for you. Heads-up, the image in the viewfinder will appear a little out of focus but, doesn t effect the shot. 
22430 3 Smooth transaction. A+++. Thanks you!!! 
22431 4 i love it!! great fit..i will give 5 stars 
22432 4 Fine 
22433 2 Hard to focus and hold steady. 
22434 4 This is an awesome tripod. Itbis really easy to set up and use. I am going to get a lot of use from it. 
22435 3 gooddd 
22436 1 This is a cheap tripod. The head adapter screw broke almost immediately. The panning and tilting of the head is jaggy. Unless you are setting this tripod to a single position for photography, it is pretty useless. 
22437 3 A little tricky to fold/coil up, but decent. 
22438 4 Nice carry bag. Use it all the time. Sometimes switch it with the Sony camera holster but for most travels love this bag. 
22439 4 good product, arrived on time as promised. 
22440 4 For what this is and what it cost this is the best lens you can buy for the money. It added more fun to photography. 
22441 4 Better than expected. Perfect gift for the girlfriend. 
22442 4 The pictures are clear and accurate per the subject being filmed! Only wish the pictures were larger, but I ll still order more. Really like having an &#34;instant&#34; photo in seconds! 
22443 4 Works great in my Panasonic FZ150. Have used the same one in the FZ150 for a year now and have no issues. It sees the charge level, etc. 
22444 3 A little flimsy and no markings on the filters, but creates fantastic photos! 
22445 4 Grate 
22446 4 Works as you would expect it to for a reasonable price 
22447 4 This is the simplest thing. It straps on very easily. It s easy to put on and take off. It s one of those million dollar ideas, and it comes at a great prices. 
22448 3 Some of the accessories I didn t need. And the gorilla tripod cracked almost instantly. Other than that, I felt it was a great deal. 
22449 4 Works just as advertised. Got it quickly and it works great! 
22450 3 The batteries don t last quite as long as the factory original, but the price sure is right. 
22451 4 bien 
22452 4 Live this lens!!! It s perfect for the everyday lens to sporting events. The package was secure and the shopping was fast. I definitely digest this lens. 
22453 4 As I needed for my project 
22454 4 Great 
22455 4 This is my 2nd Syma X5C. This is one tough drone! It has crashed several times and keeps going strong. 
22456 4 love it 
22457 4 Awesome quad, have had several weeks and no crashes or flyaways. Really nice product for the cost. Someone forgot to put manual in box before shipping but found everything on line. 
22458 4 Great on time 
22459 2 the camera mount is a bit stiff and hard to aim. 
22460 3 Love it ! Bought it from here at a perfect price I was a little doubtful but it s definitely worth it. Love it perfect for my hands and love the flip screen 
22461 3 Exactly what I needed to use the ! Most Excellent ! camera as a video tool. Probably got one with the original purchase, but did not know what it was for. 
22462 4 These are awesome, I love the different designs!! 
22463 4 I have always wanted a gopro and not that I have one I love it! A great buy! 
22464 4 I got into collecting old cameras to shoot film in and part of the fun for me is doing some restoration. I have used this lens sucker for picking up tiny lenses out of assemblies and works as it is supposed to. Very handy tool to have. 
22465 4 Located a Sony digital camera in a flea market. Did not wish to keep camera plugged in all the time to charge the battery. Works great! 
22466 0 My camera constantly stay off line. I file a complaint to the company and they did sent a replacement cord for free, but I still having problems. I paid too much for this camera for it not to work properly. I brought this camera to watch my property. 
22467 4 Easy to install compared to other IP cameras I have owned, comes much better software. Very wide angle lens, picture is sharp with excellent color. Excellent night vision. Would definitely buy again or recommend to a friend. 
22468 4 Excellent product I highly recommend it 
22469 4 Love the quick release function. High quality 
22470 4 Important when you need more juice 
22471 4 Good price and an absolute must have on your camera. 
22472 4 The film arrived on time. Great price! I am really enjoying my Instax Printer! My family & friends get a kick out of these tiny pictures, also. 
22473 3 It s a very neat design. A little better instruction would have been nice. But I like the double use of the tripod and converting it to monopod so easily ! 
22474 0 Item is NOT white as listed in description, the cable is NOT RG59 as listed in the description. It is Siamese and 25 foot as described. 
22475 4 Setup and use is SUPER simple! Love it! You will too! Anybody can enjoy this camera and you can set it to go on when you leave the house 
22476 4 Great product and shipped fast. 
22477 4 Works good 
22478 4 I always loved this camera. I got another one to replace one that had broken. Despite its small pixel size, it takes great pictures. 
22479 4 Love it! Perfect tripod for me and my point and shoot camera. 
22480 0 Not good. The camera appeared to be repacked and it did not perform correctly. The POE feature did not work and had to returned it. 
22481 4 Really great camera for the price. Fast shipping. 
22482 4 Excellent unit optically and mechanically, not what you would expect at the price point. Highly recommended! 
22483 2 Good lens. 
22484 4 Exactly what I paid for. Love it 
22485 4 Excellent I love it 
22486 4 works great 
22487 2 ok 
22488 4 Works great. Allows for better sound. Not for use in foul weather or where waterproof case is required. 
22489 4 Excelent. Like the original battery for my Alpha 77 II !!!! 
22490 4 took great shots ove them 
22491 4 I love my selfie stick, I use it all the time,wherever.Same exact quality as the name brand at half the price.Highly and affordable.Very satisfied! 
22492 4 Great quality and build! I have used it a lot and it feels OEM! Fit and finish are top notch. For the money its a great buy! 
22493 4 Great Product 
22494 1 This tripod is very small and lightweight, however, also very flimsy. I tried to fix it in position but it barely holds. The weight of my compact camera makes it shift and slowly collapse, certainly not what I expected. this is not a quality product. 
22495 4 Fit camera perfect and just like new. Super 
22496 4 A great price on a great case. Fits a 1911 well. Very strong plastic, just like the whole Pelican line. 
22497 0 Was great when it worked.... only ever sat in my bag and the light inside blew out after only using it 7 times (if that). Owning it for alittle over a month, Dealer said &#34;nothing he can do...&#34; Buy a 400x scope from someone else... 
22498 4 :) 
22499 4 Bon produit et livraison rapide 
22500 0 I could never peal off the film just broke 
22501 4 Great props, they are an original DJI product. Exactly the same as the ones that come originally with the phantom 3. Each pair arrived in a black fabric bag same as the one that comes with the phantom. 
22502 4 Perfect! 
22503 4 Work perfectly Thanks! 
22504 4 Good addition to the 800TVL camera installation. 
22505 4 Not only does it protect my gopro and accessories, but it keeps them organised and ready to go. Its great not only for traveling, but also is a great storage solution in general. 
22506 3 Great results. Well designed. But the instructions are poor. For example, the black coil that is seen in the view of the receiver. I assume it is the antenna, but no information is included. Can I lift it vertically and extend it? Duh. 
22507 4 Perfect quality product! 
22508 4 Great Deal. 
22509 2 It s okay but not the best.... 
22510 4 Excellent product 
22511 4 Nice upgrade to my system 
22512 4 I m really liking these AmazonBasics items. Very cheap and quality-made. I will continue to buy from Amazon. 
22513 4 One of the greatest digital camera Sony has to offer. It has good specs and the image quality is good too. 
22514 4 Great case. Perfect fit. Like the pocket that I can use for a spare battery. 
22515 4 This is the cord I couldn t find so I got another. It s working great. Love it. 
22516 4 Great product, great service. Works perfectly. 
22517 3 The UV lens sometimes shows circle crystals in the picture when its too sunny 
22518 4 a 
22519 0 Worked for a couple of months. Then stopped wortking. Company would not honor worrenty 
22520 3 This camera is very easy to operate and works extremely well. I would recommend it. 
22521 4 A great piece of gear if you shoot in bright light. Use this on my Nikkor 70-300mm VR zoom lens on the beach and at sporting events and it really eliminates that &#34;washed out&#34; look. 
22522 4 LOVE this cute little camera & I ve owned several Canons, but they keep adding features & I love the wide-angle on this one!!! 
22523 4 Good battery that last three times as long as the factory battery, defiantly worth the buy!!! 
22524 4 Thank you 
22525 3 Good value. The case does not have a pocket for the extra battery and memory cards. 
22526 4 Exactly what I have been needing, highly portable, has own case. I love using this product. 
22527 3 It s not rock solid, and there is a few degrees of play in the head with the large Canon 100-400L lens attached, but it works and for the price it s very much better than the alternatives. Light and compact when folded. 
22528 2 Not as easy to focus as I thought it would be 
22529 4 So far this is my favorite lens for the micro four thirds system. 
22530 4 Excellent!,,Thank you 
22531 3 This unit if the fundamental starter for anyone who likes video &#34;on the go&#34;. It works well, takes clear images and sound. I haven t tested it underwater yet, but the tightly sealed case seems well built and solid; likely to work fine in wet/underwater conditions. 
22532 4 good and is very good in travel 
22533 3 good 
22534 3 Just right 
22535 4 Tough as a tank, plenty of space for my gear. 
22536 4 great 
22537 4 A wonderful piece of equipment. Still learning how to use it; much to learn. 
22538 4 very good price 
22539 3 Love the car adapter as many times we forget to charge the battery before we leave for something. Works perfectly with our cannon battery. No problems with it and it was a good price. 
22540 4 Excelente 
22541 4 A++++++++Highly Recommend 
22542 3 Holds the camera firmly in place Very good product 
22543 4 Very nice to use 
22544 4 Great Camera! 
22545 4 Cool thing! 
22546 4 Works really fine on my Canon 6D love it!!! 
22547 4 no complaints just wish it had an external mic jack 
22548 4 Good 
22549 3 I had a ND filter stuck on my 18-55 for months and this got it off in 5 seconds. Takes a little patience to align properly but it will take the filter right off. 
22550 2 As expected.. but not real detail on how to use. One of the items came broken. 
22551 4 Great 
22552 3 Works great and fits the Canon Camera. 
22553 0 This product is not worth the time. It came blurry a waste of money and I can t retrieve back because it came from out of the country. Please please please please don t waste your money. Sign Disappointed.!!!!! 
22554 3 Has lights to indicate power or surge(helpful during installation) 
22555 4 LEDs started burning up shortly after first use on my Nikon digital camera 
22556 4 Awesome assortment of tec stuff for the one who is starting! 
22557 4 Great pics,great packet value 
22558 4 Good 
22559 2 ok 
22560 4 thank you ever so much! 
22561 0 You can only stream video to your phone if you re on the same wifi. 
22562 1 NO SOUND ,NO BUY 
22563 4 Well worth the small investment to protect a large investment in camera and lens equipment. I hope I never need it but it s there when I really do. 
22564 4 looks great and takes great pictures 
22565 4 I actually took the foam insert out and use it to store fragile items (eg. Micro 4/3 lens) and it s really great for that. 
22566 3 Loved the attachments hated the ion air pro. Returned the action cam and kept the kit to use with another action cam. I hope I m making sense, but yeah. Good, really good. 
22567 3 Charger works good. Only issue I have is that it hardly holds the battery in place which can be a problem if you re charging in the car/on the go. 
22568 4 Fits like a glove. 
22569 4 It fits all my stuff. And it I don t carry my laptop then I put other papers in it. The memory card holder is secure. It s comfortable to wear. 
22570 1 Crashed each time I tried to install my SD cards. Uses a lot of broadband. Requires Flash in browsers. The picture was pretty good, but I couldn t deal with the other problems. Returning. 
22571 4 Excellent 
22572 4 Great price for legit equipment. It s amazing how much more you get in a shot with a 10mm versus 18mm. I m loving this lens and all of the extra goodies for not much extra are worth the small investment. 
22573 4 But this Light meter, Great for perfect flash! 
22574 4 It is a very profesional look article that helps a lot, for the price, I don t regret it at all, 
22575 3 Not user friendly, but I love a challenge. All the parts work fine. Hopefully I won t lose them. 
22576 4 Love this bag! Fits my Manfrotto with pistol grip no problem! Thanks! 
22577 0 Item arrived without mounting hardware or instructions. 
22578 4 Love this! So fun! 
22579 4 It works great with my ADT Safewatch Pro 3000. However setting the thing up with it was an absolute bear. Not the fault of the device. A fault with a ridiculously complex system for pairing it with the ADT equipment. 
22580 3 Way too much $$$ for this s***. 
22581 4 they work great!! very easy to work and set up!! Thanks Dan!! 
22582 4 A nice case but had to return because I returned the camera. 
22583 4 Love this camera and the telephoto lens. The lighter weight makes it perfect. I had a Canon years ago so the learning curve has been pretty easy. 
22584 4 This item allows me not only to see pictures on a bigger screen but also make me look like i spent a lot of cash to make my dslr different. 
22585 4 It was perfect just what I had expected. 
22586 3 Sony 28-2 is bright and clear for general purpose photography. But the images it produce, is nothing magical like the Leica Q with Summilux 28-1.7. Even at A7R2 s 42 megapixel, the images aren t as detailed as the Leica Q. 
22587 4 excelente producto recomendado 
22588 3 Had to place it on a stationary camera, it moves to much when trying to adjust the dim switch. 
22589 1 The issue is, that some of the screws that come with the prop guard don t fit. They aren t long enough and I can t get them to tighten the guard. So, I left the guard off the Phantom, which is not what I wanted. 
22590 4 excellent buy 
22591 0 Pictures did not develope well. Waste of money 
22592 3 good for what it is 
22593 4 bought it for my husband; he loves it; he s a bit taller than 6 feet so he prefer a very tall tripod and this is one I found on Amazon and very good price 
22594 0 Horrible! This is a gray market market (which means it s not from the U.S.) Nikon refuses to fix these camera if anything happens to them. I am very disappointed. 
22595 3 Good product.... 
22596 4 Love my GoPro. Made some great YouTube videos at beach and water park. 
22597 2 ok 
22598 4 Works and good price 
22599 4 Bought this for my Nikon 1 J4. It fits everything and then some! My camera, extra lens, battery charger, cables, extra memory cards all fit and I still have more space for other things. 
22600 4 Henry was very helpful in setting up my camera. I would recommend the Foscam cameras ! 
22601 0 This product was awful. Directions in English were poorly translated. Had to watch a you tube video and it looks like the guy could only make it work after he took it apart and jerry-rigged it. I threw mine away. 
22602 4 Cheap for all the pictures I got:) came in fast love them!!:) 
22603 4 Good carrying case that fits my Olympus SH-2 well. The extra pocket is useful for the tripod shoe, but not much else. Smaller items like spare SD cards or batteries would likely fall out. 
22604 4 Well-designed product. Fit perfectly and excellent quality 
22605 0 Horrible item. Broke within 2 weeks of occasional light use. Lost the $70 digital camera I just purchased in the river because this did not hold up at all. Very disappointing! Do not buy. 
22606 3 Worked well. 
22607 4 Good item and good price for it. 
22608 4 A good cheap wireless remote for the DSLRs. I used it for Canon 7D m2 and works very well. 
22609 4 The selfie stick works great. I even used it in the pool. The straps are great and I never have to worry about losing the camera. 
22610 0 Horrible. It worked 2 times. I went to use it again today, and it quit working. What a waste of money!!! 
22611 0 Junk---didn t work very long... 
22612 4 Great kit and great service :) 
22613 4 Great tripod! Thanks. 
22614 4 Yes, this is a great arm to attach my digital recorder to my video tripod, nice and solid. 
22615 0 This will not work for swann security system like advertised. I bought eight of these and they are junk. 4 didn t work at all. And 4 worked for a couple minutes. So I have 8 cords that I can t use. Do not buy. 
22616 4 A must for this camera !!! to make it truly bomb prof, not the prettiest thing but does the job. 
22617 4 Works great, no problems what so ever. Exactly like the battery that came with my camera. 
22618 4 Works absolutely amazing I have no complaints 
22619 4 Works very goodl. Delivers one time. 
22620 4 loved the different colors. so cute 
22621 4 very pleased! Good price on a great item! 
22622 4 I use the GoPole almost every time I use my GoPro. It is definitely a great accessory to have if you enjoy traveling and doing action sports. 
22623 4 Meets my expectations. A perfect size for days when. Don t need all my equipment. 
22624 4 Good to take along an extra eyecup when traveling since the Olympus eye cup tends to come off and disappear easily. 
22625 4 Nicely padded. Keeps my lenses safe! 
22626 2 The Lens was fairly OK but the out of body was more used than indicated. (faded) 
22627 4 It s a great camera, but the instructions are very básic 
22628 4 a 
22629 4 it to cool 
22630 4 Great camera and great value with the bundle. 
22631 4 Henry was very professional and gave great tech support. Thank you Henry !!!! 
22632 4 Works great on my canon 70d. So much better than a neck strap. No issues so far. Does not block the flip out screen. 
22633 4 Awesome Camera .... We love it. We own 2 other Sony Alpha that we use in our family photography business. The results are superb even with the kit lens. But with the ability to use FE and adapted lenses, you can get some mind blowing results from this camera. 
22634 2 found it to be too small to be very useful I bought and exclusively use the backpack from amazon: [[ASIN:B002VPE1WK AmazonBasics Backpack for SLR/DSLR Cameras and Accessories - Black]] 
22635 4 Very happy with this purchase, interesting design 
22636 4 Worked perfectly! 
22637 4 Literally fits like a GLOVE, very nice! 
22638 3 No comments 
22639 2 works as advertized and cheap 
22640 4 Literally no complaints. better than I expected! 
22641 0 dont work 
22642 3 This worked out great for my cannon. It s wasn t the exact charger I got for my cannon but it does the job. 
22643 4 Great lens for the money! Takes sharp pics over entire focal length. 
22644 4 Excellent for carrying my phantom 3 proffesional 
22645 4 Works great compact size fits on my backpack perfect 
22646 4 I love my vivitar battery and charger kit for my Sony NEX 5R camera. It works great and I received the items promptly. 
22647 4 The package arrived in time for my granddaughter s birthday. It was her birthday gift. She loved it.She took photos of her birthday party with it and everyone enjoyed the camera. 
22648 4 I Love It! Great Camera! 
22649 2 For the price, it is a very interesting lens. Personally, I don t have a lot of use for it, but it does have a very nice open aperture. 
22650 4 Very nice, the price was well worth it, in fact if bought separately I would have paid more than triple the price. Everything was nicely packed and I feel it was one of my best purchases I made for myself in awhile. 
22651 4 It s just what I wanted, pictures are sharp, it s easy to operate and its lightweight! 
22652 4 Excellent quality recommended seller 
22653 4 they work great 
22654 4 Worked on my Eviant 7&#34; TV - very happy. 
22655 2 it will do but it comes all folded up and looks completely fake. I will see how it photographs but doesn t look real at all. Very digital. 
22656 4 Love it 
22657 4 excellent! 
22658 3 Keeps the full batteries coming I love this tool. 
22659 4 Amazing item, delivered earlier than expected. The clap and goose neck are ver sturdy and made with good material, worth the buy to any one who wants to get great static vids with their gopro. 
22660 4 Definitely great for the price and gets the job done. Straps look pretty durable and I am sure with time and being out in the sun they will eventually break, but for the price I d replace them again in a heartbeat.Tested on variable length and prime lenses. 
22661 4 This is a very nice and comfortable wrist strap for those who do not like to use their neck straps! 
22662 4 May not be the most expensive glass out there, but this I ve never been disappointed in any HOYA product. True, I m not a professional, but I take care of my stuff ant HOYA works for me! 
22663 4 FAST DELIVERY&#62;&#62; wow! 
22664 3 Installed in minutes to replace an old sony system in my Monaco RV. Works good. 
22665 4 It does exactly what it needs to do. after hours of searching for cameras I found this one. it was very easy to install and the picture is very clear. If your making a decision, MUST BUY THESE CAMERAS. 
22666 2 resolution is not adjustable. remote didnot work OTB. 
22667 4 Works great. 
22668 2 ok 
22669 4 After several trys I finally found what I wanted. 
22670 3 Camera bag is very small. Everything else is about what you d expect for the price. 
22671 4 Love this camera but rather intimidated by all it can do. Not a beginner s camera! Will have to buy a book D3200 dummies book to be able to use it. 
22672 4 Exactly the same as the one I lost but easier to obtain and cheaper. 
22673 3 works good 
22674 4 Good camera. Clear picture. 
22675 4 Great value. 
22676 4 Great buy on good film! 
22677 4 LensPen always delivers! This one is much smaller than the previous model. Although I don t really like new curved design (I am a straight lines guy), but it does the job perfectly, as always! 
22678 4 Works great. 
22679 3 Works a treat. 
22680 4 Excellent, sturdy base. This thing is a rock. All the machining is beautifully precise. The head is very nice for still photography but too stiff for video. I mounted an inexpensive fluid head on the base and I m very happy. 
22681 3 Have taken some pretty awesome photos with this film it never fails me! 
22682 4 Works Great. 
22683 2 Kind of delicate. 
22684 4 I only needed one of these in my GoPro camera cases on my dive trip for 16 dives. I am careful with my cameras and this was extra insurance. I had no fogging at all. I inserted them just below the camera after i placed the camera in the case. 
22685 4 I ve been using it for 2 weeks, and i love it. I would buy this again, as well as recomend it to friends. 
22686 0 not real eos bag,smelling too much and too small to hold dslr 
22687 4 Great price Amazing quality 
22688 4 Item as described 
22689 4 Love this camera. I m still trying to figure out the basics of photography. Once I get those down pat, I m going to really love it! 
22690 3 I ran a mud run with this and it stayed very secure. I think the top strap helps keep the camera from flopping around as much but I wasn t able to tighten it as much as I would have liked. Great product for the price though. 
22691 4 works great; timely and well padded shipping; would buy again 
22692 4 it exceeded my expectations. Great light, easy to use and very economical. Already suggested it to few artists friends of mine. 
22693 2 Lightweight and thus does not hold to the windshield very well. I love the picture and clarity=-colors are terrific. 
22694 1 Quality is what you d expect from this price point and size, and is acceptable. But the battery lasted for only two short uses before it wouldn t hold a charge. 
22695 4 High quality and will buy again. This was able to fit all my DSLR and GoPro items in one place. Now I just need to grab the pack and go. 
22696 4 I love it I use in my strobe lite and my speedlite. 
22697 3 LOOKS LIKE THE REAL CAMERAS , GOOD VALUE 
22698 4 A+++++ fast shipping product as described. 
22699 2 wooks

22701 4 Not bad for that money. 
22702 4 The are really high quality accessories for your camera. I have purchased several and am quite happy with them. 
22703 4 Worked great on our family vacation to Hawaii. My husband recorded our entire trip from start to finish with his fancy usie stick and Go Pro. We ended up with a really cool video of our trip. Great little pole mount. 
22704 4 I ve lost several microfiber cloths in the past so this 6-pack is great for having extras when needed. I like that they come individually wrapped and it cleans my glasses perfectly. I m very happy with it. 
22705 4 Great camera case! Lots of storage spaces. 
22706 4 perfect student camera! 
22707 4 Very nice gear. Part of the collection of accessories to have if you are a photographer. Loved the price, weight and features, hard to beat for the money.

22720 4 Great 
22721 4 Recommend!!!!!!!! 
22722 4 Item as described and arrived quickly. 
22723 4 The oversize version of the eyecup works exceptionally well with eyeglass wearers. Shuts out distracting light, esp. on sunny days. 
22724 4 This is the 1st tripod I ve ever bought. I am very happy with it - easy to carry around easy to get the camera on easy to change the height. 
22725 4 High quality. 
22726 4 Lost the original cord to my Sony and this came super fast and was exactly what I needed! 
22727 3 I just bought this bag for my DSLR and initially it looks great, feels comfortable, is light weight etc. The only thing that is missing is the bottom pocket for a monopod and an integrated rain cover. That s why I m giving it 4 stars. 
22728 4 Works perfectly, just what I needed 
22729 4 Such great quality picture on this thing. Love it!!! 
22730 4 Kenneth, my customer service technician was terrific. He got my up and running in 5 minutes and the camera is working great now. 
22731 4 Like it hope it lasts as long as my last one did 
22732 2 Zippers are really cheap and 1 out of 2 broke. Still worth using with 1 zipper. 
22733 0 Not compatible with Genie garage door motor. 
22734 4 Very satisfied 
22735 4 Works as it should. 
22736 4 nice 
22737 0 Not usable due to its a new product and not recognized by softwear...since only support is in JAPAN it is impossible to get help. Do not buy!! 
22738 4 This camera is perfect for our young photographer 
22739 4 It is what it is. Used it for GoPro 4 black and my Shoei RF-1200. Works. 
22740 4 The camera is a good fit for our need and I like the recording quality of the footage. 
22741 4 enjoy the way it develops picture 
22742 4 It is a good product, and not expensive. 
22743 1 I ordered just the bar mount and it is huge. I don t even know what bar it would go around. It is definitely not what is pictured. 
22744 4 Excellent range; easy to install and the inside alarm is loud enough to hear over dogs, children and TV! 
22745 4 My son gets so much use out of it. Makes me wonder how I got by as a kid with the crappy technology we had. 
22746 4 work great got to me fast! 
22747 4 Works great and doesn t cost nearly what the Canon branded product did. 
22748 4 As shown! Met my expectations. An all-around good buy!
