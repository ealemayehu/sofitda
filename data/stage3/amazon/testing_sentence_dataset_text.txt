22880 Cheap, the plastic inside that holds the ink so when you turn it it ll come out - came broke. So I cant even use it as a pen. The camera points way high so it doesnt even work if you have it in your shirt pocket. 
22881 Great product. Did what I needed it to do. Just wish the cameras would adjust the zoom. There to close 
22882 very very cool!!! 
22883 Flys and takes video great, but you cant take it over 500 ft. The older ones you could take well over 1k feet. 
22884 My favorite mount now, can be angled just about any direction you will need. Quality is good. 
22885 So disappointed. The pictures weren t high quality. And it was so smart, but I couldn t figure out how to sync everything. I quickly gave up and went back to using my phone for everything. 
22886 Lens works great! For its price it s definitely worth the money. 
22887 Good price. I wouldn t check it on an airline but it s good for taking the drone places. 
22888 Its hard to find anything when not on the plate but overall a great little scope. 
22889 Very nice basic lens hood 
22890 This is the second one of these we bought. Gave our &#34;pro-sumer&#34; camera much better audio capability. Beware! The 1/8th inch audio in is mono. Using this unit you can input two XLR lines into a camera with only 1/8th in stereo input. And you can balance them during operation. 
22891 It is awesome! I love this camera! I use it all the time! 
22892 It s a go light product. The name and product speaks for itself self 
22893 To short creeps down the lens. Needs a rubber type material on inside to grip lens barrel so it will stay put. It is built good but doesn t stay on. 
22894 Henry was very helpful. he not only fixed my issue buy did resolve some issues i was having on my pc aswell. very knowledgeable on the product, very happy with company. thanks Henry 
22895 Great camera. Great price. 
22896 Lights are ok. But the rest of the kit is complete garbage. You get less than what you pay for, you re better off investing in a higher quality built light tent than this kit. 
22897 Very happy with my camera package! The only thing that bummed me was i received the case with the zipper jumped off track and doesn t close in the corners. But that s why the front clips are great! VERY happy. 
22898 After losing lens cap I now know the importance of using one, the lens cap fits perfectly. The sticky thing is supposed to stick to the cap - good luck with that. 
22899 Very flimsy and not supportive 
22900 Poor quality video .Hard to load onto computer. 
22901 Bought for my sisters birthday/moving away present! She loves it! 
22902 Love it! It is sturdy enough for a phone. If extended, fully, i would just take care not to bump it. It is light weight aluminum. Still...a great product, for the price. 
22903 Great buy it looks and feels original and fits my lens perfectly this is a 67mm lens cap I use for my 18-140 nikon lens. 
22904 Very handy to have without carrying extra pieces of equipment. 
22905 Awesome product. i always get great quality when i buy Tiffen 
22906 Very nice as a camera bag and room for a wallet. 
22907 Works great!!! 
22908 Fit perfectly! 
22909 does nothing it says it does 
22910 Ok 
22911 Works as expected 
22912 This package has so many stuff that there are so some accessories that I don t even know what they re for. 
22913 Great product at such a discounted price. Fits snug around my GoPro 4 Black Edition and still provides easy access to ports & SD card. 
22914 Excellent value! 
22915 I Love this camera. It works so nice. This camera video quality amazing. It is perfect camera for video. 
22916 Awesome value for the money. Light, sturdy enough for basic photography. 
22917 Setup was easy (once the wires were run). Great resolution for this price point and the Android app is pretty good. Only negative is that the mouse that came with the DVR requires a lot of force to click the buttons. 
22918 Very comfortable and looks great too! 
22919 Great! Works well and will come in handy for so many situations. 
22920 Had one before - lost it and thought enough of the performance and fun to buy a replacement of the same product 
22921 Great product 
22922 Works perfectly in my video camera. 
22923 They work great. Cons: Not enough range for my application, but they work well. They Need to come with power adapters, they use a LOT of batteries. 
22924 included battery lasted about 3 hours, functions ok with new $7 battery 
22925 Works Great for making porno s 
22926 These fit perfectly, went on easily.. I don t know how well they hold up, but unless they re a total disaster, they re a great buy. 
22927 Works well for CCTV cams 
22928 came home from outing and the package(CAMERA)was sitting outside my door!it was worth the wait. Mahalo for your persistence and tenacity! mahalo nui loa!!!! rty. 
22929 Works great on Canon lenses. The attachment string is also long enough for a zoom lens mounted on the caner. 
22930 I Love my Nikon 810 camera. Clear images..and can handle dark areas with high ISO. I am a photographer and use it everyday. 
22931 Do not buy this item. Did not work as described or at all, in fact. 
22932 Works how it should, high quality! 
22933 Literally perfect 
22934 Good 
22935 The Phantom 3 is awesome! Check this out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LW509QAZH6o&feature=youtu.be 
22936 Good! Easy installation and setup, reasonable price, nice pix. 
22937 i wouldn t trust the reviews of an amazon purchase for a 3K camera, but i love it. 
22938 should have bought OEM unit - name brand...you get what you pay for - if you only look at price then its a good unit 
22939 great products. Thanks 
22940 Fits perfect 
22941 The product arrived on schedule, charged in my Canon charger, fits the camera and appears to be as advertised. I will be using it to have a second battery during an upcoming vacation. 
22942 lots of fun ways to use GoPro 
22943 Fits perfectfly with the GoPro Hero 4 Black. 
22944 Fits well, does what it s supposed to do. 
22945 Better Than Expected 
22946 Very good 
22947 camera will not hold a charge but the film paper is fine 
22948 cool camera. only thing is doesn t come with film. you have to buy it separately 
22949 okay material, but good for the price. 
22950 82-77mm step down adapter does not fit the Tamron 70-200 f/2.8 which is 77mm. 
22951 These cloths are just what I was looking for. They are not thin cloths, there s weight to them. I love how large they are especially when cleaning my eyeglasses. I highly recommend these. 
22952 For the price, a pretty good camera. Surprisingly good night vision for single IR led. 
22953 Great. Arrived as promisef 
22954 I m not going to lie, i was disappointed that the Blue wasn t like the picture! It s a lot darker but haven t had the pleasure in really using the Tripod but so far it seems really sturdy 
22955 This is a pretty great little product here! It is strong and sturdy. I use it with a canon rebel and it works perfectly. 
22956 Nice fit, slim profile 
22957 its perfect, super cute and fits camera nicely, it will surely protect it 
22958 Need to know how to really work it.... 
22959 Pretty well, is what I wanted. Fits perfect in my manfrotto shoulder brace. The chapest and confidence image stabilizer ever 
22960 its better than original canon 
22961 Could not get it to work. 
22962 Vincent was an expert at getting my cameras to show on my phones. He took the time to explain everything perfectly! Thank you! 
22963 This is made very well, and has a quick set up design that is extremely secure... 
22964 Love this tripod. Purchased it to use with my Nikon Camera and Im very content with it. 
22965 eyepiece set is good.. need to add a barlow and some other parts in the case. 
22966 Love this camera. It s great for someone like me who needs to rely on the autofocus feature. The zoom is powerful and takes clear shots. 
22967 They work fine. Very happy with them 
22968 Lags & it sucks. 
22969 I bought this kit for my daughter s Nikon D50 camera. It worked perfectly while she was a way at Photography camp and every time since. 
22970 Waste of money. Will fall off at the slightest movement. Should have purchased the Nikon hood. 
22971 It works for my use, not as a piece of camera parts. 
22972 Great quality product. 
22973 Too short of a chord. REturned 
22974 mediocore 
22975 Everything fits perfect, no complaints. 
22976 Great camera, FOSCAM remote installer, Walter took care of business right away. The whole set up was about 5 minutes. 
22977 worked perfectly 
22978 I think this kit is very good. Has most options that you would use though I tend to use the 18-140mm most of all. I have changed the filters to the better but the one provided are reasonable. 
22979 just as described. 
22980 Sturdy, no issues and has all pieces to easily use with your GoPro. Love it! 
22981 Bought to store my ultra light fishing reels. Works just fine as I expected, no more worries when traveling. 
22982 Love it!!! I also love that it comes with a strap 
22983 Effective. Work great. 
22984 I ve used these for years. Best generic battery out there 
22985 easy to use 
22986 Works as described. Great value. 
22987 I love it 
22988 small but works well 
22989 I am SHOCKED at how well thay work for the money! I have a old canon rebel that gets no respect and they did a great job on a filthy sensor. 
22990 good capacity, good delivery 
22991 works well 
22992 Works great 
22993 Excelent product! 
22994 Does what it s suppose to do... Wish it was easier to install and uninstall without using tools.. but not bad. 
22995 I love this battery!! Easy to understand what s going on, holds charge well, and charges my full size Asus ultrabook to about 100% once with a full charge - all I need. So far, it never got uncomfortably warm either. Now I *never* have to stop working! Oh, wait... 
22996 Great selection for my camera! 
22997 Awesome batteries. I get over 5 hours of recording time on my Canon Vixia HF M41 with one battery. The car charger is a great addition to my kit. Probably a dozen cycles on one of the batteries so far and I m getting full charges quickly. Great package. 
22998 Everything works well. 
22999 Since I got my GoPro 4, I ve bought quite a few filters & junk. Out of everything this is one of my favorites! 
23000 Much sturdy than the plastic one I had before. Three level adjusting legs can make it very tall. I haven t figure out how to use the reverse function. But it fits all my needs now. I m happy with it. 
23001 Good price to scare off thief who try to break into your house. 
23002 Just perfect! 
23003 This camera is so cute and so good! 
23004 Perfect condition. 
23005 Got the camera to keep tabs on the animals while we re out and it works fantastic. It was very easy to set up on my Android phone and the video quality is very good. 
23006 Great value for the price. Purchased as a gift so wanted to load some photos onto product before giving. Found the remote a little unresponsive at times. Picture quality and display vary depending on quality of original data loaded onto frame. 
23007 Well almost everything is good, it just the 4 spliter adaptor is not working only if i bend it , i don t know why. Thanks 
23008 I bought this career to remote control my dog when I m not at home. It works perfectly. easy to apply and the quality of pics are great!! highly recommend!! 
23009 these are great for the buck 
23010 worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks. 
23011 great 
23012 Can be a little hard to view the screen in bright sunlight even when screen is set to its brightest.. 
23013 So many options! Going to take some time to learn to use it. 
23014 Exactly as advertised!!! Quick shipment+++ 
23015 Love this bag! 
23016 Great product! I have it on my front porch and I have the base hooked up about 100ft away in my shop. Yes, there is the occasional false alarm, but not often. Has lasted 2 winters and 2 summers in the South. 
23017 Good 
23018 Love it! 
23019 terrific 
23020 Great price and product arrive perfectly. 
23021 The sound isn t the best 
23022 It doesn t work for canon, i didn t realize. Trigger should do its job when it s not attached to the camera, but it doesn t. I guess it works for nikon though. 
23023 Great product! Used it for a trip to Costa Rica and it was awesome. I d definitely recommend this product and seller :) 
23024 does not work. Can only get red light after 4 hours of charging and inserting an sd mini card. Could not do any recording and computer does not recognize the glasses as the instruction say. 
23025 I attached it on my Dicapac WP-ONE Point & Shoot Digital Camera Waterproof Case with Canon powershot S95. It was perfect for snorkeling. I love it! 
23026 Had to return it. I bough it for my wedding and all the images came blurry. The quality is appalling. 
23027 It works flawless without network drops. Excellent video Quality 
23028 Cannot be beat for the price. 
23029 I purchased these for my iPad, but can use them for so many things! 
23030 Connected it with my dvr, it has sharp image at day and at night. Good experience. 
23031 After 1 and a half year of use, 5 cameras dont work anymore. They were profesionally wired and indoors. 
23032 Not original 
23033 Being able to handle a picture to each person really made the photo booth a success 
23034 Very good 
23035 works fine 
23036 Perfect sized bag and cush enough for my Nikon D3300 and extras 
23037 Excellent..... and very prompt devilery 
23038 This is awesome. I wanted to be able to take pictures while in New York without having to hand my several hundred dollar camera to a pickpocket or thief. This allowed me to take pictures and remember my trip without having to bring someone else or have my camera stolen. 
23039 Perfect 
23040 Used once and it cant charge anymore.....became trash.. sigh... 
23041 great condition , very clear optics 
23042 I left this case on the back of my truck and when I drove off it fell off onto the highway. It got run over and I went back to check it out and he case did its job. My gopro is perfectly fine 
23043 I now always have a spare. Reasonable price. 
23044 Perfect and just what I needed for my camera!!! 
23045 Thank you, very happy with the management of purchase - sale. 
23046 i have worn this pin to work once a week for the past year & I wash it in the laundry. It hasn t lost its color & is still as cute as ever. Highly recommend! 
23047 This camera takes a few pictures and then the lens gets stuck and says lens error, no wonder it was so cheap! 
23048 Battery works fine. I use it as a back up and have not tested the battery life. 
23049 Fit GPS, seems to work properly. 
23050 Perfect item worx great THNX 
23051 Works great, all my fd lens work well with it so far 
23052 I love this flash, helps me take great pics! 
23053 Smart Majic in Photo and Video Technology 
23054 Great film! 
23055 Item delivered on time and as described. 
23056 The pack rocks, I have purchased 2 more and- 2- 360 light units at 72 years old I no longer have a desire to carry heavy light sets and stands. Everything goes into one rolling case stands,lights,boxes, brellas,etc cables, and packs. everything I need 
23057 Looks real enough, but the batteries on the larger cameras wear out quickly! 
23058 I first received the wrong product, was completely disappointed. Immediately, returned it. Received the correct product quickly (in time for my trip) and am VERY happy. Great quality bag! It is awesome for what I need! 
23059 Awesome little cloths! got the for my touch screen laptop to remove finger prints and it works great! started using one for my phone too and it keeps it looking clean 
23060 Works straight out of the box with both my Canon 430EX II and Vivitar s 285V s. 
23061 Pretty decent close up lens and exceptional value. I find it works best by selecting one of the three parts, maybe two, but haven t found a need for all 3 in combination yet, if that s even possible. 
23062 Love love love this tripod. It s light and still sturdy. I use this almost every day. I have a Droid Turbo and it holds it nicely and the remote works perfectly with it. I highly recommend this product. 
23063 Worked perfect it was great using my camera again after so long 
23064 If it had the Wi-Fi camera and longer lasting batteries, I would consider it perfect. 
23065 I was missing the bolt for the micro macro lens could not fit the adapter on 
23066 works good 
23067 The Table Top shooting cube is fine but the four backgrounds were folded into 6&#34; squares that are difficult to impossible to get rid of the folds. The really should roll them up. 
23068 Like others, my only complaint is that you could place the battery in backwards. Not sure if that s an issue, the charger might have reverse polarity protection? Batteries work well, charger works well. 
23069 Cute :) 
23070 Exceeded my expectations. I ve been using everything for several months and.no problems. Glad I saved money and didn t buy the gopro kits for 3x the price. 
23071 Great replacement charger. Works fine and does a fine job. 
23072 Works well and solidly built. 
23073 Henry :did an outstanding job helping me set up my F19821W camera for both wireless operation & remote access. I am very pleased with the customer service and the camera. 
23074 Great alternative to the comparable Nikon lens for a fraction of the cost. It s a bit noisy, but that doesn t bother me. 
23075 dvr does not give signal to LG monitor. cable is good.but does not operate. when turn on zmodo logo appear that says loading, then turn black with wording no signal., cannot get help from support. 
23076 Worked exactly how it is suppose to. I was kind of scared because of such a low price, but it worked like a charm! 
23077 Film wasn t developing properly or not at all. Film may have been too old. 
23078 I hope my gopro never falls off in the ocean, but at least I now know it ll be up on the surface when I go looking for it. 
23079 A+ 
23080 Does what it says on the box 
23081 Works great 
23082 Excellent product! provides great visibility while protecting copter from noob damage. Installation tip, lay thick towel on flat service and flip copter without props. This will keep all your motors in alignment. 
23083 The back protector works great however the top screen protector does not fit perfect since it is flat and the screen on the camera is a little rounded. 
23084 Gets the job done without any hastle. I love being able to use my gopro on a tripod. 
23085 It charges the batteries fine, but have not used the camera enough to need extra batteries yet. 
23086 Absolutely what I wanted! 
23087 nice compact camera with hight Mega pixels 
23088 Met my needs and expectations and the price was really good. 
23089 Camera is fantastic and the package was a great deal. Recommend! 
23090 Great 
23091 Great camera for summer fun! Works well underwater and outdoors. Very durable. ..it has survived many water slides and works perfectly (even after being dropped a few times by my child). 
23092 The little camera that could! Great, crisp picture. The only downside is the talking feature. It is so quiet my dogs can barely hear me when I talk through it! 
23093 It does what it s supposed to do. Installed on Nikon D750. 
23094 Pictures are not big enough, I bought the 300 wide two weeks later 
23095 Great camera, consistent 
23096 Good 
23097 Very blurry and slow. 
23098 The perfect flash backup. I shoot Nikon and use a Nikon SB-910. I needed more flash units for off camera use and this product works great with my Nikon system. Will most likely order more so I have plenty. 
23099 works very well. shipped quick and I am very pleased with the quality and construction. 
23100 Not as easy to program as hope. 
23101 These are just wonderful. With the border s finish, they don t leave any lints hanging. The simili-suede just grabs dust and lint and doesn t smear like tome cheaper cloths. Great value that I highly recommend. 
23102 Quality Nikon product at a good price 
23103 More than I expected. Thanks 
23104 The camera was all that was advertised. Took me a bit to figure out all the gadgets that came with it, but I did. Camera takes very high quality photos. I am very pleased with my purchase. 
23105 Great item, great price, quick delivery. 
23106 Lost my original one so this one will fasten on to the strap., 
23107 works perfect. battery charge status shows up. 
23108 great 
23109 Works great has a great range 
23110 Excellent product. Thanks! 
23111 works as advertised good customer support. 
23112 Can t usually get it to stay straight so the flash actually hits the softbox correctly. 
23113 great fit and finish, no complaints here 
23114 It meets my needs 
23115 I just got into the hobby, and didn t want to spend a lot of money on eyepiece s just yet. This was the right upgrade for me! 
23116 I purchased these cleaning cloths based on previous reviews and I do not regret! Great quality and good value! 
23117 It s okay, but not in love with GoPro style mounts in general. 
23118 Just received the camera. Took just a couple of pictures and I am very pleased. At first I found it a little hard to center the pictures but I think I am getting the hang of it now. Bonnie 
23119 It s great.. and I m sure that it s amazing. 
23120 Thank you for getting it here on time. See you guys soon. 
23121 Purchased the RFN-4s for my Nikon D800 fitting was easy to fit and worked straight from the box. Would thoroughly recommend this product. 
23122 FOR THE PRICE NOT BAD !! 
23123 Yes, I like this camera, its perfect for my real estate work. Good quality, and my 2nd Coolpix. 
23124 Have had the camera for 1 week and am amazed at the quality of the images. Have hand held low light images at 720mm equivalent and gotten clear sharp images, wow! Other low light images have been equally impressive. I suspect that I will never use the flash. 
23125 Great lens 
23126 This is my favorite 2x3 instant camera, only surpassed by the Fuji Instax 300 for the picture size. 
23127 Shipped fast and item works as stated. I like the compact design. Easy to fold up and carry along for a shoot. 
23128 I never got the darn thing to work. I didn t return it either because it was cheaply priced and not worth the hassle. 
23129 Wonderful cleaning cloths. Great company. Would buy again. 
23130 Very good product and good picture quality 
23131 One of the batteries came with defect and it doesn t hold the charge... 
23132 Came in on time. Was able to charge the camera before going see the baby thanks. 
23133 The tripod itself was great but the quick release came broken I can t put the plate back on. Now I have to by a whole new ball head. The price to ship it back is just to much hassle. 
23134 Not good 
23135 Great entry level camera. Decent quality. I love having it for off-road and rally cross races. I wish the battery life was a little better, but since it can record while charging, I just leave it hooked up in the car. 
23136 great product thank you 
23137 Little bit of a tight fit, also don t try to remove it from the case its very hard to get back in. The case fits my Hero 4 Silver great but the rubber with most 3rd party cases is thicker and harder to close. But overall great. 
23138 Pelican quality always. Sold on quality and long lasting. We use about 20 cases with our equipt. 
23139 Fits like a charm. Exactly what I needed when mine fell off my Canon XSi. 
23140 Worked great on my camera very happy 
23141 Great novelty gift. Don t expect clear digital quality pics however. Fun camera to take to parties and gatherings. 
23142 Very nice price. 
23143 Great product...most others have a short range, but I have tried this one at 140 feet and it still works! 
23144 Good 
23145 Fits well and works with the metering system (aperture priority) of the camera. However, I don t understand why the camera (Fuji) side is plastic and the lens side metal. Other adapters have metal on both sides. Can t they match metal to Fuli X mounts? Curious. 
23146 Zmodo makes the best camera system on the market for the money. I ve had several of these models for many years. 
23147 Good for the price. However you can t see pictures outside because of the sun glare on the screen. 
23148 the flash is not Polaroid as in the picture, the filters lens aren t filters, just 4 diferent close-up lens.. everything else was cool.. 
23149 Great 
23150 Was a replacement for one that stopped working. 
23151 seems to work fine...a little tight fitting 
23152 Did not work but it may be a problem with laptop and not the charger purchased. Have not determined yet. Arrived fine and no problem with transaction though 
23153 Worked great 
23154 I m not sure the one I got is a Watson. It doesn t say Watson anywhere and just looks like a cheap fuji ripoff. It seems to work okay and fit for now. 
23155 good yes!!!!!!!!!! 
23156 A very nice, very functional, full featured camera, in a compact package. A keeper! 
23157 It works great to activate shutter and video record but their is no option to adjust shutter, iso or aperture so you still have to touch your camera even when you have this remote. I wish it had all the functionalists. 
23158 Decent cams. Very easy to install. Had to return, one s night vision stopped working after 2.5 wks. You can only view day time. 
23159 Not working @ all..not even 30 days & now I have 2 return it. 
23160 Works great! 
23161 Fine product, not sure how good this glass is but it works and my pics look a lot crispier and warm and I get to show the awesome blue Florida and Puerto Rican skies and puffy clouds. 
23162 The Vivitar Dual Action Lightning and Motion is a great devise for shooting lightning during the night. Needs some practice to figure out the sensitivity adjustments. Thanks Amazon for your awesome service and promptitiude as well as you did many times for me. 
23163 Ordered extra batteries for my new camera. Arrived quickly and work perfect. Thank you. 
23164 good 
23165 Does what it s made for 
23166 You get whet you pay for, so this works fine at this price. 
23167 Finally I can store all my camera stuff in one place!! this is a very nice bag with lots of room for my &#34;stuff&#34;, and it arranges nicely with compartment dividers that are movable. 
23168 Fun for a party. Film was fresh and easy to use. Great picture quality. 
23169 The Rokinon Cine Series are a great value. Perfect for the low to mid-budget filmmaker. 
23170 The first picture got stuck and ruined in both cartridges. 
23171 Great product & service 
23172 Description matched product. Was a perfect fit for our overhead projector. 
23173 Not the item pictured! This is a single pocket wizard for Einstein mono lights only. I should have read the description. 
23174 This is the best camera I ever owned. Makes you wonder why hauling a massive camera makes any sense. Seems stupid now that I have this one. Let s see the death of massive SLR cameras! 
23175 you get what you pay... 
23176 I absolutely love this quadcopter. My main use for it is photography and the turtle mode allows for slow and predictable movement. 
23177 One sided, off centered. Not as described. There are many other sellers selling much better straps for the same price 
23178 not for dslrs rigged or with heavy lenses, may need some fiddling or twiking to make it reliable ! 
23179 Like it and recommend for those who doesn t have a studio flashes 
23180 Great Camera. I have given up on my big DSLR cameras. I make big 16X20 or 16X24 inch prints and they are great. 
23181 Love this viewfinder, just wish it worked with my new GH4. 
23182 Works great with Pisector GS08 console. I lost my original one and was able to connect this one to my system in a matter of minutes. Pisector customer service is always really responsive and helpful if you have questions about compatibility with their systems, sensors, remotes, etc. 
23183 Complete Garbage 
23184 Terrible camera shaky video grainy I bought two and I m sorry threw away the boxes or I would have sent them back not even close to my go pro 
23185 one battery has lasted for a few months already in my dog s bark collar, with no sign of slowing down yet 
23186 I like the quality of this tripod. Not plastic like other moderately priced tripods. I especially like the ease of adjustments and love that it can be close to ground level as I enjoy photographing snowflakes. 
23187 Needed storage for my memory and I have always liked this memory holder. 
23188 very good 
23189 I m so pleased with the product and the speedily delivery! Great doing business with, I highly recommend! 
23190 Very user friendly. Excellent color. Like it much better than my canon. 
23191 not usefull 
23192 This product is excellent value I am very pleased with it. There are lots of pieces in this kit including several cloths, lens cleaning fluid and tissue, a blower and brushes. Did a nice job cleaning my camera lenses and filters. Best value hands down. 
23193 It fit in the charger but would not power up my camera. 
23194 It s nice quality but I thought it was a longer pole. I should of paid better attention when I ordered it. 
23195 Just what we wanted. 
23196 great product and have bought again based on good performance 
23197 Terrible Product. Not stable at all. 
23198 good 
23199 Excellent product 
23200 I read lots of reviews before ordering this. I hooked it up and took some shots at home right away and it worked great, comes in a nice carrying case also. Will work great for catch light. 
23201 Great viewing and quality for the price. Very happy with the binoculars! Use it for the horse track and watching birds. 
23202 Works great. Even fits over my life jacket when I used it on the water 
23203 Worked as advertised. Took the scare away from those snorkeling trips over deep reefs where I previously worried about losing my $400 camera. Also got some cool video in a lake by letting it float upside down by itself and get visits from the resident fish. 
23204 GREAT CAMERA! 
23205 Just what I needed! 
23206 one of the best gadget so far! thank you for your great customer service! appreciate it 
23207 Love this! 
23208 Awesome product my nephew absolutely loves it! Excellent value and high quality made. 
23209 Good lens 
23210 Doesn t work with Applie PC 
23211 The product good value for money. Although it needs a faster net connection, it works average on standard speed. Image quality fair 
23212 Motion detection alarm a bit complex to set. 
23213 Love this case keep all my essential accessories in one place and super portable very strong 
23214 worked great with D3200, allows you to set interval and or duration. 
23215 They re microfiber cloths, what s there to review? 
23216 These are fantastic. I ve used other microfiber screen cleaning cloths before, but these are amazingly better. 
23217 I love it. 
23218 Used this flash for one shoot--then it died. Was hoping for more out of this product. Usually I don t have issues with this brand. 
23219 It was great 
23220 Great picture quality with this lens. 
23221 The product was received in very good time, I think it was a day early. Packaging was very appropriate and no complaints about the product as it was exactly as expected. 
23222 Perfect to fix stripped tripod mount 
23223 Excellent product!!! AAA fast delivery! 
23224 Everything was perfect! 
23225 Everything I expected it to be! 
23226 Excellent lens, 5 years warranty, great for my Nikon cameras. 
23227 KAZA filters are excellent choices and have a great price. I look forward to using this filter on my Canon lens. 
23228 Très bon 
23229 This is exactly what I needed for a camera that was given to me. I can now use this excellent camera because I now have the right charger. 
23230 Great deal! 
23231 the camera is great shot so fast unlike eny other camera at that price, the bundel is a real added valeu, thogh it wood be nice if there are 2 extra battery because the camera consume the energy quite fast 
23232 Did the trick ..fixed our lens with the help of youtube and a fraction of the cost of taking it in. 
23233 I ve taken some great shots with this, couldn t be happier. 
23234 This is a perfect travel lens. It has a very large range, but is relatively light weight. 
23235 Certainly worth the money, I recommend it! 
23236 I use this a a portable Chromakey system and it works great. With two people, it s easy to lean against the wall. With a little practice, folding goes smoothly. 
23237 Very nice. Might buy another one. Very quick and easy set up. Added a nice soft light to photos. 
23238 It was nice 
23239 Nice group of accessories, don t know if I will use them all, but it will be cheaper in the end than purchasing separately. 
23240 Used this (in my fanny pack) my whole 2 week Disney stay and it was nice and compact and light but hard enough that I knew my camera was safe. 
23241 For $20, this microphone is phenomenal. I can play ukulele while recording my own voice and even sound distribution is given to both. 
23242 Perfect for street photography and to take on vacations. I didn t use any of my other lenses on my last trip to NYC. Very lightweight and portable, it doesn t draw any attention. Silent and fast focus. Very pleased. 
23243 Once I learned to use it I love it. 
23244 Price and quality were both excellent. 
23245 Perfect flash, never failed and doesn t cost an arm and leg like the other named branded flashes 
23246 Works Great 
23247 great battery 
23248 Haven t used this a ton but it seems really good quality and it is nice that the whole camera holding assembly moves on the strap 
23249 Very good 
23250 Held battery life to expectation, isn t too heavy, does the job. It ll do. 
23251 Match the body of my camera! 
23252 No RGB values for color squares. No PDF of manual. 
23253 I toss it into my backpack every time I go hiking and never have to worry about my filters getting scratched or lost. 
23254 Good, inexpensive! 
23255 It works as advertised 
23256 Dropped connection, can t get it back 
23257 Great price, fit s my Manfrotto Heads perfectly. 
23258 Background is very thin, so keep that in mind. 
23259 Nice and durable 
23260 Works perfectly. Great picture transmission. Simple setup. I ve ordered 2 more for other rooms. 
23261 This is a great product. It is small compact easy for travel. The company TrioSports USA is a wonderful company to do business with. Excellent product and customer service I would recommend this product to my friends. Thank you 
23262 Great for the Microscope and great for science kids! 
23263 It came on time only 10 days love my pics😄 
23264 Great camera, now if I can learn all its finer points! Turns out it s the same one my grandsons bought after extensive research, so it must be good! 
23265 Easy setup, quite versitile. Using it to make photos of old family pictures. 
23266 I like it and am enjoying it for the purpose I bought this for... I ll be back for more, it works amazingly well! 
23267 Should have read the specs closer. Only takes high resolution pics. Cannot change setting for smaller file sizes. Crazy in the day and age that this feature is not included. I have a 15 year old Sony that does it. Otherwise it s a decent camera. 
23268 This is in use everyday. I put it in my garage because I normally leave the overhead door open. Now I know when a person enters the garage from in the house. 
23269 I bought this for my daughter s 16th birthday and she loves it. It is a great starter camera for the serious young photographer, or anyone starting out for that matter. All the items in this particular package are of good quality, and the Canon products are excellent. 
23270 ehhhh, it s great and has great promise, but ultimately the colors are dull and the user experience leaves a lot to be desired. 
23271 Perfect!!! 
23272 Great case. Just what I expected. The insert holds everything perfectly. 
23273 Exactly the battery I was looking for. Product was shipped and at my house in 2 days. Very pleased. 
23274 Love the size & color. But, it can t hold an additional lens. Only one... 
23275 Very unstable. 
23276 The glasses became loose on the third day... I assume that means the filter is not functioning properly. 
23277 Great, but not perfect. 
23278 Works great! Good Quality! Would definitely recommend! 
23279 Decent picture. WAY over priced for a Chinese camera. Software is confusing if you have little experience. Night vision is good to about 30ft. Does not come with SD card. 
23280 It s a well thought out design and very snug on my Manfrotto sticks. Nobs are big and look like they aren t likely to break easily. We ll see about that. In any case, I think this one will last. 
23281 a necessity for use with cokin filters without having extra equipment 
23282 Love it! 
23283 Great backpack for DJI. Love it. 
23284 Good quality but can t use the protective lens cover on it. 
23285 very good for my a6000 setup 
23286 Have had 2 of these for about 4 months now, and they have never pulled up an error message on my D3300 or my D5300, have worked great, last just as long or longer than my En-El 14a. Will be buying more. Thankyou guys so much!! 
23287 Amazing shipping time. Got it within 3 days if the order. Was exactly what was pictured, well packaged. It is the 70d w. Had the wifi. Just awesome. Better quality accessories than I was even expecting. Thank you. 
23288 After using this cloth, my computer screen looks just like new-- it is crystal clear! 
23289 love these 
23290 very compact and very cushioned for travel. i have Nikon D7000 camera. the case is perfect. all my accessories fit very comfortably. very happy with this purchase 
23291 If you want to read my full review with some photos, I posted it on my blog: https://petecocophotography.wordpress.com/2015/08/31/neewer-vertical-grip-for-canon-6d/ 
23292 It working like Nikon Battery 
23293 Just what I expected 
23294 These stands were as described. 
23295 Cheap construction hence the price but adequately held my Nikon D5200 and Canon Vixia with no fuss. 
23296 The lens caps work great! My only complaint is that the adhesive on the strap didn t work for too long, but otherwise these work great. 
23297 There only need me open the APP and scan, no need the cable, it`s so easy for me 
23298 A part with a tripod hole is an excellent addition. 
23299 Very happy with the battery and the seller 
23300 Video quality very poor. See for yourself before making purchase decision. https://app.box.com/s/nxk36fuhqdkcyn1x3iugq1hklo0rzu3d Recorded at 720p 60fps A family member purchased 1 for me and I was about to place order for another one for bicycle but after viewing few recorded video, due to poor video quality, will be returning it. 
23301 Took it on an overseas trip of several weeks. When I went to use it it would not work. 
23302 Nice one for the price 
23303 Great protection. Bit bulky though... 
23304 Item works well but it took much longer to receive I paid for faster shipping and it was a Strain on my business because item took much longer 
23305 The product came broken and it hás locked into my lens. I have sent my lens to technical assistance to fix. Horrible. Don t buy! 
23306 I use this for my Canon T3 and it works very well and charges in the original charger that came with the camera. I love it. 
23307 I will not buy again, once clipped requires a screwdriver to unclip it from the camera 
23308 Picture quality was ok but the sound was no good at all, I sent it back and would never buy the item ever again Junk. 
23309 Second frame I have owned--seamless setup and great picture quality. 
23310 As expected still experimenting with this lens forbid is totally new for me. 
23311 Sturdy Case, fit s my Hero 4 silver. I m happy with it. 
23312 This was a good surprise 🎁. The camera 📷 was ready to shoot right after taking it out of the box. Easy to operate, and the pictures are clear and sharp. Anazing product. 
23313 This a good battery replacement than paying a crazy amount for the official canon battery. 
23314 Great all around package has everything you need and then some, great product 
23315 Exactly as I expected it to be. Works great. Thank you. 
23316 I was giving the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest opinion. Great product at a great price. Easy to setup and use. Very sturdy and easy to extend. Highly recommended! 
23317 NOT TOO HAPPY.. very complicated to install, not people friendly... I wont recommend this. 
23318 Did not work on arrival. Seller refunded money. 
23319 as described fast shipping highly recommend 
23320 very nice little camera for FPV flying a quadcopter... good clear picture and nice field of view. small and light 
23321 Amazing 
23322 For the price this bag is great. Love the security for travel. 
23323 Always like to have a reserve battery for my camera. This is proving to be very reliable. 
23324 This was so easy to install and has been so fun to use (though we seriously installed it as a security measure). Love it--and will probably buy a second one. 
23325 gopro is very handy. Beware that you do NOT get the micro SD chip with it and you will need to charge it before using it. 
23326 Works as expected Nikon D5200; this is IR not wireless and needs a line of sight. 
23327 Use them often, would buy many more. 
23328 Seemed good at first until the plastic broke. Can t find replacement parts. 
23329 Doesn t even compare to my Olympus - THIS CAMERA IS TOTAL CRAP. The interface is almost the same and I figured that I d give it a shot for $129. GARBAGE. Not waterproof. I repeat - NOT WATERPROOF. Terrible pics. I ll be requesting a refund. 
23330 Work 
23331 Great accessories 
23332 It ll tide me over for a while, but it s soft plastic and is very loose on the lens. Slightest bump and it falls off. 
23333 Works perfectly, just a little expensive. 
23334 It great to have spare batteries and it charges them quickly. I love having the car adapter. 
23335 Excellent product for the price ... and w/ spare batteries. Did the job for me. 
23336 Works great! 
23337 Just what I was looking for! 
23338 Batteries are a tight fit, but all in all, a good product!!! 
23339 Works as advertised. 
23340 Didn t fit my iPhone 5c right 
23341 I have received the product and with no problem. It is always good to have a warranty for expensive items. 
23342 Just as expected, nice quality for cleaning glasses. Didn t need individually wrapped, but its a great idea to keep them clean. 
23343 A good flash, energizer doesn t make camera flashs, another brand. The listing said this would work with my sony a58 dlsr. It doesn t fit the mount. Had to buy an adapter. Works fine now. As good a flash as those costing twice as much. 
23344 Very good attachment to have 
23345 I love it. 
23346 So perfect for the GoPro!! The clear case is Great!! It is working wonderful and with the mic 100% a most get if you want to do more with it 
23347 Not bad. All filters work except the 10x. Decent for price. Good for beginners wanting to learn a little. 
23348 Exactly what I needed. 
23349 It s usable, but the price is too high for a simple plate like this, especially I already bought two Dolica tripods. 
23350 Absolutely love it❤️ 
23351 This has proven to be an essential element in my pocket at all times while photographing. Tee cleaner part (not brush) works extremely well and conveniently. 
23352 It s ok. Smaller than I hoped for but it does the job 
23353 Works great 
23354 Nice filters 
23355 Was super easy to install and readjust. Is resistant to fingerprints, eye smudges, and protects the glass. Very worthwhile getting. 
23356 Terrible! This turns on the GoPro and makes it cycle through menus, takes pictures, etc. It is way too tight and doesn t fit right, caused my battery to die and my gopro to take hundreds of photos. Can t not recommend enough. 
23357 My frame quit functioning within 6 months, however the manufacturer has contacted me to offer a replacement. I will update my review when it is received, but I am very impressed by the customer service at this point. 
23358 Great 
23359 Excellent 3rd person in case something happens. 
23360 I already needed 
23361 Doesn t stay on very long even with a full charge. Kind of crappy, not nearly as close as it it was going to going to be 
23362 Returned them.....really is not way to attach to the sling because its a closed unit...you can not slide these on. I called the company and wondered what the purpose was....because the sling WAS a closed unit 
23363 Henry from Support was knowledgeable, patient and very helpful. The camera is very technical and requires too much maintenance for those who are not IT-inclined. 
23364 Works just as well as the official GoPro chestmount. Adjustable straps; Fits adults perfectly. 
23365 perfect replacement and on time. 
23366 Love this thing! My only wish is that the padded shoulder part covered a bit moreFor more padding, and that the adjustment buckle was in the front for quicker adjustments. 
23367 Was using the neck strap that came with my Fuji XE-1 and it was so bulky. Changed over to this wonderfully crafted little wrist strap and am a happy camper. I got the camera because it is small and light. The strap conforms and enhances those qualities. 
23368 Excellent cloths. Individually wrapped 
23369 Only has a hdmi out put dosent have the bnc out, or the rca out 
23370 A gift for my daughter ! It looks more expensive than it is .and she loves it!! 
23371 Works well for using a one or two sets of filters to cover the from element of your lens. 
23372 Great deal 
23373 Great!!! 
23374 Great 
23375 Very sturdy plate. I m using it on a flycam nano to make it easier to remove my Canon 70D. Works great. 
23376 I ve been using these batteries in a VIXIA HF R600, and they are performing perfectly. The camera displays the remaining battery life, exactly like the Canon battery. The charger works with these batteries and the original Canon battery. 
23377 Great 
23378 Always good product from STK. 
23379 Very helpful. Calvin was able to help me with my problem very easily. 
23380 Good picture quality for the price 
23381 Works great, fast charging 
23382 put it on my o ring for my water housing of my Sony action Cam and worked great! No leaks and kept the ring nice and lubed! 
23383 So far the batteries have performed as expected. Battery life is good. I haven t time it to determine how long it last. 
23384 Good quality for the price. 
23385 Just what I needed for a spider man car. 
23386 NO IDEA HOW MUCH MORE I CAN URGE ANYONE TO BUY THIS. Digital and cell phone images are great, but this!!! Is a must!!! 
23387 Cannot be used with a Sony genuine hard lens protector, which I didn t know before. 
23388 This is very comfortable to use especially when using a long telephoto lens while hiking. 
23389 Nice 
23390 excellent product. does what it says. 
23391 Maybe I need to go trough some learning but the pictures have odd colors and are blurry. 
23392 Product was exactly as described and at a great price and very fast delivery !!! Will be back to this sellers page !!! 
23393 This is a great LCD protector, and the only type (GGS) that I would even consider for my camera s. 
23394 Great photos 
23395 It s nice having extra batteries and the car charger. 
23396 Not as Advertised Wrong Item&#62;sent it back. 
23397 Excellent first timer s camera, great quality, video, and accessories are a nice added touch. The price deal was great too! I like it a lot! 
23398 Really happy with this accessory. I really like that as well as a pistol grip, it can be used as a small tripod. It has helped keeping my shots steady as opposed to using the handle on a traditional handy cam. 
23399 Works great. Could have made the knock out holes easier to punch out. 
23400 Fits camera well in both directions. Costs a little more but it works! 
23401 If you give a good description you ll always have a satisfied customer. 
23402 they are all useful product with reasonable price. 
23403 Fine so far. 
23404 These do an awesome job of cleaning!!! 
23405 Perfect. On time. 5/5 
23406 This camera mount works excellent for my bicycle. It is a very simple design, but sometime the simplest designs are the best, which is the case with this product. It attaches securely on my handlebars. Once secure it stays that way. My camera takes excellent pictures/video as I ride. 
23407 The quality is very good for the price. The ball is smooth, hardware are build to high quality. It is quite big and heavy, not a travel ball head. For stationary use, it is perfect. 
23408 It was nice A+ in my book 
23409 nice easy to use takes great photos 
23410 Great and handy ....easy to setup 
23411 ZERO STARS, this P.O.S. came with users guide written by some one with no working use of English and it never worked after we worked out the coded messages it came with. the old saying is true : you get what you pay for. 
23412 Terrible. Used one piece and it broke putting it on. The suction cup dose not work at all. 
23413 the straps don t handle the weight of all the glass and the camera. I am frequently adjusting the straps. the front pocket is awkward. 
23414 Worked as advertised 
23415 Nicely constructed and great fit for GX7 camera. I am quite happy with this purchase. 
23416 Really helpful to keep your gopro safe on your boards, bikes, and even wrists. Definitely recommend if you do not want to lose your gopro. 
23417 Very well made, it s comfortable and durable. It feels more secure in your hand than any handle. 
23418 Excellent product works as expected. 
23419 awesome. these batteries are great, came in quick, charged up pretty quickly and lasted for longer than they should on a charge. 
23420 Love it!!!! Excellent zoom! Going to take it on my cery first cruise with my girlfriend. I plan on taking some pictures and videos. 
23421 Wonderful lens 
23422 okey 
23423 This says that it will fit Sony Alpha cameras, but it did not fit my Alpha A6000. Not sure who gets the credit for the description, whether it s the manufacturer or Amazon. Big caveat emptor. I returned it of course, and have to look for another product. 
23424 Not bad, for more effect I added some wires 
23425 Works exactly as expected! 
23426 My daughter loves this camera fun for teens but pictures are pretty expensive about $1.00 each. 
23427 every thing ok 
23428 IT WAS BETTER THAN I EXPECTED!! PRICING WAS EXCELLENT 
23429 Great! 
23430 Excellent product. Thanks! 
23431 Great cam for recreation use. YES...It is Water Proof. We submerged it for 5 minutes or more and we continue to enjoy the benefits of this camera. Little heavy but durable. SPLASH 
23432 Used this case while white water rafting. I was able to fit two DSLR cameras into it and they remained dry and protected. Able to stand on the case too without impacting its contents. 
23433 I thought it was bigger but it works well with accessories. 
23434 These cameras are junk. Extremely poor video if you can get them to work at all. 
23435 Work well 
23436 This product met my expectations. 
23437 Kenneth was very helpful and figured out the problem. Everything working now. Foscam is a nice camera. It s great to be able to check on things when we are not at home. Thanks for the great service. 
23438 I bought this as a spare. I use it with my Sony A72 and it works well. Great price and I recommend it highly 
23439 Pretty decent product but a little tricky to install. Overall, I m fairly satisfied that it will protect that fragile screen on my G16. 
23440 Works perfectly fine in my E-M1. 
23441 The battery is broken 
23442 Great high quality product at a good price. From a company that stands behind thier product and are aiming for not just the highest of quality product, but top knotch customer service for any of your needs! Highly recommend this ND filter lack of color/ image distortion is suburb. 
23443 Fits perfect 
23444 Easy set up. We needed a barn camera to monitor our animals. The barn was well within our router range and this worked well for our needs. 
23445 Very pleased 
23446 Had some problems with recording button, sent it back to replay to fix and they changed it for a new one, working perfectly! Sellers experience was quite good and I can only recommend them. 
23447 Wish it had instructions 
23448 Recommend 
23449 Really great tripod. Stable and quick to setup. I have used this at weddings, events, portraits and filming. 
23450 Excelent product 
23451 filters - are ok but - the wipes had a cloud of dust on them 
23452 Love the product. Very easy to set up. Pictures are very clear. If putting outside I would suggest buying the adjustable mounts. 
23453 Quality of this tripod is excellent compared to my old one. Easy to use & transport. Really nice flexible piece of equipment for shooting from various angles. 
23454 nice 
23455 it s not working as expected it would work and I can t return it anymore 
23456 love this lens for landscape and astro photography. 
23457 When using a timer just won t cut it - remote control! 
23458 Awesome, thank you so much looks amazing! 
23459 Nice cable, armored from sharp edges. 
23460 Everything about this camera is great! Size and weight is so much better than my old camera. Fits easily in my pocket for on-the-go use. Mine was refurbished, but it looks new. Not a single problem with it so far. 
23461 Worked out great. 
23462 Easy to use. Practical size. Nick 
23463 I like the black over the silver. The bayonet action is smooth. 
23464 Good 
23465 Did not fit, did not respond to my inquiry. 
23466 Fit my Canon 28-135 IS just like the Canon version, makes me regret buying these overpriced Canon branded ones for all these years. 
23467 Thank you 
23468 Nice compact size for a good price. 
23469 Expensive but works and worth it! 
23470 Was worth the purchase it s very easy to use 
23471 Great! 
23472 I was disappointed that it doesn t come with a full instructional guide.I had to play with it to figure what most of the buttons do. 
23473 Fits perfect to the Coolpix AW130 Great stuff! 
23474 worked well enough for my purposes so far. I still have some more experimentation to do before I can give it my full approval 
23475 Easy to set up and excellent support available. First one was a breeze, second one ran into a small issue but Ed from customer support walked me through it easily! Would recommend and will purchase more dlink products in the future. 
23476 Regular 
23477 Good charger for my IS-200X sONY 
23478 This is a perfectly acceptable inexpensive camera bag. It s just not great. I am storing my 1950 s Voghtlander in it so OK for that since it sits in my closet most of the time. 
23479 Works well easy to use 
23480 It fits the Nikon P7800 perfectly. Not much room for anything else 
23481 Works very good.. Pic s are great. Not at nite... 
23482 great works love it , great price 
23483 Worth it for the price. The tripod is not that sturdy but you ll get use to it. 
23484 Soft rubber means good protecting, easy to pack and carry, and it s lightweight. 
23485 Really nice set. Has all you need for the camera. Seems to be well made. 
23486 Night vision works great still not hd but the regular video is so bad when played on a regular sized monitor its super grainy... didnt like this camera at all 
23487 Terrible..just terrible... I bought three camera s and could not even get one to hook up to the WiFi. Even the tech support (unfortunately one over worked person in California) could not even fix. Sending back. 
23488 unit was bad / ok day light but not at night / ir was bad (oversaturated). sent it back. 
23489 Although I had a cleaning set, I didn t have anything like this one. I gave my DSLR and good cleaning after I cleaned the CMOS. Now I use this set as my first cleaning attack before each major usage and am really happy, 
23490 The case the lenses comes in broke immediately upon opening it. 
23491 Just adding my five stars to the rest of the reviewers, the ring s threads are fine and attach to the camera and filter smoothly. The price is fair and the cloth is an added plus. 
23492 Got the product on time. Loved it, it took very good pictures and was very happy. Thanks 
23493 I bought this case for my boyfriend to use for his SJCAM. The SJCAM and his accessories all fit nicely in it. I was drawn to this case because it was one of the few I found that was big enough to accommodate his suction cup. 
23494 The item works great. Thank you. 
23495 Great product and price. Fast shipping! 
23496 Does what I need. Nice design and accessories. Glad I got it. 
23497 More than I expected for the money. Great deal and more gadgets than I could ever use. 
23498 Worked just as advertised. It better 
23499 Pretty cool stick, but beware, the clip that holds the remote is a little wonky-- I bumped it and the clip and my remote dropped to the bottom of the lake-- reinforcing it w duct tape would ve probably been the thing to do. 
23500 It work as intended, the price is good, waiting to see how long the battery last. 
23501 Handy! 
23502 Worked perfectly, including the couple of times I needed both hands and wanted to let the camera just bob on the surface. 
23503 Its very easy to scratch and it give blue tones to long exposure images- can be easily fix in lightroom, still trying to figure out white balance for different filters. 
23504 Have not used it yet but it looks nice 
23505 Doesn t fit the hero 2. Is there another piece I need? 
23506 I was learing about buying one of these on amazon, but it was a nice pleasant surprise! It worked absolutely wonderuland the quality is great, especially for the price! 
23507 Great 
23508 Excellent product and arrived on time. 
23509 Does not plug directly into the wall. Comes with chord (not pictured) 
23510 As promised, the picture keeper was very easy to use. However, the 16000 photo capacity picture keeper only held 6000 pictures, so be smart and buy one that is 3 times what you think you need. 
23511 Horrible. Upon attempting to remove it from my flash trigger, the end of the cord snipped off. ULTRA delicate junk. 
23512 These vibrating motors are great to make robots and vibrate a lot and effectively. The wires are a little short though (1cm) 
23513 Nice. I carry the camera in my purse, great protection. 
23514 exactly what I expected. good quality 
23515 I love it and recommend this product. 
23516 A right disaster. Not only are there no instructions in English, the flash gun stopped working after 2 sessions. It simply stopped coming on. Really disappointing. 
23517 Worst product ever! Its all plastic, its weak, the wind doesn t let it spin, even when there where no wind still doesn t spin. None of my timelapses ended up right. Not recommended 
23518 Works well but somewhat oversized. Fast delivery. 
23519 Doesn t really do high end FD lenses justice. Also could never figure out how to take out the optional element. 
23520 works well..no problems so far 
23521 Greate equipment, we re using it for a mine site and it gets really dirty and have no issues at all. Previous camera was lost and we had no doubt on getting the same as a replacement. 
23522 This bag is very spacious and secure. I travel often for filming projects and so far I m pleased with how this bag protects camera gear and additional items. 
23523 Love this bag, very comfortable to wear. Very durable. 
23524 I ordered this product, totally excited to get the fabulous DSC WX350 plus accessories for this amazing price. When it arrived, it was NOT the DSC WX350 at all! Instead, it was a DSX W830, a substantially less expensive camera with limited capabilities. 
23525 Did not work out sent back still waiting for credit. Should have paid more attention I had to send back to China cost me more in shipping then I was ever willing to pay it is not a good product I would not recommend it does not deserve to stars 
23526 Work well last a long time. 
23527 Worked great, bought 5 more for friends that I showed 
23528 I lost my charger some time ago and couldn t use my palmcorder until now. I was glad to find it. 
23529 Received the wrong size batteries. the description suggested this type for the camera, but they were not the right ones. 
23530 Love the products from cowboys studio 
23531 Good product 
23532 These lens caps and cords work as well as original equipment. Price was right. Arrived quickly. 
23533 Only able to use once went to use it again the red lights pop up on the back showing I have full battery life but the light doesn t come on anymore. Waste of money guess you get what you pay for ! 
23534 These offer a great value and super clear image. I would order these for friends! 
23535 Extremely unreliable when connecting over wifi. After two months it stopped connecting to my network at al, wifi or wired. 
23536 Just the perfect size for my Coolpix S9700!! 
23537 Great item for the price! 
23538 As advertised 
23539 Great scope. Get your scope level and its on the money locating objects. Doesn t view nebula really well at all. Grey spots in space. 
23540 Perfecto 
23541 Very satisfied and excellent multi-platform charger. Charges LifePO4. 
23542 good deal 
23543 Works as advertised; holds battery, looks nice 
23544 This works perfectly on my monopod in conjunction with the DP-50 QR Camera Plate. 
23545 Very well made, just like all their cases. Would recommend. 
23546 Daughter loved the border on the photos. Even at high school age all of her friends thought the product was great. 
23547 Takes great pictures. 
23548 working just wish it came with better instruction 
23549 Very good product 
23550 Great product, solid, and good price, I sold my old plastic clamp stands for thisones and im glad i did. 
23551 Just what we need 
23552 This summer I have coverted hundreds of slides to my computer, where I can edit them, make copies, or post them on Facebook. 
23553 Fits my Hero and all of the accessories 
23554 Working nice 
23555 Nice starter scope. It would be nicer if it came with a sky watching guide. 
23556 I m SO satisfied with this camera. I fell in love with it instantly. It s small and comfortable in my hand, the quality is great and all of the added accessories help as well. 
23557 it s an ok point and shoot getting all the extras were good the optical zoom just was not good enough to suit me. I ended up getting a canon SX50 refurbished from canon website for $179 
23558 Great product 
23559 Well made, very fast lens and a great deal. Very wide angle without much if any distortion in the edges. Really like this lens! 
23560 Great camera for the price! ! 
23561 State of the art Have had it for a month still learning what it can do 
23562 Take the time to acquaint yourself well worth it! 
23563 As described. 
23564 i like 
23565 Mine appeared to be used and had a tear in the flash wrap. Had to return. Nice very soft, even light comes from this thing. I used it sometimes for macro shots. You can pack this in the same slot for you laptop. 
23566 My niece loves it. takes awesome pictures. Color was cute and modern 
23567 Henry was very good could figure out remote view he login to my computer show and voila toke 5 minute very guy 
23568 Meet my Gitzo and Really right stuff head perfect.Some extra pouch for small tool and my Gimbal kit. 
23569 Quality isn t what I would expect for a samsung. The casing is cheap plastic and the actual video quality is on the poorer side. I think my samsung phone (note 4) takes better quality video. I was surprised and disappointed. 
23570 Great investment and I love it so much And here are some pic that I took for my Sony a6000. 
23571 Excellent product, it works perfectly. 
23572 Excelent product 
23573 Camera exploded when power was applied. I don t think the specs were correct saying 7-27v input. Looks like one of the resister fried. 
23574 use these to protect my lens 
23575 Good quality! Fits my Fujifilm X100 perfectly! 
23576 piece of trash, not even good enough to use once 
23577 [[VIDEOID:2159cfd3aadee35e75e247a07f4f2ce4]] A quick demonstration of the pros and cons of the Fastfire camera strap. 
23578 Cheap. Toy looking. 
23579 Returned 
23580 WORKS FINE, no complaint so far 
23581 Delivered on time with great packaging. Item was as described and completely met my expectations. I absolutely love this lens! 
23582 Great lens. Does exactly what I wanted. Take pictures of my kiddos outside for sports and fantastic landscape shots when on vacation. 
23583 excellent product, but no information or use recommendations included, would have been nice. Well made. Quick delivery, no issues. Did not need to contact company, used Go Pro, as described. No complaints. instructions. 
23584 Best baby monitor/security cam on the market. I sent the others brands back after seeing how easy to use and powerful the nest was. We ll be buying more for each room in the house. 
23585 Don t waste your money on this one. Parts falling off as I pulled it out of the box. Pieces cracked as I tried to put together. Didn t hold reflector. Total garbage. 
23586 Excellent 
23587 Perfect size, great zipper quality and material and has side bag for equipment. My carbide tripod for telephoto lens fits perfectly. 
23588 This was poorly and cheaply made. Don t waste your time or money. Big disappointment. Better to hide the camera among some books. I returned it at once. EW 
23589 Great product 
23590 Very good! 
23591 Works great. I already have it hooked up to my body board. Got some dope footy. 
23592 Smells like bad rubber for a while. But does the job fine 
23593 Great add-on camera, this is actually replacing one that failed to work upon installing. 
23594 as shown 
23595 Once you get the hang of it, it s easy to use and an overall awesome product. 
23596 Good, inexpensive! 
23597 Excellent buy!! 
23598 Great price 
23599 Excellent product. Excellent company. The BX-2 gives my gear extra protection and I feel confident nothing short of an elephant sitting on any of by BX-2 gear will cause any damage. I am extremely happy and highly recommend this product and the Brenthaven. 
23600 I purchased a a back up battery for my camera. This battery holds a charge, for a long time. 
23601 love it. 
23602 It is ok to make home pictures 
23603 Almost cant look at the moon without it. Works great! 
23604 Best full frame ever!! Nikon has done it again!! 
23605 good 
23606 Fit my SJ4000 good a snug. On mine though one of the legs for the clamping area was bent badly and barely works. But it does work. 
23607 I don t see any play, a good product for the price 
23608 bad product 
23609 Very nice kit! Planning on using it on vacation out west. I love Canon products and so far so good. 
23610 Still working in my Olypus. 
23611 Fantastic FPV camera. So much better than using a Mobius for FPV. 
23612 Not an east fit! 
23613 does exactly what it needs to do... i little scary to try it, but it really works 
23614 Thank you 
23615 difficulty using. My fingers are too big!! 
23616 ok 
23617 weird little robotic guy I guess it works great for scaring people 
23618 Great product 
23619 Good quality pictures, compact design, and easy to use. 
23620 The best action cam. None compare. 
23621 I bought h t these for a trip. They are an excellent buy and I have confidence in this brand. 
23622 I have received it well. 
23623 It works just as I expected for the price I paid. I love that I can take photos that don t look as selfies... 
23624 My son likes it a lot. 
23625 Just what I needed for my new SX60 and a spare battery 
23626 This worked really well - comfy and easy to locate! 
23627 It works but did not come with a memory card 
23628 Great value, wish that camera was more wide angle. 
23629 letters of &#34;celestron&#34; logo are cheap stickers, and got lost rapidly 
23630 More difficult to collapse in comparison to other brands. 
23631 Very cheap casing but it will do the job. 
23632 So cute i love it , and some people say it has a nasty smell but really imine doesnt smell funky 
23633 So happy my birthday is saturday now i have a baggie to wear with my outfit to carry my camera 
23634 Best money I have spent. Love this product 
23635 Very nice lens, tack-sharp 
23636 Great product 
23637 Sweet produce. Better than expected build quality and fit. 
23638 Works well easy quick app install and remote view. Haven t done the port forwarding yet. Although major issue with speaker and mic very close on camera you get a lot of echo and feedback 
23639 Put in a new micro card, can t get product to work at this time. Been trouble shooting for a week now and I ve tried everything (yes, including the reset button.) Don t see any way to reach out to the company for customer service. Wishful thinking I know. 
23640 The title says this item has two hot shoes. Not so! A &#34;hot&#34; shoe is electrically connected to the camera, which controls the flash triggering. This item merely holds the flash in a bracket. It s up to you to connect it to the camera somehow. 
23641 I highly recommend Celestron lenses in general and this kit is tops and worth it when purchased with the scope. 
23642 This is one of my favorite purchases I ve made in a while. The quality is great and fits my 30 pound dog perfectly. Get ready for some of the most hilarious GoPro video you will ever shoot. 
23643 Bought it for my Mom. It s her first digital camera, and she was a reluctant convert from film. She loves it. 
23644 This is a terrible case. Do not buy this product! I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased it. My camera was ruined in only 35 feet of water. 
23645 wrong lens 
23646 Great product! 
23647 Super fast delivery. Great value. Very good product. 
23648 If the pockets were a bit deeper and a bit tighter to prevent the memory SD and Micro SD cards from coming loose in the case I would have given it a five star rating. 
23649 Good quality and great price. 
23650 As described. Good value. 
23651 The best camera I have bought so far. In great condition and delivery was fast. Thanks. 
23652 decent case 
23653 It does what it s supposed to do. It works great 
23654 Exactly what I needed. Exactly what was advertised. Very high quality. 
23655 The device works the same as the 4 port system, With a few additional settings and options. Had it setup and running in less than 10 minutes. 
23656 Works as advertised. Will allow having filters mounted. 
23657 Bought as a gift for my son. He loves it -- fit perfectly. 
23658 love it! 
23659 will not hold a charge. do not buy 
23660 Unbelievable photo backpack. Took it to Europe for two weeks and it was so easy to carry my Canon 70D with 18-135 and 24-70 lenses. Lightweight and sturdy. Best camera bag for traveling. 
23661 I would not recommend it I do not like it 
23662 Excellent camera rolling backpack, it is everything I expected, liads of room for camera bodies and various lenses. 
23663 I got this camera and it got stuck trying to turn on, I got a replacement and it also won t even power up. 
23664 Does exactly what it s supposed to do at half the price of Manfrotto s version. 
23665 Perfect, exactly as described. 
23666 I got this tripod and it fell apart but the customer service reps were responsive to my needs and sent me one that is very study and awesome. Thanks guys! 
23667 Great point and shoot with some more customizable options. Large to fit in a pocket 
23668 Two excellent working batteries for a Very reasonable price. \m/ 
23669 I have a Sony HX9V. It says it´s good for the camera, but I´m afraid it will break my lens. When turned on, it fits to tight, and the case pushes the lens to it´s sides. 
23670 they worked well 
23671 Very good product,best you can get for an instant camera! 
23672 It s my personal &#34;photography assistant&#34; that holds the reflectors, and the flowers, too. 
23673 All metal, well made. It does not think down too small though. 
23674 Easy to install. Does what it should. Delivered new, in perfect condition and on time. Priced right. 
23675 This is incredibly flimsy, with weak clips that hold the hood on the lens. I honestly can t figure out why people are writing positive reviews for this item. 
23676 great camera 
23677 Well made and as compact as can be for a mirror less camera. Fits my NX500 with kit lens and flash as well as two batteries in the pocket. Much nicer than carrying a bag everywhere and worrying about putting the bag down 
23678 I returned this product. It did not fit my Sony NEX-5T as advertised. 
23679 Haven t used it yet but came as advertised and fits fine. 
23680 Fits my Canon S120 perfectly. Zips up both side making quick and easy to remove. Sturdy build. 
23681 Product as described, and function at least as well as Sony batteries. I haven t measured the capacity claims, but they do seem plausible. 
23682 This is the coolest camera. Takes pictures with easy and a clear shot. New to it but it has a lot of features I have to try yet.\JIM 
23683 Great camera 
23684 great item. I have not been disappointed by any of the Vortex optics and here again they did great. It is a bit heavy, but compared to binos this are way lighter unless money is no object. 
23685 Great item for a great price! and awesome service from eco-Fused to boot! Will definitely buy again! 
23686 good 
23687 Works great no complaints. 
23688 Best bang for the buck speedlight. Sync @ 1/8000! Rivals if not surpasses other pro models priced more than double of this. Plus it is a master flash to control other speedlights. 
23689 awtnu47533tutrerytutreyu nyteyrste5y 
23690 Worth the $$ as an alternate to Macro lens.. 
23691 Doze not respond well on the PTZ controls. Long delay. Keeps show up ofg line in my dlink. I try two different units and both have the same problems 
23692 Let s you control multiple GoPro cameras remotely. Great for controlling that camera on your head, selfie stick, tripod or other equipment. 
23693 I really like it 
23694 It is better than nothing. 
23695 Does the job. 
23696 Thank you Very much 
23697 Great camera, I have purchased 3 of these already to record our Church services. They are great in low light and have a quality image. 
23698 The DVR needs to be reset after a week of two. Eventually replaced the dvr 
23699 Nice, cheap, and works well. 
23700 great camera, has very nice video quality, very compact. easy to do vlogs and whatever else. 
23701 Short version: There are some definite quality control issues with this product, but on the whole it does what it says on the tin at an unbeatable price. Definitely a buy if you have Prime and so can return your first one if that particular unit is of poor quality. 
23702 This camera is really an awesome camera for the money. Yes it is mirror less but still works very very well. I am extremely satisfied with it. 
23703 its pretty good but smaller than expected I thought i was getting a larger bag than I already have to hold all my stuff , this bag barely fits nikon d7000 
23704 The pen will not take a charge and cannot be recognized by the computer. When i press the record button, it stops in 5 to 7 seconds. 
23705 Excellent productos, very responsable the seller upon delivery recommend 
23706 These work great and last longer then the one that came with the Camera. 
23707 My second GoPro remote and it s better than my first one (GoPro 3). This one works well with my GoPro Silver and also works well within the App. Comes with a wrist strap unlike my first remote! 
23708 Amazing lens good deal 
23709 I had this battery overnighted to me to record my sons 9th birthday. It wouldn t take a charge. Very disappointing and very bad business. Get your S#%T together or close the doors!! 
23710 Just one word.......awesome! 
23711 Good stand. 
23712 Good fit:) 
23713 I really like my Canon battery grip. It does a great job. 
23714 We purchased this as a gift and it was perfect! My husband loaded a memory card to make it easy for the recipient. It is a smaller frame which makes it easy to transfer to any room you like. Affordable and it was well received by the recipient. 
23715 don t work camera. Please if you change this one. 
23716 Very nice item, Exactly what I expected to receive. 
23717 Works perfect with my 1D Mark IV, charges quick, hols a charge and is recognized by my camera. This is a perfect replacement for the OEM battery. I just purchased a spare battery for a fraction of the cost of a Canon battery.. 
23718 I used this on my new sony a7rm2, a great way to protect LCD from scratches. 
23719 Its a snug fit which is reassuring however the access panel is not accessible unless it is take off prior to placing the camera in the mount but as I m typing this I m realizing its an intentional design and I ll change this to 5 stars. 
23720 Getting amazing full zoom shots! The mega OIS got me hand held shots at full zoom that I would have needed a trip-pod for previously. Appreciated the lens accessories that came with it. Taking it with me to Yellowstone & Grand Teton NP s next week! 
23721 My first purchase on amazon and very very happy with it. I am an amateur photographer. The photos attached were taken with the 36mm extension tube on my sony a58... 
23722 good 
23723 I love this lens! Great quality/value. 
23724 Great camera. Excellent condition. Everything arrived as expected. 
23725 Great camera. Can t beat for waterproof shooting. 
23726 Not a bad deal for a starter. 
23727 Purchased this camera for my husband. He loves it. 
23728 Works great, easy to install, had a previous D-Link which was very erratic and difficult to install. I returned the D-Link. 
23729 TERRIBLE. Two of these snapped and flew apart within two hours of clamping a backdrop to a stand. Almost injured crew. Do not buy. Potentially dangerous. 
23730 We like our first NIX digital frame so well that we purchased a second. This model has a 15&#34; screen versus our previous 12&#34;, making it easier to see photo details from across the room. Easy to setup, great image clarity, Very pleased with the frame. 
23731 Strap BROKE with my Panasonic Lumix FZ1000 on it,after only a few weeks.I’d give it a negative 10 star rating if possible. 
23732 Great!! 
23733 I have two CAMERAS not working i need to send back. I have 6 cameae install and they are work find 
23734 Not excellent 
23735 it broke within 3 weeks.... 
23736 great 
23737 Fits in a bag, easy to store or carry, perfect for large cameras with zoom lenses or flash attachments. Works on anything flat, take Maine every where, fits in the bottom of my camera bag 
23738 Bought it for my husband, he loves it!!! 
23739 This camera is a point and shoot that tries really hard to be more than that. Too many options. In addition, the battery life is super short. I would not recommend this camera. Buy a SLR digital or a cheaper point and shoot. Not worth the extra $$. 
23740 not as good as i expected should have got the 70-300mm 
23741 Decent stick not too stiff at full extention but good for the price. You wont be jumping off cliffs with this guy but i m sure i will have uses for it 
23742 This does not work at all with the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 I bought at the same time. I want to return it. 
23743 easy to install and great picture. 
23744 Worked good but needed some info on controls and no Customer support available! 
23745 So much brighter pictures inoors 
23746 It has a good handle and the tip is sturdy but gentle enough 
23747 Fast delivery. Use it once and works. 
23748 I needed these canisters for an experiment in my class, and a lot of the lids didn t snap on tightly. 
23749 Works great! This was originally a gag gift for my husband s birthday, but he really likes it. 
23750 Works just like advertised. Cannot expect more. 
23751 came with bundle don t use head strap 
23752 amazing, arrived within a couple of day,s 
23753 great product 
23754 Wow! This light is very bright and exactly what I was looking for! I was trying to get a very specific light style for products and people shots and this light was perfect. 
23755 good value,too bad the camera is broken, but it did charge the battery... 
23756 I received mine in the time that said it would arrive. Very happy with my new drone. Great power. 
23757 Product was broken, the phone holder to be exact. Managed to glue it my self. I guess you get what you pay for. 
23758 Fast and reliable. Overnight shipping a success! 
23759 Great! 
23760 This pan, in my opinion, was very poorly constructed - it broke on me after two hours of use. On the bright side, my ability to understand Chinese translated to English is getting much better. :-) 
23761 This is really really good and I recommend it. However, I am 66 inches tall, and this is only 50 inches tall. 
23762 Love it 
23763 Easy to set up and it works perfectly 
23764 Work great. 
23765 Cheap and totally does the job 
23766 Fairly easy to install. Seems like a fair price for this good product 
23767 Everything works fine. Battery capacity is about the same as the original Olympus battery. 
23768 It was an excellent item delivered on time and intact. Thank you. 
23769 A little too small. 
23770 This is a real 808 #16 v3. Arrived in 7 days of purchase. Everything worked as advertised. 
23771 Great budget flash with plenty of features and solid construction for the price. 
23772 I ordered. They sent promptly. Product good. I am happy. 
23773 Such an awesome camera love it 
23774 No instructions included 
23775 It was exactly what I was looking for in this price range. 
23776 I love it,, the price was very reasonable 
23777 the camera works as expected,, picture is clear and I do not have any complaint 
23778 This is a super easy to use digital frame. I love the video option. I previously had a Kodak pulse frame and loved it, but this one is equally as good and a much larger size! 
23779 Had no idea GoPros were even bordering on affordable. Between the camera itself, the items that come in the starter pack, and even GoPro s own FREE software you get to edit videos... this thing is simply amazing!! 
23780 Love the features of this camera. However, the battery life leaves much to be desired. 
23781 My daughter had enjoyed it so much. She was completely satisfied and extatic with the case. 
23782 camera takes great photo s, not overly heavy. camera has worked really well for taking photo s as just an enthusiast. 
23783 I use these batteries in a Nikon 1 V3. The battery life is degrading significantly with each use. If you have a Nikon battery, these are good back-up batteries. I would not use one of these batteries as your main camera battery. 
23784 Great batteries, exceeded my expectations... 
23785 great invention 
23786 Just as described..works well with a steady hand. Does not feel cheaply made. 
23787 good basic point and shoot camera. in some lightings, the pictures get an odd orange glow. if the light does not work well, i just switch to black and white and that fixes the problem. zoom works well. over all, i am very happy with this camera 
23788 Five out of five stars 
23789 It s ok for it s price easy to use 
23790 Sony recommended website product for a6000. Fits and protects hot shoe. 
23791 I use this mini tripod all the time. It holds my webcam and my cameras. This is the perfect size for small spaces. 
23792 Package met all expectations. Wifi works great. Good quality pictures. 
23793 make static noise but good images. 
23794 good replacement for a broken one I had 
23795 We are very happy with the product and the excellent service. 
23796 Works fine on my Sigma 150-600 S lens. Fits in my two RRS ball heads and clamps. Price is right, no flexing. 
23797 Works like a charm! 
23798 Very useful when you need a backup battery. I highly recommend! 
23799 More shots with the Nikon that with the less-expensive after-market batteries. 
23800 good product 
23801 Have used it with sunrise and sunset to enhance the color, works fine. 
23802 Best camera I ever had. Pictures and movies are crystal clear. Great battery life. Used it on charger to record memorable motorcycle rides in all kinds of weather. Sound is great too. 
23803 Loved this product! Was perfect for making personal postcards and was super durable and easy! 
23804 Temperature sensors on the unit don t seem to be working right. 
23805 ok 
23806 Good 
23807 the chroma key green screen is a great item. Its working for me and I am having fun with it. Thank you for the great item. 
23808 Takes awesome photos 
23809 Very easy to install and fits PERFECTLY. 
23810 A lot of things I will not use but the price is great. The case does not fit everthing so well but it works. 
23811 Great camera for the price. Easy to use and produces quality pictures. 
23812 Nice camera, good price but the accessories are very modest 
23813 Good for sealife...all tipe 
23814 Bought three of these, two worked and connected well, one was a bit tricky and I had to move it closer to the controller to get it to work. A bit pricey for what it is, I am now building my own with mysensors. 
23815 Works great, but wish it fit my head. A tad to big big. Would it be to late to send back for my size with measurements? 
23816 Work great to clean sunglasses camera ect. Awesome product 
23817 Fast shipping and charger works great! Thanks 
23818 This camera is cheap , its ok to use 9 years old 
23819 Nice camera system 
23820 ALL WENT WELL 
23821 This rig is just what I was hoping for ... compact ... easy to use and store ... puts me right on the hitch ball with ease. 
23822 It s great for webcams or cameras! 
23823 Worked fine, the price was good, but too long to get here. As a back up its what I needed would buy again. 
23824 Just what my GoPro needed! Strong!!! 
23825 Awesome product 
23826 Overall The Best Video Camera I Have Used. Amazing 1080p Video Quality 
23827 worked. serves its purpose 
23828 Really wish this had more area for my extras. I will need a bigger bag, but this does secure my camera well. 
23829 One of the plastic clips broke the first time I opened it. 
23830 I love it! Lightweight, sturdy, and so easy to set up and change placements. Would recommend! -Canon Rebel T5i user 
23831 It was a present for my teen son, he really like it. 
23832 Awesome camera Such an improvement over my old t2i. I never realized how much better my pictures could get. Works great in lower light even without a flash. Accessories are a nice add on 
23833 Great case!!.... My Canon fit into it nicely....... 
23834 I like it very much. It is pretty discrete too. However if you use the two camera feature the video quality drops. 
23835 Almost impossible to get on....you have to remove the hood, put it on and then reattach the hood. 
23836 Full featured controller for your Canon. 
23837 Great Thank you 
23838 Used this mount to record videos for my soon-to-be Youtube Channel. 
23839 Terrific for a DIY security system. 
23840 I should have done a little more research before buying. I found picture hangers that are almost exactly the same for only $2. Otherwise it does okay. 
23841 I m really enjoying this scope so far. Very easy to assemble. Saturn and the moon look amazing. If you re new to amateur astronomy and you don t want to spend a lot initially but you want nice optics, you should get this scope! 
23842 9/3 update: Used for a week on photo sessions on Appledore Island, ME. The strap was GREAT! Easy to carry camera with this attached (Nikon D5300 with Tamron 18-300). Looking for neck relief on upcoming trip to Italy. 
23843 I love this compact camera 
23844 Definitely wasn t new like it stated so I returned it and went to my local Best Buy to get a NEW one. Love the camera. 
23845 Perfect! 
23846 Looks great on my strobes, Works great, Priced great~ 
23847 Very nice flash. Works very well on my d3300 Very quick on the recharge between shots 
23848 Resolution so poor that it was virtually useless. Horrid video and photo quality. Get the 12mp and save yourself a headache. 
23849 Very pleased with this purchase 
23850 Arrived on time, so far the functionality of the product works good as described in the mfg spec 
23851 Outstanding!!!! They are super clear and bright. Unless you like to throw money out the window, there is NO need to buy the German brands at double the price. These are VERY VERY GOOD. 
23852 works well for the picture but finding a way to feed it not so easy finnally taped it to an electrical tape so i could run it in the pipe 
23853 Great case. Fits the Nikon Coolpix S9900 camera well. However, it doesn t leave a lot of space for an additional battery and cables. 
23854 It was used -- scratches on display and buttons. Clearly previously owned. 
23855 ok 
23856 Cable came quickly and works great! 
23857 Everything you need and more. 
23858 Trash !!! Terrible !!! Bad image !!! 
23859 Great camera. 
23860 This kit is a good all purpose kit and will fit most needs when used with a camera that has the standard screw posts such as the contour. Everything worked as advertised and meets the required needs. I would recommend this. 
23861 As Expected 
23862 I thought this would be good to hold my thumb drive but the strap is too stiff. 
23863 This kit contains all that you ll need. 
23864 it s a great little camera. A bit difficult to get the exact settings you want. 
23865 Great piece. Fit my non-Nikon MBD-10-Like battery grip as well. Great with the ENEL-4A with the D700 for faster frame rate. 
23866 awesome! 
23867 Awesome I like how it locks so it won t just keep turning. 
23868 Manufacture has delivered as promise on both product and specification. One camera crack; but, was immediately resolved by manufacture. Great service!! Replied all inquires and questions. Keep up the good work!!! 
23869 I didn t receive exactly as what shown and described, The dual battery charger replaced with a single battery charger. The wall charger which has 2 usb slots is not included. The usb cable not included. More description about what I received can be shown in the attached photo. 
23870 Product received as expected 
23871 I was so excited to find this product! I have a Sony NEX-C3 and needed some better lighting for my pictures. I ordered this and the Chromo 216 LED CI-216 light and they paired perfectly together. 
23872 too complicated. software glitchy or not working. useless piece of crap. 
23873 Fit great 
23874 Works great! 
23875 Excellent light meter. I use it mostly for landscape and wildlife photography and it dies everything I expected, and more. 
23876 Quite easy to use and was a present.... 
23877 Sturdy and nice 
23878 Do not work 
23879 Here is a shot from the camera on my last trip! 
23880 its not what i was looking for but it will have to do. :( 
23881 very bright LED light, works great when natural light is less then desirable. 
23882 work like my oem canon ones in my 5dmkiii. no issues 
23883 very poor quality, the picture is not clean, wasted my money !!!!!!!!!!!! 
23884 This is a good starter pack of all different accessories for the GoPro. All good condition 
23885 As noted in previous reviews, this setup is great for the money. There isn t much for instructions, but enough to puzzle it out, The stands are a bit shaky, so be careful. 
23886 Great item, delivered on time. 
23887 This makes using the camera outside in bright sun soooo much easier. I can actually see the viewfinder screen. It fits on the screen just fine and stays on. I folds up to fit in my bag nicely. Recommended for anyone who shoots outside a lot. 
23888 This works great on my monopod and was so inexpensive. 
23889 Very accurate delivery time 👍🏼 Thank you! 
23890 Great fit. Customise interior to suit. Holds 5 batteries, spare props, ipad, prop guards. Feel confident my P3P could arrive safely in spite of the best efforts of airline baggage handlers. Will put it to the test this winter. Similar quality to Pelican. 
23891 I love it! Material and appearance was just as expected, and I like that I can double it as a purse :) 
23892 perfect 
23893 Fits well you need to cut to fit 
23894 Works as stated. 
23895 Screen was a perfect replacement. A little assistance from a YouTube video and fixed my camera in 15 minutes and at a fraction of the cost of taking it to a repair centre. 
23896 Only fair. 
23897 expectations were met for this order. 
23898 Great product! 
23899 Not hi tech 
23900 Great camera; easy to use. 
23901 Appears to be good quality, easy to apply. I m not very good at applying stickers however it still looks great 
23902 Amazing.. I loved it!!! 
23903 nice 
23904 This is a terrific cord. I especially appreciate te short length of it which helps with the camera to flash on a bracket problem without havig so much extra cord that it gets in the way. All functions on the flash work perfectly. 
23905 Nice camera and good pictures/video. Needs more accessories. Camera does not fit into clip 1 so the only way to hold the camera is with the waterproof case. That makes it inconvenient for using it as a dash cam or such. 
23906 Great price for what I was looking for. Fast shipping. 
23907 Just the right size for my camera and travel gear. Very well made and sturdy enough for expeditions and such. Case Logic is a company whose quality has always been top notch in my opinion and this camera case is no exception. 
23908 Not quite as pictuerd, There is no drain on the one I got and there is a folding center handle and also the lable that was on the lid was very dificult to remove and left glue residue 
23909 Steppers functioned properly and included specifications were helpful. Included PC board makes mating with Arduino quite easy. 
23910 Excellent batteries 
23911 This camera is so easy to use. I purchased it mostly to take pictures of my children, but I have since expanded. Ive had a canon t4 rebel, and this is definitely better and more convenient. 
23912 charges my camera up right 
23913 great 
23914 Mine leaked as well. Still floated, but worried about future use. Free diving in 15-30 deep water. Great tool and easy to point and shoot, but again worried about the seal and it filling with water and sinking :( 
23915 Not disappointed 
23916 great case for a camera and your essentials. great quality. Just a tad on the small side. Still not sure if I m going to keep or return it. 
23917 Does the job. 
23918 This was a gift to go with the phantom great combo... 
23919 I am happy with the drone. it works great 
23920 cheap / should have brought the real thing 
23921 No good 
23922 These are great lens cloths, you can t beat them for the price. I keep them all over the place to make sure I never find myself without one. Plus, they rep the best Nikon users forum on the internet, how could you possibly go wrong? 
23923 Fits in place very easily, blocks out most of the unwanted light and made of soft rubber so very comfortable. 
23924 Worked as expected. I passed this one on to my Grandson. 
23925 Works just as expected, charges my camera batteries quickly. Great deal for so many accessories, and now I won t get caught with a dead battery all the time. 
23926 Nice system for the cost. 
23927 great seller - delivered as promised! 
23928 Good battery, good fit for canon camera and battery life is on par with factory OEM battery. 
23929 good product 
23930 Great product, Thanks. 
23931 this camra does a great job. I love it 
23932 Camera stream is awesome! The only issue so far is getting the video to record on motion. 
23933 Fit good 
23934 Not much to say.. Does its job, seems to have a comparable life span to the Nikon counter part. :) 
23935 Perfect 
23936 Works fine. Took off a point for lack of clear instructions. I had to find video instructions from Orion on YouTube. I was able to figure it out from that. Well made. 
23937 I film a lot of events, and this lens helps me get those emotional close up / shallow focus shots without having to move my gear all over the place. 
23938 Received all ordered items promptly; everything works well. 
23939 Shipped quickly. Seem to be just a tad wider that the originals. Still work though. 
23940 Works perfectly. Haven t had any issues with this adapter 
23941 Not as expected, but great to learn on. 
23942 Works well, good suction to smooth surfaces as long as they re clean. 
23943 No web interface for configuration or viewing. Realize solely on mobile Android or iOS app. Camera goes offline several times a day and you must power cycle the camera to bring it back online. When the camera does operate, it works well with good image quality and speedy PTZ. 
23944 Film worked as intended, wish it was less cost effective, remember to not shake the photos and to place in the box the film came in to help develop them faster. 
23945 The battery was exactly what I needed 
23946 This item was returned as it did not support continuous streaming. I also found their customer support to be subpar. I returned it and paid the extra money for a nest camera. 
23947 Excellent 
23948 battery consumer and sucks the flash doesnt turn on at all times 
23949 Good Back Up Camera or for indoor. 
23950 Perfect. 
23951 Works great #GFGENT 
23952 Very clear in quiet areas. However when there is a fan near by or loud ac, it causes interfence and you will hear static throughout the entire recording, or sometimes not even record sound. 
23953 great purchase 
23954 this is my fourth manfrotto bag they are just grate lots of customizable things and great weight balance when you have your laptop + camera overall a great product 
23955 Works great! 
23956 Perfect replacement for original D750 Eyecup. 
23957 Perfect if you want to pack in your suitcase. 
23958 I love this camera. I wanted one that takes batteries and this is the one. I m still learning all the possibilities with this camera. It s very nice. 
23959 great seller - delivered as promised! 
23960 Works great! 
23961 looking forward to using in belize. 
23962 Inability to set shutter speed below 1 second makes it less useful for my application. 
23963 Love it Way to go with go pro 
23964 It s not very stable but thankfully it worked for what I needed to do. 
23965 Great mount got to 100 mile per hour on my motorcycle it the camera didn t flinch a bit Is great to take great shot and can be used on almost any helmet. Go pro outdid themselves 
23966 All sorts of FUN crafty items to dress up the photographs. Bright colors and designs. My granddaughter just loves this. I gave this pack of accessories as a birthday present along with the Mini 8 instant camera. (Everything old is new again! Remember the old Polaroids?) 
23967 Does what it said it would. 
23968 I love this hand grip, it was so much easier to carry my camera around with this grip. I am not a big fan of having my camera dangle around my neck. 
23969 Works great! Love the attachments...it is a lot easier than the 3..not as dramatic for the counter balancing 
23970 Awesome camera and great customer service from Calvin 
23971 I used the RFN-4s kit for the first time last week and it worked flawlessly on every shot. Set up and installation was easy, I am very satisfied 
23972 ok 
23973 NIce quality 
23974 Work great d5300 in vello battery grip. No errors. 
23975 Tricky to power on. Hold the power button for more than 4 sec. 
23976 When I got his camera it looked like the package had been opened and when I turned on the camera it had 3 photo saved to the camera of a person and his house. It sketched me out so I am taking it back and getting a new one. 
23977 The first time I used it, one of the prongs stayed in the wall socket when I unplugged it. 
23978 What I like 1) distributes weight well 2) camera always at the ready 3) camera is in a comfortable position for walking 4) strap attaches to the cameras strap lug securely and does not obstruct use of my tripod - great strap 
23979 Camera is great good working condition, actually its like brand new 
23980 Excellent. 
23981 Exceeded our expectations. Work great and I got these 4 for the same price of just ONE at Best buy. More like &#34;Worst buy&#34; if you ask me. Thanks CamKix! 
23982 Resolution is good if the camera does not move - takes a while to fill in detail. Wifi is very difficult to set up. I use DHCP reservation but the IP does not renew properly without multiple power cycles. 
23983 I like them alot 
23984 perfect replacement for the original 
23985 Fits great, functions as advertised. I love it and I m happy that I saved so much money. 
23986 If there is a product deserving on 0 stars then this is it! It does not even do basic magnification let alone night vision! The material looks deceptively metallic when in fact its only a very cheap plastic. 
23987 I was so impressed at the quality of these batteries. They are as good if not better than my Canon and Wasabi Power batteries. Well worth the price! 
23988 excellent 
23989 Cheaper and quicker than ordering from china 
23990 compact sized yet versatile. i can use it on my portable cameras and accessorizing with some attachments, also with cell phones. 
23991 It was larger then I was looking for .....had to return....but looked like a great camera. 
23992 This NVR is perfect, comes with 4 x 100ft Ethernet cables and the cameras are very nice. Hate the software interface, hence 4 stars. The software for viewing and replaying recording could be more user friendly. 
23993 best idea ever... 
23994 Battery is slightly smaller than my original, causing it to fit uneasily into the battery charger provided with the Camera, but it did charge OK and does fit into the phone without difficulty and seems to work OK. 
23995 The battery fits, and worked right away. 
23996 the only down side to the kit was the selfie stick...it spins upside down under the go pro s weight, otherwise excellent. 
23997 Met requirements 
23998 I was amazed by all the extras I got with the camera. The pictures are outstanding. 
23999 Dresses up the GoPro 3. Need a wrench to tighten thumb screws. Can t get a grip on them with fingers to tighten the GoPro so it won t move. 
24000 Camera is great for the first time DSLR user! In my case that happens to be a 13 year old - and she is now taking incredible photos and having fun. 
24001 At the price point this works great for off-camera flash power! I m a wedding photographer and can use it almost all day with rechargeable batteries before I need to swap in new batteries. 
24002 It is a little slow with regards to synchronizing with the phone/app. 
24003 Very easy to use....not great quality picture 
24004 Nice looking leather case. Good colour. Seems sturdy enough. 
24005 Love this camera.. Easy to set up and easy to use.. It notifies me right on my iphone and I just click on the app and I see everything. I love the fact that I can look back and see stuff.. 
24006 Its geniune Pelican Case. Very duriable. Been every where with it since I bought it and it is still good as new.... inside. 
24007 i love it...as expected 
24008 Pretty sturdy for the price, nice direct lighting, although to need all four up to get a well lit scene, and it s almost impossible to iron the wrinkles out of the supplied back drops. 
24009 Seem to work just as well as the one that came with my camera 
24010 Got these in perfect condition. Great for off camera flash and works just as good as Pocketwizard but a fraction of the price. You can use them for fill flash outside or to help compensate low light at wedding receptions. added bonus- was here 2 days after I ordered them! 
24011 My granddaughter enjoyed using the stickers on her photos. 
24012 Cheap and plentiful microfiber cloths. I wear glasses, so I like to have access to these things in various locations throughout my apartment. They re also good for cleaning laptops, computer screens, and phones. They re useful and effective. 
24013 Super Sweet! 
24014 It s simply fit and well. I don t know how good the one made by Fuji, but this one just works no problem at all. And the price is something that you don t even need to have a second thought. 
24015 Looks very good! Fits my canon g7x just fine. No space for anything else! 
24016 The product, packaging and supplies are all wonderful. The camera is easy to use and light weight, highly recommended. 
24017 Definitely too expensive but it s never let me down 
24018 amazing camera! 
24019 Leo was very knowledgeable and able to set it up very quickly for me via remote setup! 
24020 Excellent value for backup power. 
24021 Doesn t fit - and was returned 
24022 Works just like expensive version 
24023 Haven t used it yet, but sure it will do the trick 
24024 Fabulous for the price. The moslins are a little thin, but what do you expect for the price. Also, ironing them was a bit of a pain, but that s the nature of the beast. 
24025 Love the it😀 
24026 Good Film that s all. 
24027 Had to make a few alterations for horseback riding but overall not a bad little system. Only bad point is that I had to get a locking washer for the screw for the camera, it would back out very easily before hand 
24028 Good fit on 70 to 200 f 2.8 zoom lens 
24029 Very convenient and light to carry around 
24030 awesome and very compact 
24031 just the best 
24032 Great Backpack! Plenty of room for everything. Deep pockets and tons of padding to protect your valuable equipment. Protects my laptop as well in a separate compartment. 
24033 excellent extremely good; outstanding. 
24034 A bit heavy but sturdy. 
24035 I don t like the legs because the bottoms always falls off. However, when I tried to return, it charges almost $7, so I guess I will keep it. :( 
24036 My favorite camera. This is the third one I m buying in a row. 
24037 Fab 
24038 Great photos, waterproof. Tough casing. Get it. 
24039 Light and comfortable against the eye. Fit s well but doesn t &#34;click&#34; on and can come off easily. 
24040 Nice set, affordable price! 
24041 Good 
24042 thank u 
24043 All Good A++ 
24044 Go with camkix Unless you want it to say gopro on it 
24045 I bought these as replacement batteries. The work perfect and now I don t have to worry if my battery goes dead when I am taking pictures because I have a backup. 
24046 Very cool little frame, it doesn t have the quality of a computer monitor but it is pretty good. 
24047 Camera was in great shape.instructions were easy to read. 
24048 Fits everything for my camera. The parts do not fit perfectly, but they are all in there and safe. 
24049 I am very happy with this camera. Looks like new. Came with a carry bag and two 16 GB memory cards. Those memory cards are good for pictures but too slow for video with XAVC S format. 
24050 Can t use my camera without this... 
24051 Great bundle, all components work well and very much with the money! In the down side the backpack was not as big as it looks in the picture and the. Inserts are very thin, it took some maneuvering to get my cameras to fit. Still a great kit 
24052 I was having a problem getting my new F19828P camera to work on my laptop, even though it worked on my desktop. I called Foscam and spoke to Calvin and he made some adjustments to the laptop and now everything is operating fine. Foscam tech support is great. 
24053 Battery grip Arrived as promised, best 3rd party battery grip out there. I would recommend this company and grip as excellent. 
24054 on time and well packaged .Still playing with it but so far works great .I may get an extra battery for convience 
24055 Suprising picture quality 
24056 Didnt even last a week the product was so poorly made out of cheap plastic 
24057 I love my new camera 
24058 It did exactly what I wanted it to do. Did not need recharging very frequently. 
24059 A real good add on camera with night vision. Great price too. 
24060 this is a great camera for the average photographer. my wife takes thousands of pictures a year of our grand kids and she then puts them in a shutterfly book. great camera. 
24061 Its ok and could hold all my accessories, but after two few months, the stitching at the zippers came apart. I guess this camera bag insert should not be used without its backpack - [[ASIN:B00J3YFW16 Jill-E Digital 15&#34; Jack Laptop Backpack Case (Brown) with Camera Insert Bag + Cleaning Kit]]. 
24062 didn t work 
24063 They were good and I ll make it so you can reach out and get your camera 
24064 Great product-delivery and service. Very happy with the charger and it arrived hours earlier than expected. Thank you. 
24065 nice 
24066 Good 
24067 perfect!!!!!! 
24068 I love the design and compactness 
24069 great 
24070 It s all ok! 
24071 I used it once and it appears to have charged the batteries that I ordered along with the product. 
24072 love it - 2nd one 
24073 Nice device and yes, it does have an internal single AA battery that can be changed. 
24074 Works as advertised.. 
24075 Handy 
24076 Very satisfied 
24077 I got it 
24078 Excelente 
24079 good 
24080 Battery is working good, but du not have capacity of original ones. 
24081 they work but some of them were already dried out 
24082 The software doesen t recognise the camera and after an hour of capturing videos a transistor exploded and the camera stopped working. 80$ burned out. 
24083 had to return it it didn t have a way to secure the battery for charging 
24084 Love the camera, takes great pictures, and easy to download to print up pictures too. Thank you, 
24085 Is a great camera and does the job very nice. Would absolutely recommend it. 
24086 It really works well, a lot of stuff to figure out but who needs to know everything. 
24087 Perfect fit! 
24088 Camera still doesn t work 
24089 This &#34;small&#34; harness is almost too large for my 60 lb pit bull. Fits my barrel chested boxer pretty well though. 
24090 Works Perfect ! 
24091 Love it !!! Works great !!! 
24092 I m very happy with this item I will buy more 
24093 Very good product at low cost. 
24094 ok 
24095 The Huge grip and feel of this Grip makes me partial to Kupo C-Stands. 
24096 Excellent 
24097 Pelican - what more can one say. Used for a GoPro. Still fitting in accessories. Allows custom fit cut outs. The foam is notched so you have some cutting guide lines. Use a long slender knife to cut the foam along the perforations. 
24098 This product is terrible. It says the product is new strait out of the box but it must have came broken. wouldn t turn on even with a full charge. really upsetting and a waste of money. confusing to use and cheaply made. 
24099 Great camera love it! 
24100 Awesome! 
24101 Well my review is it just don t work well, no instructions, no video, very little sound. For the price it is headed to the trash can. Sorry 
24102 Great price, battery works......I m very pleased with this company s services and I highly recommend 
24103 Thanks, Annemarie C. 
24104 They work great....until they stop working. Slow recycling time on 1/128 power and when fired by the 560 TX is fires full power then shuts down. 
24105 It is very orange. I love it. 
24106 These strobes work great. I am happy with purchase. 
24107 good 
24108 Battery would not charge from the get-go, I have been unable to access the warranty policy, or a phone number for help..... 
24109 This pouch set is well made, protective and stylish. Small size is adequate for pancake lenses and, medium size is good enough for Canon 18-55 STM kit lens. I m still not using the large one but it s nice to have it already for a future lens. 
24110 Works perfectly, shipped promptly, good priçe, 
24111 For the price the product is not bad. 
24112 Great 
24113 Horrible. Does not work well. 
24114 Haven t had to use it but it s there if something goes wrong with my Samsung camera. 
24115 Perfect! Bought these for my sis s wedding and the ones leftover I took with me on a Europe tour! 
24116 wasn t listed that a gender changer was needed 
24117 excellent 
24118 Very Happy 
24119 The camera is great. It s very easy to use and is wonderfully compact. The pictures I took are superb. I highly recommend it. 
24120 im head over heels in love with this camera. And the whole kit for the price is just amazing! Everything is of good quality even thought they re &#34;extras&#34;. I m so happy I made the leap and bought this kit! 
24121 Good product over all. Feels very sturdy on my monopod. 
24122 Does the job for a low price. 
24123 Great camera 
24124 would have been better if i didnt have to buy a hard drive for it... 
24125 great product 
24126 difficult to handle, it is not functional 
24127 Told I needed these for my camera. Seems to help. 
24128 Perfect fit. 
24129 I am totally impressed with this camera. Even the battery lasts indefinitely when it sits without being used. I HIGHLY recommend this camera! 
24130 Great product! 
24131 Cute camera but veery small view finder. Got as a gift for 11 years old. 
24132 Perfect. As promised, but I was surprised at how small the velvet bag was. Didn t know what it was for anyway, so it is still perfect for me. 
24133 Good flash for the price. Plan to use as a second flash when shooting portraits. My only negative is that the user manual is written very poorly. It s difficult to read and sometimes misleading.This flash has 8 custom function settings of which 3 are not mentioned in the manual. 
24134 THIS LENS IS AMAZING. If you were only to have one lens, have this one. The shallow depth of field and low light capability can t be beaten. 
24135 Ok+ 
24136 Thank I used it as soon I get it works very good, thank you! 
24137 DO NOT BUY FROM BESTPRICEAM, PIECES MISSING, NOT WORTH THE TIME TO SEND BACK. 
24138 great one but doenst snap it will keep on turning 
24139 Doesn t work so well in shady areas. Maybe it is the IR blocking filter. So if you re going to be flying through the woods, this isn t the way to go. 
24140 Works like a champ! 
24141 I am very impressed with the results. The product has a great price. and just the Tripod alone was worth the price. Big bang for the buck. 
24142 Fantastic Camera for Construction sites. Easily programmable and takes great time lapse videos 
24143 Extremely fast shipping. Quick and easy installation and programming into my existing 2gig system; all at a fraction of the purchase/installation offered by a security systems installer. 
24144 I ordered a dark brown frame and received a black frame 
24145 Looks very realistic. Cheaply made, but once they are mounted, that should not be an issue. 
24146 Great Product 
24147 Actually my wife loves it. I just carry the camera bag. 
24148 Great drone. Yes its an older model but I have already captured some amazing vids and pics with it and will be using it for my upcoming school project. 
24149 didn t work with any of my speedlites. 
24150 very good material 
24151 Wonderful bag very nice to have a large compartment that doesn t collapse. 
24152 Easy to direct ligh, hold shapes 
24153 This product is great hooked it to my go pro and love it! 
24154 Very good experience! Would recommend this seller always! 
24155 Works well, makes for a solid base and is easy to get on-off. 
24156 Great product. Fast shipping. 
24157 Bought this to pair with my Sony a6000 and it works well! I ve been taking pictures of plants and insects and you ve got to get realllllly close, but the detail is fantastic. The only drawback:The aluminum casing scratches VERY easily. 
24158 This camera was ok but does not do well in low light conditions. 
24159 Love it 
24160 Awesome. Great price. Fit my sons camera perfectly. Durable and long lasting. 
24161 This is exactly what I hoped it would be. Fits everything in for the drone and a few extras so I don t have to lug another bag along. 
24162 Very loud and light weight ! I ll take it on all my runs and everywhere I go. I won t leave home without it... 
24163 excellent 
24164 I ordered the expert shield and it was delivered in three days, that was with standard shipping, great service. the shield fits perfectly, couldn t ask for a better fit. the price is very reasonable for this kind of quality. racinsailor 
24165 the trade name was not neewer. 
24166 The product arrived on time and it was just what I needed. Would buy again. 
24167 On time. As described. 
24168 Works fantastic! I love controlling all my speedlights from one place. 
24169 My dropcam pro stopped working and the Nest company replaced it for me free. Very supportive and reliable company and the new cam works brilliantly. The company was very responsive and quick with their service. Thanks Nest! So I have bought another cam. 
24170 good camera for its purpose 
24171 Very satisfied 
24172 I m unimpressed with the feel of this. It doesn t hold he phone straight for a larger phone. It s very expensive for what it is and doesn t seem it will last. 
24173 Purchased to go with the Uniden system I purchase from Costco that only had two cameras. This synced perfectly with it and works really well. Good night vision too. 
24174 So far so good. GoPro Hero black consumes batteries to fast so it is good for moments where you cant find any other ellectrical source. 
24175 I bought a total of 4, I like them! 
24176 It really is an awful piece. The camera itself is OK tough the stand is bizarre and difficult to use as is the focus on the camer. The Software is junk 
24177 Great lens, amazing for landscape and night time photography 
24178 terrible quality cloth 
24179 This camera is great for action shots and has a lot of extras for enhancing pictures. The extra battery pack and SD cards were a bonus that was great to have. 
24180 I love this, I basically wanna take it everywhere. READ HOW TO ADJUST YOUR ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING BEFORE TAKING YOUR PICTURES. If they come out horrible, it s cause you did it wrong. 
24181 expected better resolution. 
24182 Works perfectly and came on time. 
24183 Ok 
24184 Nothing is broken so far, havent set it up yet but will whenever i have time 
24185 Cool 
24186 This camera has a very nice option you can select, I think it s called the &#34;beauty or beautiful&#34; mode, basically a soft version of portrait photo shop. People always say before your ready to take their, &#34;make me look young and beautiful&#34; this camera does that. Very nice. 
24187 Piece of junk. Does not work. Do not buy. 
24188 Just replaced one failed WANSVIEW CAM after two years with this one. Image is much better. I have not tested memory card yet. Hope it will work and last longer. 
24189 Great bag, fits a lot of equipment. Handy for water environments. 
24190 Great I will buy more 
24191 Well made. Would buy again. 
24192 hard to figure out how to use for the average person 
24193 As advertised 
24194 To start with, the canvas boxes in which they come are the poorest quality posible. The packege i got, did not include the bateríes. 
24195 works well for good price, sellers contacted me immediately after to let me know there is a warranty and to make sure there were no problems. 
24196 Excelente... 
24197 fits perfectly, as to be expected from OEM items 
24198 Keeps the GoPro clipped in and the mount is tight. It is not going anywhere. 
24199 Brought this to use w/JOTO 6-inch Waterproof Case pouch, for family & everyone LOVED THIS GIFT!!! 
24200 Very good item! I will purchase another soon...it s worth the money. Pictures are clear, I added a ring light to increase lighting and it help too. 
24201 We ll see. I purchased this to replace a unit that fail from a different manufacturer. So far, so good. I will update in time if needed. 
24202 This has been a great camera which is very easy to use and takes great pictures. Larger than the ones that slip in a pocket but that s not a problem for me. 
24203 Great tool for converting slides to digital images. Get one and pass it around your family. You ll probably only use it once but the time it saves and the memories you recover are worth it. 
24204 Much of the film either didn t develop or developed very, very slowly (we re talking hours). Kind of a bummer for the high price. 
24205 Fits all the standard GoPro Accessories. Worth the money. Good construction an good foam. 
24206 This item is a excellent piece of equipment,the size was perfect to fit my camera and cellphone. 
24207 love it 
24208 Very good picture quality, just a little overheat when u transfer picture to smartphone 
24209 What can one expect for so little money. Recommend spending the extra cash to purchase a higher quality tube kit. 
24210 It did not work. 
24211 These microprism screens are wonderful -- I put them in my EOS 1N/1V, and I love working with them. 
24212 A good solid camera for our son (11). He has used it at home and at camp and it s lasted through it all! Great pictures and lots of memories. 
24213 I lost the center column of my 190 tripod on a shoot and needed to replace it and this was the perfect solution. Works great. 
24214 Very easy to install, great video quality, strong wifi connection, love that it zooms in and out and pans smoothly, totally worth the price. Been through two other wifi monitors and I was so upset with those but now I m happy with this! 
24215 LOVE IT!!! 
24216 Seems as though it will work well though no real trial use of product yet. 
24217 Good concert binoculars. Some might find them a little heavy after awhile but I paired them with a Monopod and there perfect. 
24218 Worked and fit great for my camera. Best underwater photos taken...No filmy look on the images from the case. 
24219 Foam doesn t seem to fit the drone perfectly, but good enough. 
24220 Terrible terrible menu. Borderline retarded. Very expensive prime lenses. Fast. Hunts for focus while doing video though... 
24221 This is a Great Tripod! I put my Leica T62 Spotting scope on it and at the range or in the field it is great. I have killed many Coyotes and Rabbits using it to spot or as a rest. It is Killin Machine! Get one!! 
24222 Works just like the Nikon battery. 
24223 thanks 
24224 Image and construction quality are great! 
24225 Patrick Good service from Patrick and 5 stars rating for this service good quality of camera 
24226 Great for the price. 
24227 arrived and didnt work. 
24228 Bought a new camera with two lenses. For one I had a bunch of filters from my old 35mm, but the other was incompatible, so I ordered this pack to help in the field. So far, great results. 
24229 This is an excellent addition to the pro 40 - 150 and given the price and weight, makes for a 420mm f4 in a small package compared with anything else available. Optical quality is also excellent. 
24230 Great 
24231 Versatile, but not intuitive. Tendency to not be able to fully capture batteries. I have to secure then to the charger with a rubber band. 
24232 Worked for two years, then zippers ripped out. 
24233 Great when I m shooting concerts. Two thumbs up. 
24234 I m enjoying my new charger for my camera. No more dead batteries. 
24235 Good quality, great value. We ve been having difficulty charging the batteries and have to keep them plugged in almost constantly. We will likely be contacting the seller for assistance in the near future. 
24236 All hail the D-76, King of the developers. 
24237 The tripod doesn t fit in the camera case, that why it comes with its own carrying case. I like the whole kit. No complaints. 
24238 Fast service great product 
24239 Very good camera, fast shooting in any luminosity, easy to configure, small and confortable to handle. The only problem is the lack of a lens cap. For this we have to be always careful not to touch or let the lens touch anything. 
24240 love it. husband wears glasses and can bird watch from his chair, 
24241 Great Product 
24242 Excellent product and excellent service. 
24243 Does the trick. Protects the lens. A must-have for a nice lens. 
24244 It s awesome 
24245 Great for action videos such as bike riding skateboarding, etc 
24246 Sharp broad field of view. A little pricy but better than the cheap zoom models. 
24247 The cap works great. I would buy again. 
24248 broke after 3 months 
24249 Great product, has never scratched any lens I have used them on. 
24250 I have enjoyed using my Canary and watching it evolve. Customer satisfaction is paramount to these guys, so it is not done evolving. I am thouroughly satisfied and can t wait to see some of the up and coming features! 
24251 Does not come with clip accessory to put gopro on, need to buy that separate. 
24252 I wanted something I could strap my gorpo too that would float so when I brought it to the beach it wouldn t sink. So far in the pool it does just that and the added wrist strap is awesome so it doesn t float away. 
24253 Did the job, the price was right. 
24254 I needed a sports wifi cam asap for a trip and I got this camera on time for my trip. The camera works great, no issues. Will order again from this seller!!!! Great job :) 
24255 Very useful. 
24256 Pretty awesome product. Lenses fit perfectly. Couldn t be happier. 
24257 Since I live in a more urban area, these come in handy as I m always trying to sneak in a small or regular. They are very water proof, so the logs will stay dry without a baggie. Overall, really great product, I would buy it again! 
24258 High end feel. Protects well. Never loosens, much easier to keep clean than other UV filters that I own. 
24259 great tripod 
24260 Great 
24261 Horrible video quality not practical 
24262 Works as expected! 
24263 Tested it right away in water for an extended period before using it with camera. I hope to take it snorkeling this fall. 
24264 Spy camera. Looks pretty nice. The output is alright, not that great but I am not choosy 
24265 Good ++++ 
24266 Fast service. Satisfied. 
24267 I love it 
24268 4 years later and I still love this camera 
24269 Very good versatile lens. 
24270 Item delivered on time, was as described 
24271 Love my camera except for the fact it came with instructions in Japanese, or chineses, or Korean..... they were everything but English 
24272 Fast service, quality items 
24273 very pleased with both the charger and the batteries 
24274 Love! So adorable. 
24275 Photographs great, doesn t wrinkle. Wish I was a little bigger 
24276 Have not used much other than the batteries and chargers. Others have said hard to get out of charger. I found it quite ready. Love having the extra chargers while away from outlets. Great luxury to have! 
24277 Strong and versatile. A must! You can, of course, combine it with various camera, tablet or smartphone holder. My regret about this one: not getting one or two sooner. Seriously! 
24278 Three of the items were NOT what was pictured, and were of significantly lower quality. I returned it. 
24279 Great lens for the money buy now before the price increases. 
24280 blast 
24281 Works just as good as the original. 
24282 Great. 
24283 This works well for my son s Sony camera. 
24284 terrible. I do not recommend. the flash is late and doesn t supply a clear image 
24285 Perfect camera replacement cord 
24286 Great, 
24287 Works as advertised. For long exposure photos, you would want to use in lower light conditions. But the colors come out good and it works as it should. 
24288 It was as expected. Worked fine. 
24289 Won t keep the right setting very hard to get programmed very disappointed with this item. 
24290 The cameras offer a very poor picture during daylight hours. The cameras also get hot for some odd reason. I removed them from my system to prevent any issues. I have other HD-CVI cameras that offer a better picture. Do not spend you money on these. 
24291 Great camera - replacement for ZS40 on which we shot about 40,000 photos! 
24292 Everything was as promised. Thanks! 
24293 I bought for my daughter for Christmas and she seems to love it. 
24294 Good value for cheap price, works fine, but while the flattening is space efficient, the assembly is fussy. 
24295 Very cool product. 
24296 I have both the small and medium bag and love them both. 
24297 Don t waste your money on this one unless you can live with terrible video quality. There is no way this is a 720P camera. Spend the extra money and get a 9805P that has excellent video 
24298 Good 
24299 Great macro for my GoPro Hero 4 Silver. Awesome quality and comes with a little tether and Amazing bag for it. Perfect 
24300 thanks 
24301 Was very shocked at first that it held very well to my windshield, just have other problems with various suction mounts. Will buy another one soon to mount in the back of my cab. 
24302 I love this bag! Fits my camera and accessories perfectly!! And it is bigger than I expected, bonus!! 
24303 I Found my own ways to Hook the gopro onto my bike comfortably and stable. They seemed like a solid idea. 
24304 Its a great tool but has to be treated with great care as the top rotating part can easily break off. 
24305 I used this for my g3 wireless mics. It s an affordable case that adds protection and professionalism. 
24306 Camera was easy to operate and waterproof. Picture quality was good, but not great. 
24307 works great! 
24308 Very great batteries! They last for 6 hours each on my Sony CX900 
24309 I have not had the opportunity to use much yet, but happy with what I ve done so far. 
24310 good thank you 
24311 got this for my girlfriend and she loves it. if she s happy with it, i m happy with it. 
24312 Very good for price. 
24313 When it is finally set up it works great. But Foscam had to screen share my computer to get it set up. Way too complicated! 
24314 Excellent! 
24315 Case was as advertised,strong,roomy,except for the prop guards,but I m satisfied! 
24316 Very nice monocular , I like it and clear and a lot better than the other one I have which is a 10 power and 42 mm 
24317 Thanks 
24318 Works great! 
24319 You can carry a bunch of stuff not related to the camera. Passport, money and other documents. I see it as kind of a man s purse. 
24320 Works like a camera lens should 😏 
24321 The strap is short, wish it was longer. 
24322 good deal 
24323 Shipped and arrived quickly. The product is exactly as explained and fits my lense perfectly. Thanks for the great buy at an affordable price! 
24324 So far so good! We ll see how the quality is and how it functions underwater when we take our upcoming trip. 
24325 It s cheap, it works. Doesn t have the non-reflective felt lining that the genuine Canon hood has, but I can t complain for the price. 
24326 The best camera addition I have purchased. The grip holds two batteries. I love it 
24327 very tight first few uses, but improves to sturdy fit as flexed to the shape of your speedlight. super cheap and effective - thumbs up. 
24328 This is great 400 speed film and very reasonably priced. I like it in TMax developer. 
24329 There s not much to say about this battery that hasn t already been said. It works as a great replacement for the more expensive batteries and I can t tell the difference. 
24330 Power 2000 ACD-235 Replacement for Casio NP-40. This product rocks!!! I take a lot of pictures with my camera and now no matter what I have a charged battery ready to go. The charge stay longer and it is easy!Thanks 
24331 This kit is AWESOME! I can t believe how well everything works. Everything fits into the pouch and it slips onto the strap of my camera bag. 
24332 Lost the little black piece to cover the SD card... the rest helped too 
24333 Was exactly what I expected 
24334 The camera looks amazingly real, with red flashing light and the wires coming from back. 
24335 Very prompt fulfillment. Tremendous deal vs. normal retail. Very satisfied 
24336 exelent 
24337 This backpack has changed my level of orginization, and comfertablity with my equipment. All around best bagg out in the market. Its a must have. 
24338 Very good deal for all these items... Everything works great! 
24339 Arrived earlier than expected and product is as advertised. 
24340 This is awesome product 
24341 The really is a great starter kit. Using the tripod/monopod with my intro Canon DSLR worked great. I never worried about the tripod falling over or anything. But it is definitely for beginners. 
24342 We bought this for a gift and pre-loaded pictures of the kids on it. We liked it so much that we re ordering one for ourselves. 
24343 Good solid bag, got it on sale so it was a good buy... 
24344 I have 3 of them since 2013. They re all still working. On 2 of my car and 1 of my motorcycle. 
24345 Limited field of view. Past event vowing very cumbersome. Night vision useless. Merely just a webcam if that 
24346 Very nicely made case. We have not put it to use yet, but will soon. 
24347 clarity is great 
24348 the hood can be a problem ,it can go on crooked which show up in the photo 
24349 Great 
24350 Really bright. Don t look into light. Get the diffusion cover. Must get Sony type battery separately to use light. Bluer than sunlight. Works well with reflector umbrella. Brightness is adjustable. 
24351 Works perfect on my Nikon DSLR 5100. 
24352 They didn t provide how to sync the device. I called the manufacturer and they wanted to charge me $50 for the answer. 
24353 I love this pack. It does all I wanted it to do. 
24354 Recommended 100 % excellent product 
24355 Perfect. 
24356 great but instructions were in chinesse 
24357 Cheap and good quality 
24358 so far so good 
24359 QUICK SERVICE ,GOOD QUALITY 
24360 Ordered the camera on Tuesday and received it today. Very fast shipping. Took some pics with it and works awesome and take great pics so far. 
24361 Excellent product. 
24362 Very good. Easy to unpack and easy to install. 
24363 Great security system doing the job that we need it for 
24364 The CMS software too complicated,I don`t know how to use,can you updated more easily and simply version? 
24365 I like GGS products, so I m fully satisfied wit this one too. It fits my camera s screen perfectly. Easy installation and great look. 
24366 Don t buy it! Waste of money!!!!! 
24367 It works good but broke after 3 events. Good temporary solution though. 
24368 The product was amazing everything works perfectly nice and intact shipping was almost immediate ! 
24369 Sturdy clips. 
24370 I have a Kodak Pixpro and lost my original case. Tight inside but it works. This is definitely for small cameras. The zippered pockets are also tight and cannot hold much but it worked for the charger cord during my recent vacation. The price was also very good. 
24371 I was a little wary at first buying this for my Sony nex 3n but it works fine! I use it for my 18-55mm lens and it s great! 
24372 For the price I paid, it s excellent. I like it and have no regrets. I recommend it 
24373 At this price point this is a great filter. I have severals B+W filters and I think this one has the same quality. 
24374 Outstanding!! 
24375 I have purchased several accessories this year for my new Nikkon d3200 camera this year. Each item s quality has been excellent and functions as described. Also, each item included a lens cloth. Would not be concerned at all about purchasing items from this seller. 
24376 500 slides in 4 hours and works as advertised, now its a paper weight. I will sell it for 80 bucks! 
24377 I bought this to use as a baby monitor and could not be happier. An underrated feature of the Nest Cam is the night vision. It s amazing and the set up is incredibly easy. 
24378 Perfect for theatre, clear and easy to focus. 
24379 Excellent item, poor internal Memory, but all good. 
24380 Great case. Pelican or nothing. 
24381 This unit was bad from the start, would not hover, always moves down or up and to the side 
24382 good kit 
24383 Didn t have the correct parts with this product 
24384 Great, affordable, professional variable filter. The slider ring is a bit wonky, but for the price a great buy. Use it on my Sigma 18 - 35 f/1.8. Helps me stay wide open when I need it. 
24385 Excellent 
24386 Just what we needed! 
24387 Perfect.... Easy to fit everything needed... And keep everything protected! 
24388 Worked perfectly. I recommend it. Top craftsmanship. Bought several rolls, All rolls performed at 100%. Quality Control at 100% too. I will buy again from this vendor for sure. Happy customer = repeat business!!!!!!!! 
24389 charge doesn t seem to last very long. 
24390 Excellent kit has all advertised items and seem to be very good quality. The case is perfect, all items fit in it and looks to be excellent quality. The kit has just about everything a person needs to keep camera and lens clean which will provide very high qualtiy photos. 
24391 Excellent, works like a champ, fits my camera (Thank you to all the other buyers who answered all my questions) and I received it so fast I was able to take it on vacation! 
24392 This is a great item to have on hand 
24393 so so 
24394 Freaking awesome! Love this product! 
24395 Good 
24396 I have ordered a new one. But the box was opened, display was dirty and user manual was missing. I have returned it on the same day. 
24397 It works perfectly! I am very happy with it!! 
24398 my daughter loves this camera 
24399 Works in my old Kodak C743. I am thrilled. It arrived quickly and as described. 
24400 looks exaclty as it is pictured here. havent used it yet but cant wait to. looks very heavy duty. 
24401 Excellent and excellent customer service. Highly recommended. 
24402 I know FLIR makes some amazing products but a thermal imaging unit for an iPhone??? Who would believe it? Well this actually works - and quite well. Software easy to load. Easy to set up and use. You can change the image coloration for different situations. I am truly amazed. 
24403 Haven t been able to use it yet but for the price you can t go wrong. 
24404 Just got these for my Nikkor 55-300 Lense and they are a great value and were quickly shipped. 
24405 Well made, I took my ripped neewer sandbags that came with the boom are and just stuffed them right inside. No complaints. 
24406 This is awesome for indoor photography. I can take photos indoors without using flash. What else would you want? 
24407 Really love d it! Something in what you can really make an investment. 
24408 Breathed new life into my Canon 1D Classics! unbeatable price and quality! 
24409 Worked as expected 
24410 I love it. 
24411 covers the lens just fine. 
24412 Shut the camera on and off and starts and stops the recording well. Zooming starts at one speed than goes super fast for the second half of the zoom. Why? Cheap electronics. Spend little money and you get cheap crap. Look for another. 
24413 Very fun to play with 
24414 My iPhone took better pics. Not kidding 
24415 Price is right, and it works fine. 
24416 Was too large and bulky for my purposes - it was a nice bag and well done but not for my situation. Returned with Amazon no hassle return. 
24417 lovely 
24418 I bought this for my 17 year old for her birthday. She loves it! It s retro, but easy to use. The Fugifilm Instax Accessory Bundle Set is a Must Have ! It s also easy to get film for. 
24419 Does what it s supposed to do! 
24420 Case is a little big for my camera, but it is well protected and has compartments for the charger and anything else you might need. 
24421 tried to get in touch with company know one answer the telephone. tried 3 times. my uniden wireless video surveillance will not record just brought it in MAY THIS YEARhttps://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41GID61XwkL._SS300_.jpg 
24422 Love this light, works great, well built! 
24423 This little thing will change my videography experience completely. 
24424 Good Fast service and as advertised. 
24425 Beware the firmware updates... mine fell out of the sky after the most recent update... moral of the story is if you have a firmware that works just stick with it and don t update. Worked amazing before that though... 
24426 Best purchase I have ever made :) I ve used it in so many vacations already! Perfect underwater pics! 
24427 item is as described by seller, reach on time. no problem so far...recommended seller and product 
24428 Works well, however if you zoom into scene, this doesn t show you your new &#34;frame&#34;. 
24429 Everything fits perfect in the bag. 
24430 Very comfort, very good size if you have children and need to carry their stuff and your slrs. 
24431 love love love my green screen! 
24432 Very high quality product. It has a cover for the LCD screen AND the control panel. Difficult to tell that it is even installed! 
24433 A great buy! 
24434 Good size for all you spare parts and gear. My 2 go pro fit great and plenty of cut out. 
24435 Great clarity and viewing anglle. Works wonderfully at night as well. IR have even assisted an older camera I have as a backup to this one. 
24436 So far this has been a great replacement battery. I will probably buy another one. It charged up just fine and so far has been flawless. 
24437 Just getting to know this wonderful camera. So far it is flawless. 
24438 We use these to watch birds at our feeder. My wife just loves them. They are easy to focus, use, and store. I am glad we made the purchase.. 
24439 Red light never stops blinking, but works as intended - A deterrent. 
24440 The battery was exhausted after using it two times. Learned this while on vacation. 
24441 No memory stick was included though it is listed!! Very bad 
24442 Excellent product! Very satisfied with the quality and prompt delivery. 
24443 Great filter, exactly as I expected. Most likely will buy a couple more.... 
24444 Great Service! Great Price on a very good camera! Arrived ahead of time 
24445 Great bag! wish the top was big enough to hold a laptop though 
24446 I like the design of the camera. The packing is very safety, without any damage to the camera. 
24447 Good Product 
24448 nice product, quick delivered, good description 
24449 Works excellent keeps my cam from fogging up. Fits well without messing up the case. 
24450 I like it because you can fly inside without hurting the house, kids, pets, or quad copter itself, too badly. 
24451 Batteries work really well. :-) received products timely. Thanks 
24452 All is well. I am happy with with the items purchased from this seller. However, I didn t catch the writing that said that it only extends 8&#34;.... I was under the impression that it was 18&#34;....guess there was a smudge on my eye glasses!! 
24453 nice bag for camera 
24454 Excellent beginner camera! 
24455 works great, but hard to close cover and can t see display on GoPro 4 Silver.... small block should be moved to other end of line than it would be perfect 
24456 Excellent product. Excellent transaction. 
24457 This camera is in perfect condition and works great. 
24458 I bought 3 pairs. I have tried to use 2 so far. Each box had a faulty locking mechanism on one of the stands. It would not support the Arlo in a fixed position. I am going to have to epoxy the ball in order to make it work properly. 
24459 Received a day early, thanks. I know where I will shop for my security needs in the future. 
24460 Works great. Auto open feature is nice. It fit my NX Mini very well. It is perfect for protecting the lens when not in use, and you don t have to take it off to take photo s. 
24461 I brought this on a road trip out west and it performed beautifully. It s funny how close you have to get to the subject to &#34;zoom&#34; in on them. I adore this lens! 
24462 I really like the trigger I have a Canon 600ex and a Yongnuo 600ex flash. It works great with both and has a added a new dimension to my flash photography. 
24463 I love the camera. It does everything they promised. Very clear picture and set up was very easy!! Loved it!! 
24464 I used this for one day,then this thing broke 
24465 The price couldn t be better for this all-manual flash, especially if you re new to using off-camera flash equipment. Being forced to use manual settings will teach you more in 10 minutes than anything. I love this guy and ll be buying more! 
24466 Product did not connect wirelessly at all. Worked with hardwire but free web viewing was primitive. I expected a whole lot more from Samsung 
24467 Excellent does what it says. 
24468 Outstanding Item and fast shipping. 
24469 Very helpful to tighten and loosen the camera mount. Recommended! 
24470 Really enjoying the camera. Optical zoom is incredible. 
24471 Smooth as butter once you learn how to handle it. There will be some delay in response when the spinning wheels have to change direction, but once you get used to it, the smoothest tracking shots will be yours! 
24472 Very good bundle. 
24473 Great telescope&#34; 
24474 They work perfectly fine for my cam. Needed a charger and extra batteries and nice that the bill for the price they are awesome. 
24475 Waste of money. The ink does not disappear, it just loses color, from blue to light grey, but everything can be read. 
24476 No trouble, its working, every thing its OK. 
24477 works well and has nice features 
24478 great! help a lot 
24479 I asked if this battery would fit the Geekpro cameras and received 2 responses, one person did not know and the other stated that it would NOT. Well, it fits perfectly, works great and came about 90% charged! I would (and probably will) buy more! 
24480 This flash is equivalent to the canon alternative at a fraction of the cost. I have used it for events and weddings and may never bu Canon flashes again. 
24481 So much fun to share these pictures w/ friends and family! 
24482 It s great in the sunshine. it can t perform well under low light situation... I can t even take photo in a japanese sushi bar with this lens.. I use my f4 lens instead in such situation. 
24483 I bought it together with Eye-fi mobi 8GB SD card for my Nikon D300. It works and I am happy with it. 
24484 Did fine under water 
24485 Buy genuine always if you want it to last for 3 years with no worries. 
24486 Incredible camera, prints very good quality photos. Doesn t come with an SD card so can only store about 16 photos at a time, but fantastic besides that. Ability to change exposure / etc really makes this a step up from an instax 
24487 Both batteries hold charge and were delivered quickly. 
24488 Great binos. I ve used for both for general and bird watching. These are very good for lower light situations. 
24489 a 
24490 It s a battery. It works. Charge seems just as good as the Canon batteries 
24491 Very cute print, doesn t look cheap. Very trustworthy on my canon rebel 
24492 Works as advertised. 
24493 These plastic &#34;filters&#34; I knew would be on the margins of uselessness, and I was not disappointed. They attach poorly to the camera, increase distortion and reduce light transmission, and don t really filter out the wavelengths that they are intended to filter. Don t waste your money. 
24494 An amazing lens that every camera owner should have. A great value because the price includes lots of extras. Speedy delivery, nicely packed. Thanks! 
24495 Great film, but I wish it was a bit cheaper for returning customers. 
24496 No issues does the job. 
24497 An excellent companion to the FZ-1000 
24498 Super light you can throw it on your shoulder and forget its even there. Not the most comfortable but is the most convenient. Would not recommend for sitting a long time. 
24499 Love it! This lightening has changed my professional look to the too of the list. My videos want be the same without it! Thanks :) 
24500 Very nice and comfortable sling bag. As described. Improvements could be a rain cover and a large pocket at the back to fit my iPod mini. I use my mini to review my pictures so it s always with me. 
24501 Closes tighter than my original gopro case. Works great with the cut out for my mic. 
24502 Great Great 
24503 just as described,,thanks 
24504 it works 
24505 Excellent oversize MagicFiber screen pack. Perfect for my huge laptop screen, multiple desktop monitors and also for our HD TV screen. Would gladly buy again from this seller! 
24506 Love this product. The camera and cable fits perfect. The directions were simple and installation was a breeze. I was concerned about the sound quality, but much to my surprise, it was outstanding. I love it so much I just ordered a second case. 
24507 I think that these batteries might be better than the Pentax originals. 
24508 Worked great for reversing the polarization of the lcd display on my motorcycle. Now it s black with white numbers. Looks awesome! 
24509 Excellent product with great service response from the vendor. 
24510 I used the head strap while climbing a mountain. I really got some great shots, allowing me capture the entire event seemlessly. 
24511 nice camera great price 
24512 Great camera especially for the price. Had lots of accessories with it too. Have been using for a few weeks and have not had any issues. Not sure why people would spend 10x s as much for the name brand version. 
24513 Quick response, product quality is excellent. 
24514 Good product. 
24515 I love this camera. very easy to operate. 
24516 This is awesome for teenagers and super simple to connect. I wish it would come with more paper. I have not priced how much it is to get extras but my teens loved this!!! 
24517 Fit was perfect and a great replacement to the original. 
24518 2 bulbs and 1 stand did not work. Very cheaply made. 
24519 Great and quality product. I have been using it for years now. 
24520 Item worked perfectly! Great pictures and video. 
24521 I dive very often and this filter system is extremely handy. The photo/videos are much more vibrant and having the option to switch to a different filter ensures your photos come out amazing. Two thumbs up and a 5 star from me. 
24522 Just wished there was an updated version of this with VR. Other than that it works fine. 
24523 Very smooth operation. For the price it is as good as it gets 
24524 This combination of two batteries and a charger was less than half the cost of one battery from a conventional store. 
24525 Very good products, but the floating handle is not completely sealed. On the last trip some water has entered inside it. 
24526 Not bad for the price 
24527 I have not flown it yet but all put together it feels very solid. I would rate five stars but there was no instructions and I had a little bit of difficulties putting g it together mostly my fault also there is no Allen wrench included which sucked. 
24528 VERY happy with this camcorder! The video and the stills come out clear. Amazing package for the price. Will recommend it to my entire Video class at school. 
24529 This bag fits everything I need it to fit. Very durable! 
24530 I had them for couple of month and started to fade. Not a good buy 
24531 Handy camera. Great Zoom ability. Its easy to switch from still to video. 
24532 i love my fuji camera and the film is easy enough to just drop in and shoot. 
24533 Arrived on time and worked well 
24534 Just as described - arrived on time and works perfectly. 
24535 more POWER MOAR POWUR 
24536 The carrier is well made, it holds the film flat with little loss of the image. 
24537 Works great! 
24538 Love, love, love! Cute and easy to use. Took a bit of practice to get used to the settings but I love the surprise on how the picture turns out. 
24539 It s a great solution to recharge Sony 7R batteries. 
24540 Love this for gopro....always have a batt ready! 
24541 I m so pleased with the camera and the speedily delivery! Great doing business with, I highly recommend! 
24542 i spoke with Danny today he was very helpful in explaining and setting up my camera i give hi 2 thumbs up tanks Danny 
24543 Good quality but don t stays in place, I bought this one for my iPad and I can t make that Stick on, poor quality adhesive. Disappointed!!! 
24544 i thebitems on time and was pleased. 
24545 Great camera! Excellent underwater photos. 
24546 Charged up great and have been using them with no difficulties! 
24547 The hood works great. Awesome lens hood, fits perfect and tight on the lens. I would recommend this hood. 
24548 Fits well! That s all you need really. 
24549 This is a decent remote. It just is really really small and feels kind of chintzy. But the price was right, so it ll do! 
24550 best half-case ever! grippy, lightweight, well-crafted! J.B. is the best...just when I thought the bamboo & walnut grips were great! 
24551 beautiful made and great results 
24552 Didn t love the results I had with this, but to be fair, I didn t test it out for very long before deciding I didn t want to keep it. 
24553 A+++++ 
24554 Not worth it. Daughter was excited to get it but after a few hours lost interest. 
24555 Perfect for our news show!!!! 
24556 does not fit! 
24557 Good quality and value. 
24558 So nice. All the items made the gift even bettwr 
24559 Batteries work great and saved a ot of money over the Canon brand. I am hoping the maintain their current change ability in the future too. 
24560 I have had issues with the stand in this set. The rest seems to be ok, but the stand keeps falling apart. Not high quality 
24561 Excellent APS-C sensor paired with a beautifully crafted 28mm (equiv) lens results in fantastic images. It s compact and unobtrusive. Perfect for street photography but it performed well on a cityscape sunset photoshoot. I d certainly recommend this product. 
24562 Very cheap. Broke on first use 
24563 Lasted about a year. Worked great in the meantime! 
24564 Excellent for sending power + video to remote cameras using cheap cat5e cable I got cheaply at a thrift store. 
24565 Perfect 
24566 Very good!!! 
24567 For a photography maniac comes in super handy. Charges fast. Has been in use for about 3 months now, and i charge them about once or twice a week. So far have not observed reduced battery lifetime. 
24568 GREAT PRODUCT 
24569 Excelentttttttttt 
24570 Use for protect my NX500 camera, looks amazing, pretty vintage and always at hand. Remember my grandpa s camera. 
24571 Great product 
24572 Have a Nikon D3300. Only received one of the two lens cap keepers, but even if I received the second one, probably wouldn t use it. Fell off rather quickly. Need better adhesive. Lens cap fit perfectly, and the HeroFiber cloths are amazing. 
24573 Outstanding Item and fast shipping. 
24574 doesnt hurt my neck at all 
24575 Great! 
24576 very hard to adjust 
24577 Gift for husband, he loves it! 
24578 Held like iron. Pleased. 
24579 These are great, hold two light stands, and other bits inside. The only thing I don t like about them is they take a couple I weeks to get them, but I have ordered them twice now. I think they are worth the wait. 
24580 Perfect 
24581 I bought this camera for vacation, I went threw 3 sets of batteries within 75 pics. The camera will not power off unless the batteries are removed. Not the best picture quality either. Keep shopping. 
24582 Had them now for two and half years and they are working great, they keep the charge capacity very good. 
24583 Sun shade is visible when not zoomed. 
24584 Sticky tape doesnt last. Otherwise the picture quality is great. Using it for USPSA shooting matches. Works awesome. 
24585 very happy with product 
24586 I like these cameras, they are doing their job. I already had 2 so I bought 2 more from amazon 
24587 Exactly like the one that came with our camera. Now we have a spare. 
24588 This only worked briefly before it just quit working. It was a cheap option I went with and ended up having to spend more money on another one. I should have not skimp on quality just to save money 
24589 It s great for nigh macro photography. 
24590 Nice cheap replacement to old camcorder had laying around 
24591 I didn t like not like this product very much. The material felt in-considerably cheap for the cost of the item., the album is very hard and stiff which makes it difficult to flip through the pages. Additionally, the pages after regular use start to detach. 
24592 Great batteries for the price 
24593 Just perfect! Thank you! Works great! 
24594 Fits and chatges perfectly 
24595 Used this for a wedding guest book alternative and the guests loved it! 
24596 Understanding the manual is not easy. 
24597 Works perfectly 
24598 Listed as a micro 4/3 adapter but when I revived the item, its for T2 adapter. 
24599 Can t be beat for the price, this is a professional grade monopod for the videographer on a budget with a very smooth pan & tilt...great product!!! 
24600 this works surprisingly well with my P520 camera. I m just mad i didn t buy it sooner. 
24601 Excellent quality, fast charger, they fit snugly but perfectly. 
24602 Quite expensive but works really well. 
24603 Awesome !!! 
24604 Small, but mighty. I carry it in my pocket when on excursions. 
24605 Really works well can t tell the difference 
24606 Excellent little camera but a bit difficult to program. Went online for help and found different opinions mostly negative to the programing. After many atemps, finally got it to work and I am happy with it. 
24607 Great service and product. 
24608 This was a purchase for myself and I have found it as advertised and a good purchase. The seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with. 
24609 Works very well & I would purchase again from this company. 
24610 don t try to recharge these with an auto charger cord or adapter plug! it will actually drain the battery. 
24611 After two years, still can t access remotely. One of the cameras went from color to black and white after a year. 
24612 I used it in the Caribbean and I m totally happy that I bought it... 
24613 Wasn t happy with the camera at all 
24614 Great! 
24615 Will return to seller. 
24616 Free charger and battery, what a deal, why buy &#34;GoPro&#34; when you can get same product for a fraction of the cost. 
24617 Quick delivery and excellent products 
24618 Simple design, easy to use, and saves me money. I had two different people ask me to look at it because both had lost their GoPro s in the surf and had to buy new cameras. 
24619 Not what you expect.....very cheap and honestly should have a recall!!!! How do I return this? 
24620 It s a good charger everything came in great. The car charger is awesome as well. Overall great product. I was a bit skeptical buying it but it met all my expectations 
24621 This lens hood fits perfectly on two lenses and seems to good provide good protection from stray light, preventing flare. Works great! 
24622 loved it.....specially the sensor....my guests enjoy it very much! 
24623 works great when you remember to take it with you. LOL 
24624 Works fine. 
24625 Works great for what it is. 
24626 I was excited to get but I was a little disappointed when I got it 
24627 When I put my phone and hold it, it doesn t feel sturdy. It feels like it is missing something to hold it together. 
24628 Only got one like everyone else s review... and my roommate purchased these through my recommendation and she only got two.. But they sent me the 4 pack right away! 
24629 There are alternate option available for lesser price when you compare the quality of this product 
24630 My son s a photographer and he loved this product! 
24631 Awesome, better than what I could have imagined!!!! 
24632 Didn t work with my d3200 
24633 Thanks 
24634 Fits the camera all right, comfortable to use. 
24635 Love it 
24636 It was perfect ,arrived extremely late lol but product was new and I m happy with it. 
24637 Nice product, all is well 
24638 Bought for my little cousin. She loves it. Film can get expensive though. 
24639 It did not work at all 
24640 Smaller than I expected. Work great for a variety of projects. 
24641 great transaction. Product as described 
24642 Very hood 
24643 Bright, floaty, and easy to use. 
24644 For the price it is a great little camera. 
24645 Nice 
24646 This was a great price. Want to add more shooting time? This is a must have. This also adds stability when handling the camera. 
24647 Wearing glasses can be a curse, especially when dealing with the eye piece on a camera. The Hoodman has proven extremely useful in easing that issue and now that I have it, I m not sure how I did without it before. 
24648 Camera fits. Not much room for anything else. 
24649 Good 
24650 I really like this camera very much, shoots good pictures! 
24651 Easy to use for my first digital camera. Pictures I have taken are very nice with the effects I wanted. 
24652 It malfunctioned and I m actually trying to return it and get a refund 
24653 Good basic wifi ip camera, The down side, are the installation instructions, i had to use a third party IP Camera viewer to use. Not in English, 
24654 Took very good underwater pictures and videos! 
24655 ok 
24656 great 
24657 Awesome 
24658 Works well just tough if you don t have the proper TV. 
24659 Just have received this and it works just as advertised. Blue tooth connected quickly and my iPhone6 fit just right. 
24660 Have a Canon EOS T5. Fits pefectly. Holds all accessories plus some. 
24661 Made a fire in 15 seconds, first try right out of the box! The magnifying lens works great too! 
24662 This camera is fantastic, quick and small enough to carry all day casually, yet it has plenty of features for when you really want to dial in those amazing shots to remember. Works great for everything I ve thrown at it and has good battery life. 
24663 Bulkier than expected. Difficult to get focused. Researching the YouTube tricks to adjust the internal stuff adjusted 
24664 good 
24665 Excellent system. My husband bought it for a client, and he says it has excellent resolution! Unfortunately he couldn t test the remote viewing feature as the location where it was placed does not have internet option. But other than that, a very good system. 
24666 Works perfectly with my set up. Great deal! 
24667 Best small camera I ve used. And, it has an interchangeable lens!! 
24668 Good camera, be aware of sellers, some send Chinese version and there is no way to change OS 
24669 I bought 2. Nice resolution when working. My unit failed within 8 months. This is not an outdoor camera. 8 months later it failed due to water inside the camera. The one mounted indoor is still working. 
24670 Simple, works well, and nicely priced. 
24671 I purchased as a gift. Please don;t bug me again for a review. 
24672 very confortable and useful 
24673 I wanted a frame for my GoPro and saw this. For the price I thought it was a great deal. I wanted the frame for better sound quality as well. I am pleased with this frame and it holds my GoPro very well. A great product. 
24674 Bought this for my husband--he loves it-stilling learning with it-something new each nite. Very happy with it ! 
24675 Thanks so much all products are in good conditions 
24676 Had lights with pull string and what an improvement this has made, no more trying to find the string in the dark. Walk in and the light turns on and can adjust the time the light stays on with no motion. 
24677 Plastic d ring that the strap attaches to broke after a week when the bag dropped from my shoulder to the crook of my elbow...now I have no strap, and I drop my camera :( 
24678 Very good. Great price and value. Will Recommend. 
24679 Not super ultra precise and perfectly accurate, but they do the job and they are certainly affordable. 
24680 Great little camera for the dough, great video. Batteries do not last very long, however bought some spare. The case cracked at the hinges with very little stress, so I only give it 3 stars. The accessories are great. Not bad for the price. 
24681 Works great. car charger adapter a real plus!! 
24682 Good for any water goer! 
24683 The lenses are very snug and require a bit of force to get into the holder. Otherwise, they are really nice and I love the &#34;wallet&#34; holder. 
24684 INCREDIBLE Camera... best I have ever owned... exceptional in every way... as advertised... arrived on time... NO surprises... THANKS, J 
24685 Works fine! Great price! 
24686 I love it!! It is most definitely the best camera I ve ever owned. It is easy to use and takes great pictures. 
24687 They fit perfectly, work great, and don t take too long to charge. 
24688 Overall great material made. I don t have the original one but happy with this one. WORTH! 
24689 Vast improvement over the other ones I have tries. The eye shield stayed attached the whole day out in the field shooting. 
24690 I m looking for the same bag just a little bigger, it works well made very well. 
24691 Works Great! I highly recommend it if you need so see how the colors will will look in print before you print. 
24692 GIFT FOR MY 12 YEAR OLD. OF COURSE SHE LOVED IT...LOL 
24693 I use this as a kitty cam when I am traveling and it is by far the best investment I ve made. I love being able to check in on my babies when I am away. 
24694 very good 
24695 This is my son s first real camera and he loves it. He has taken some really fantastic shots. 
24696 Works good. A little loose on the swivel but it does the trick. 
24697 For the GP4, the back cover is useless, but everything else works excellently and fits perfectly. Don t even but a GP4 without this kit to protect the housing and lens glass elements - it s just not smart. 
24698 As expected which is nice 
24699 Great product for the money. The kit got me off to a good start and the lens works perfectly. The more I learn the more use I have for each of the items in the kit so it was a wise purchase. 
24700 Excellent! Thank you!! 
24701 Heavy, difficult to open but worst of all. the micro SD cards do not stay in the cut outs and fall out when the case is opened. The foam that should hold the cards is too hard and the cards &#34;wiggle&#34; out 
24702 Came with batteries, worked inside through the walls & outside from a distance. Simple on/off buttons. Great product, highly recommend. 
24703 Charged up quickly, lights stayed on for 6 hours which is what the maker of the lights specified. I m happy. 
24704 Stable as stable gets, but heavy as hell. Seriously it is extremely heavy. 
24705 great battery for go pro last long and has pretty affordable price 
24706 For the price I think it works great!!! 
24707 should be in everyones bag 
24708 This replacement for my camera worked just fine. 
24709 It s ok for the price I paid for. 
24710 Delivery and product were excellent! 
24711 The viewer needs to be on a direct 90 degree/ perpendicular angle to see the true image and color. From an angle the image appears washed out 
24712 Awesome addition to my boyfriends warehouse where he shoots and is constantly moving around!!! 
24713 gets stuck when trying to remove the lens from the body of my camera but does the job otherwise. 
24714 Thanks so much. Fast shipping and great product :) 
24715 Got this without looking closely. It s made from soft low quality plastic... was expecting fabric. Worried it will get brittle over time and crack. The Gels very in quality and thickness. Honestly it feels pretty cheap. 
24716 I love looking at clusters and this eyepiece is awesome. I use Celestron X-Cels and this eyepiece is a great addition for the money. Very good optics for the budget astronomer like me. 
24717 Did not fit our camera. 
24718 Met expectations. 
24719 Love it but the velrco is AGGRESSIVE. Protect your curly headed kids and poodles from it s grasp. 
24720 Fast and easy transaction. Camera set up very simple. Happy with purchase. 
24721 Says wireless but won t connect to it. 
24722 Dangerous design. Cam weight causes it to tangle in lines causing kite to lose control. 
24723 Was useful in looking at some old slides. 
24724 Have to take &#34;innards&#34; of eyepiece out if you want to maintain the original view in the viewfinder - not difficult to do 
24725 Very good optical properties, perfect fit. 
24726 Legs won t stay extended. Ball head works well, but there is really no point to the extendable legs if they can t be locked in place. I will return this product. 
24727 Cant even record in daylight. Need I say more... 
24728 Really great asset if you are attempting to use available light and the light isn t cooperating. re-direct and use for fill or to enhance exisiting light 
24729 good quality 
24730 I like that the cord has an adjustment button. Other camera floats are sort of one size. Works well for it s purpose. 
24731 Little disappointed in the frame the picture it s self is smaller than I realized it would be. Also didn t get the remote, only good thing the company refunded me because of that & let me keep the frame so I guess I did come out ahead. 
24732 The on button is hard to push to get it turned on, video is fine, thank god for its remote. 
24733 It does the job. enough said. 
24734 Good items! 
24735 Good product but too big for my needs. 
24736 Works better than the original battery and the charger is great 
24737 After having my IRIS a month I really needed it. This is a perfect with. You do need to remove the props. But probably a good idea anyway. 
24738 This lease is a macro lens, but it lacks vibration reduction, so clarity suffers for close ups unless you use a tripod. 
24739 Fits the Nikon very well 
24740 We bought this for our wedding for a our photo booth. Works great. Takes nice pictures. I love that you can save the photos to an SD card. Very impressed. Would recommend. 
24741 Excellent...! 
24742 So far, i ve only used it a couple of times, and it s very user friendly. Great product for me! 
24743 Excellent product, I used the filters easily and the results were as expected. I recommend it 100%. 
24744 My son likes this for his camera. 
24745 case#c6725292 Agent AR004611 Excellent Customer Service and very helpfull. Nice product, nice quality and easy to use. 
24746 nice light case 
24747 Works better than I ve expected. 
24748 Amazing Stand. It s very strong. 
24749 Exceeded my expectations, perfect lighting for streaming online. 
24750 Perfect for my camera! 
24751 I have only used them 2 times. And 1 transmitter doesn t work. And 1 receiver the connector piece broke off and my flash fell off into my softbox luckily that caught it. 
24752 Good Bag! 
24753 Worked great thanks. 
24754 Excellent camera, great shots, crisp and beautiful...worth the purchase 
24755 Works well world wide or at least in Europe. 
24756 Excellent, couldn t be more satisfied... 
24757 if you are beginner with filter I would recommend it, because is cheap. it gives cause glare and you see the rim of the plastic holder. 
24758 Good case 
24759 Works fine. A little cumbersome to take on and off, but this is minor. Be careful not to over-tighten. 
24760 Works great. 
24761 It could hold a charge longer but it s good enough. 
24762 Perfectly fits Nex5-R 
24763 This was for my daughter and she really enjoyed it. Shipped right away so I enjoyed that. 
24764 Fits my new Canon 50mm lens. Works great, Price was great. 
24765 I love this lens. The optical capability is phenomenal for the price. I use ti with my K-x. Its great for potraits, and just street photography. Even some scenery. I love Pentax! Thank you!!! 
24766 I love this. Easy to use and light weight 
24767 Its okay. Fun to fly once you get the proper trim because otherwise it has a mind of its own. Also, the camera SUCKS! its worse than stand definition so if i keep it, I absolutely must find a higher def (real HD) camera for this thing. 
24768 Very good 
24769 Great batteries for Fujifilm camera.... They last long... 
24770 The best! 
24771 Did not met my expectations... 
24772 Great and reliable strap 
24773 This is a replica it does not work, I ve downgraded over 300 ps3s amd this clip is giving errors no matter what. Do not buy it s is not authentic 
24774 Fit perfectly on my hd ghost. 
24775 It s a total piece of crap but it works as a minimal travel tripod to throw into a bag and jump on an airplane for a shoot. 
24776 Awesome product. Works great in wet, hot, dry, or cold climates. Would recommend this to anyone that has a Gopro. 
24777 Fit great, last longer than the original! 
24778 DISSAPOINTED!!!! Only after a few shots, the battery went dead. I had it replaced but then I was greeted only with a blank screen. A total waste of time and money !!!! DO NOT PURCHASE !!! I gave this a 1 star only because NO STARS is not an option. 
24779 Great product, great price. Shipping was quick and everything was as described, very high Quality. I bought them for my Anart and they are perfect! I would buy them again and certainly recommend them to anyone looking for a back up or replacement battery. 
24780 Great filter. It is larger than 82mm(the threads to lens are 82mm) on the top half which makes it impossible to use with lens hood. 
24781 Great Tripod--Can collapse or extend to a good lenth. 
24782 great 
24783 Unfortunately it was DOA, display didn t work and it would not program. The process for obtaining a replacement is smooth as silk. I hope that it works so I can rave about it. 
24784 Very good camera. Works great! 
24785 easy to install 
24786 The bag was perfect for my equipment. Plenty of room for my lenses and camera bodies. I even managed to squeeze in a Metz CL-1 flash and various other accessories. The strap for the tripod is a must for bike riders. Good quality bag with plenty of padding. 
24787 Excellent product, fast shipping. Buy without hesitation. 
24788 I couldn t stop reading. Loved the characters. This prompted a lot of discussion with friends. Totally recommend it. 
24789 Best thing ever i got for my flash. It work very good. Makes a difference!!!! Good material, you cant go wrong with this. 
24790 Great product and they perform exactly as expected. Much better than the permanently attached prop guards for ease of use with a carrying case. Comes with all the tools/parts needed to fit a variety of Phantom quadcopters as well. 
24791 Great value. Lens worked perfectly and nice extras 
24792 Great I didn t expect this kind tripod but I love it 
24793 The product description says that this is a &#34;Pre-made 125 foot RG59 and power cable&#34; Received and installed these only to find that is not RG59 as required by my security cameras. Laview says these are RG58 and they will not work. Buyer beware. 
24794 The battery has worked as advertised. 
24795 excelent 
24796 You cannot beat this lens as an end in itself, but if you attempt to stitch a pan at close range, you will discover some interesting distortion realities. Even long range shots will give interestingly distorted cloud formations without attempting any stitching. 
24797 Everything was as promised and the batteries are a life saver when traveling. I love the tripod it works better that trying to take selfies. 
24798 awesome. like this battery it s nice to have a spare 
24799 Decent quality for the price. Works well. Case fit perfectly onto my S4 (T-mobile). 
24800 Fit my A58 perfectly level comes in handy when not using tripod which has 2 levels. 
24801 Fits perfect on the new third generation 50mm STM 1.8 lens. Only difference is the price as this was about 25% the cost of the real Canon Lens hood. Camer neatly boxed with lens cleaning cloth. What a Deal!!!! 
24802 Light and durable 
24803 A must have for any lens! This keep me for loosing my lens cap. It was easy to stick it on the cap, no additional glue need. 
24804 Great price for a double item which solved me not having to find each one by its self. works great for what it was designed for. 
24805 good 
24806 Works well 
24807 Great price and perfect fit. 
24808 We love it! And we are ordering 2 more cameras. Night vision is perfect. 
24809 Wonderful keeps everything together. 
24810 great! 
24811 great products. Thanks 
24812 A good product. 
24813 Love this strap it was more of a blue than a green but still great 
24814 Love it! Takes beautiful pictures and is very easy to use. Small and lightweight. 
24815 I did order 2 of them..one for me and the other one as a gift..for my surprise my friend told me he got an empty box..with no pen inside..and was not able to replace it because it was after one month..and the box was outside US... 
24816 My original charger broke and I was luck to find this charger. It worked every bit as good as the original. I was very pleased in every way. 
24817 Works great with the app. The sound cuts in and out sometimes so it s hard to hear on the camera side. It might be when two people are watching it at the same time though. Pretty good quality to 
24818 This is a great camera. Could make due with a few advanced features, but I love it anyway :) 
24819 great product. helped immensely with my old slides. 
24820 Even brighter than I thought. Great deal. Thanks! 
24821 Not very good, it is loud and obnacious and it isn t very good quality. I DIDN T LIKE IT!! 
24822 Very nice lens. Used at sons baseball game standing at outfield fence 200 to 220 feet away. 
24823 Works GREAT 
24824 Works well 
24825 It s great thanks 
24826 Works great and easy to install. 
24827 Keeping my Nikon cameras powered on all my adventures! 
24828 I haven t got much use for it yet but I can see how it adds extra protection and would make it more visible if I were to ever drop the camera in the water, snow, etc. Good quality product. 
24829 great little camera, comes with all you need to use it. 
24830 Terrible. DO NOT BUY. Most do not even work. Pretty sure most of these reviews are not real. 
24831 The battery was exactly as described and arrived on-time in appropriate packaging. 
24832 Great strap for half the price of the black rabbit. I have used this on numbers of shoot and not have any issue with this strap. Stays in place all day even with a long lens on the camera. Again, can t beat the price. 
24833 The first really thin filter that lives up to expections. Recommended. 
24834 Actually used to give my pinhole USB webcam a wider field of view since clip held lens over it good. It also worked on my cell phone so I plan to get another. 
24835 Great product 
24836 These are too big for a back pocket but if I move lighting equipment I have them with me and they help a lot. 
24837 We ve had this product for 1 week. The charger and batteries work well. Only think that was a bit challenging was I really had to push to get the batteries to fit into the charger the first time. 
24838 Perfectly cute for a party or for photography props! They came with popsicle sticks to stick on to them which is way better than the small sticks that come with other paper photo props! Even came with chalk! 
24839 Battery inserts are a bit fumbly, but so far this device has performed great. As advertised. 
24840 Very good pictures and video quality. Price right for the product, very happy with the purchase. 
24841 So far so good.It took me less than 15minutes to get the camera up and streaming to my IPhone. The picture was crisp and colors were true. 
24842 I wish this was more robust, the top keep coming off when I use it.... 
24843 I have noticed no difference as far as I can tell at this point. I received them a week ago and have used them all this week shooting. Time will tell if they hold up. But the price is right! I have to say that. 
24844 Good batteries. I think they lose charge just a teensy bit faster than I d prefer, but they re good, solid products. 
24845 Perfect airline case for tripods, light stands, chargers, clothes, and umbrellas. Never gotten charged oversized either! 
24846 As advertised. 
24847 network browsing not possable due to ie 8 not supported unless you mak your computer less secure no updates avlaable 
24848 Perfect replacement for our dead mic at a great price. 
24849 This is the second on and still very happy, have purchased more to add to system. Good clarity and color. 
24850 Omg this lens is awesome I love taking nature pictures. I got it today couldn t wait to get it out of the box 
24851 I have used them for a year now & like it! 
24852 Excellent item for the cost 
24853 Works great 
24854 AS expected 
24855 Super versatile! Great product! 
24856 Came in the mail quickly and did not disappoint. 
24857 Fast service, product as described. Would do biz, again. 
24858 was a gift for a family member 
24859 Excellent product. Received the product faster than expected and the video and picture quality are great especially for the price. 
24860 Holds the GoPro just right 
24861 The bag is nice, but the top strap broke a few days after I started using it while on vacation. 
24862 They are what they are but the video quality isn t that great compared to my shorter cords. I thought my camera was going so I swapped it and same thing. 
24863 Very happy with it! Charges my nikon d3100 like a dream. 
24864 After 1 month of use, the anchor loop that the shoulder strap attaches to tore from the bag causing it to drop. Luckily none of my brand new gear was damaged. 5 starts to Amazon for processing my return and refund. 
24865 Can be difficult to use but definitely a great buy for the money. just takes some getting used to 
24866 loved the package deal 
24867 Compact lens and a must have addition for EOS M owners....makes the camera really portable. 
24868 Great set has everthing you need to keep your camera clean 
24869 The top is slightly crooked but maybe that s just me. Other than that it s really good. Especially for $15 
24870 Works as advertised. I installed most of them outdoors under my eaves and more than one year later all work just like new! 
24871 Great! Thank you very much....... 
24872 return 
24873 Quadcopter mount-- a bit heavey for flying--great photos--just under Mobius quality. 
24874 Gift for my granddaughter. She loved it! 
24875 It works well! 
24876 Neat idea, but this camera kept shutting itself off. That makes it useless. I contacted Polaroid, and they said that the problem was with the brand of SD card. That may be, but the camera should work with any card, especially a top name brand. 
24877 Liking this camera.... For the price I am impressed... 
24878 Getting shadow from this so still on the fence. maybe ill actually learn how to use it some day. lol 
24879 The picture quality is excellent, even with the night vision, FTP on wireless works very well too, love the camera and would like to recommend this to anyone. 
24880 Absolutely fell in love with the 6D the moment I had it in my hands. Just what I needed to enter into full frame. A great upgrade from the Canon Rebel Series. 
24881 Given as gift, recipient loved it. 
24882 Its a nice little lens, great under dark light but does not extend as far as I want that is why my 18-50 is probably what I will stick with. 
24883 I like it 
24884 It was the wrong charger. 
24885 NICE CAMERA WITH VERY CLEAR PICTURE. INSTALLED EASILY. GOOD LENSE FOR GENERAL &#34;AROUND THE HOUSE&#34; PLACEMENT. 
24886 Works great. 
24887 This kit has everything I need to have many options when using my go pro Hero 3 Silver 
24888 This set brought everything I need to introduce my students to electronics. 
24889 A birthday gift for my husband. He really enjoys the camera. Shipping was on time and in good shape. It was a very successful purchase. 
24890 Poor quality product, was broken when received. 
24891 Great product, it worked great! I recommend it highly! 
24892 It would be nice if the instructions made any sense. 
24893 Sensitive as it should be 
24894 Works great with my canon video camera 
24895 The bag was not the same as in the picture nor the ones previous buyers had. Besides that and the bag being a bit snug for my Canon, it is a good case. 
24896 Works great and shipped in a timely fashion! 
24897 We love the bag it is able to carry all the things for our camera. Shipping was awesome. 
24898 excellent 
24899 Much more durable than other third party eye cups! 
24900 Very efficient and they charge fast. Definitely a great comparison to the name brand of Canon. 
24901 I got to use it ONCE and it completely stopped working. Needless to say, I m a bit pissed about that. 
24902 The strap is neoprene. I have no confidence in it not wearing and breaking suddenly. I replaced it. 
24903 Cameras are useless without extra light at night. 
24904 Great little tripod. Even supports the weight of my Canon T5i with a large macro lens attached. Very handy for those quick shots that don t work well hand-held. 
24905 Battery came in fast and it works great. Ordered another one and that one works great. Would recommend the seller and the batteries. 
24906 Works well with the most Acra-Swiss mounts... nice compact design doesn t block battery door on most of my cameras. 
24907 This is an amazing camera bag. Its thick and durable. It has lots of compartments for your camera and lens. Great space for extra batteries and accessories. My fiancé loves it. well worth the extra few dollars. 
24908 Fits my camera perfectly. Very compact and high quality. I love the gray color! 
24909 Nice set 
24910 Can t get it to work. Long hours on the phone with D-link. It functions, but not as Dliink advertises. 
24911 Great replacement 
24912 Great lens! Takes nice sharp photos. It s a heavier lens so it takes some time to get used to. Using a tripod or upping the shutter speed will eliminate any camera shake. I use this lens more than I thought I would. Very happy with this purchase. 
24913 Worked awesome great extinsion for my rgbw led light strip. It s supposed to be for cameras but this power extinsion works like a charm for what I needed for great purchase 
24914 My old cord was giving me trouble this one seems real nice no trouble 
24915 Everything I wanted and more! Very good deal for the price. 
24916 I ve played with it a bit and I honestly can t say i notice a difference between my internal and external on my Mark II. I heard the Rode Video Mic Pro is the way to go if you want an honest good sound. 
24917 Did not work, gave my money away :( 
24918 Excellet 
24919 Great deal on this system. Very easy to set up and use. Very easy to set up the mobile app on iPhones. Just download the app and scan the QR code.... It instantly connects! Very helpful support forum on the Amcrest website. 
24920 Works perfect 
24921 A gift for my wife and she loves it. 
24922 ar004214 Great customer service, they walked me thru the set up and got everything working like it should. 
24923 Sick!!! 
24924 So happy with my new hard to find battery for my Nikon Cool Pix Camera! 
24925 If you have a gopro you need spare batteries. I ve used Wasabi for a hero3 and now for my hero4. I don t really notice any amazingly longer runtime, but they work and are dependable. Best part is the charger that comes with, very convenient 
24926 For the price they are fine, but they don t really fit exactly. If you are easy on them the work fairly ok 
24927 Super well made item. Great price! 
24928 just okay some lenses are usless 
24929 work great 
24930 Just as expected 
24931 Perfect! 
24932 Great Product will buy again. 
24933 All work perfectly with my new go pro hero 4. Every bit of kit feels nice and solid and well made. This would certainly meet the needs of most thrill seekers. 
24934 The bag holds my camera equipment but just did not expected to be so big 
24935 Good price fast delivery 
24936 Great piece of equipment, well built and filters as it should. 
24937 Nice product! Great for hiking. Just attach to bag while you hike and charge your batteries. I would recommend it to anyone. 
24938 NEEDED SUPPLIES 
24939 Got this camera for my son who is studying photojournalism. He loves this camera. 
24940 Seems way less than 52. 
24941 I am always pleased with the Sigma filters. 
24942 Worked as expected, easy to install. 
24943 Perfect! Hold flash, diffusion dome, spare batteries and has a belt loop. Nice, solid, sturdy durable fabric. Expect to use it for years to come 
24944 bgs. 
24945 very convenient in certain situations. 
24946 I purchased two of these and bought a third one today! Great product. 
24947 Good product, delivery on times, I like it ! 
24948 broke after 3 months and i can t find a warranty 
24949 This was my first reflector purchase and it looks just like the picture. I don t think the material is flimsy, but I am not hard on equipment either. 
24950 This is a very nice storage case. I would repurchase again. 
24951 Came rapidly and on-time. Exactly as advertised. I am impressed with the instruction material that came with it. There is little else that you might want to head out prospecting. 
24952 Perfect as shown, thank you. 
24953 tks 
24954 A+ great doing business with you. Great product. 
24955 worked great on raining days in canada 
24956 Advertised as wireless, but only works when hard wired to the other speaker....useless. I returned it. 
24957 as expected 
24958 Not very good quality batteries. Don t hold near as good a charge as name brand batteries. 
24959 For the a7rII. Fits perfectly. No compatibility errors with the battery. Both battery icons appear on top right corner. Looks and feels like the camera body and grip. All custom buttons, wheel, and AF/MF buttons function correctly. Meike Battery Pack. $340 cheaper than original. 
24960 Service was great, arrived on time but after a day of use it broke, it could ve been that I was over using it but my advice is just be careful with it 
24961 These little pieces make a big difference, great experience from seller! 
24962 Great product and good price 
24963 i can t get the thing to record. some how when i got it to work it won t play on my computer. i find it junk. 
24964 Thank you 
24965 Easy to install. Easy to use. Great pics! Will buy another. 
24966 It works so well, I love this. 
24967 I LOVE this lens! Not great in low light without a tripod because there s no stabilizer for shake but if you re outside, it s great for the price! 
24968 Great stand sets up quickly, and supports large modifiers well. If weight is a consideration, this beast is heavy. 
24969 Great price and fast shipping. Works fine with my Nikon D3200. 
24970 Great for party use you don t have to be a professional to use. Takes excellent pics with little effort. 
24971 Very NICE 
24972 This film is beautiful and I could not be happier with it! 
24973 Loves that it doesn t twist once the gopro is attached 
24974 A++++++++ 
24975 Good 
24976 probably just wasted money on this. 
24977 Had to tighten spring clip to hold wire in! 
24978 Very easy to use and clear. 
24979 Perfect was what i need 
24980 Love the camera works great outdoors. Love the WFI to send pictures to my tablet or computer. 
24981 Works great but sometimes freezes and has to be restarted - great value for money! 
24982 works great ,fast shipping 
24983 Didn t even work... WTF 
24984 Not as useful as I thought it was going to be. 
24985 It s good to have these for Cloud functionality. However, I thought this can be used as a NAS. It s basically a personal cloud storage if you re trying to find one. 
24986 Good battery at a good price 
24987 Holds up just like the one that came with my D5300! 
24988 turn nob past first click to switch on, but the light only comes on when turn 1/3 of the way on. so the range is only 2/3. 
24989 Got for my Canon Rebel T3i. Works great!! Great price as well! 
24990 Even when moving the lens around to optimal placing over the camera, the photo quality is terrible. 
24991 I bought a 7mm one and find myself using my 32mm omni much more, go figure. Eye relief is better than regular omni plossl eps at the shorter focal lengths.but it is quite large and heavy, be ready to rescue and rebalance your rig if needed. 
24992 Perfect, exactly as described. 
24993 Good. Does the job 
24994 POS, will not even show up when plugged into computer. Garbage 
24995 Super incroyable 
24996 Nice one I use it for birding to get easier focus in which part in suspect i want 
24997 Gives me the extra battery life I need when using my GoPro while traveling. I also love all the adapters and the car charger. I travel internationally frequently and this gives me the ability to take my GoPro anywhere. Thanks, Wasabi! 
24998 Works great and Good price 
24999 Mine worked fine for two years and then out of the blue they both quit. Will not reset or connect to wifi anymore. Philips tech support couldn t do a thing. 
25000 Excellent quality and super fast shipping! 
25001 one of teh best thing i ever got!! 
25002 Very Good 
25003 It se a grate camera!! 
25004 The lens lid barely fits with the filter on, so I have to be really careful not to lose the lid. 
25005 Great replacement and very affordable 
25006 Love the camera! 
25007 Like the frame picture display and thickness (so thin). Still work OK except once a while it shutdown by itself and I cannot turn it on except unplug and plug in again. Like the motion sensor and USB flash drive support. 
25008 This is not made of leather! 
25009 Good product for the $$ 
25010 as advertised 
25011 convenient product for system setup 
25012 Love this purchase! heavy duty tripod, is perfect 
25013 The housing feels weak and I have to constantly adjust specially on roller coasters. 
25014 These batteries seem to last about 2/3 s of the time the original camera battery does. 
25015 good stuff saves lots of time 
25016 Very Nice piece of equipment. Although refurbished it works as new. 
25017 very nice telescope but if you are not gonna leave it put together somewhere, setting up can be a pain. 
25018 Nice camera. Did need some Tech Support to get my remote set up. Vincent at Foscam Tech Support is AWESOME! He definitely knows what he is doing! 
25019 Good range, good picture. For the price the was a pretty good setup 
25020 It s a good protector for the lens, I use the camara for motocycle ride ando for car racing, so it is indispensable to protect your lens.it s crystal clear. 
25021 This is amazing I love the one of the best purchases I have made in a while! 
25022 Just as shown 
25023 Camera was very easy to set up. The image is clear. Features operate great. I now have 5 of there. The only drawback is that my computer slows down to a crawl when I have all 5 cameras up and running. Otherwise they nice and give me peace of mind. 
25024 This one is OK 
25025 As advertised. 
25026 Love this case. I bought it to carry my Panasonic Lumix FZ200. It fits perfectly, and I love the side compartment s. They fit an extra battery and memory card. 
25027 It s awesome. 
25028 Great quality quick shipping! 
25029 It s not so steady. Head strap and chest belt both. 
25030 Received it and works so far 
25031 Awesome. I use with BlueIris via wireless connection and get perfect video with no packet loss. (4000K, CBR, 20fps, 2048x1536, audio) Lot s of features for the money. These can hidden fairly easily into various nick-nacks around the home. 
25032 good 
25033 arrived before shipping estimate. good product 
25034 Nice lens! 
25035 Great 
25036 exactly what I needed. 
25037 I love this camera so much. I was a little worried when I ordered it cause there isn t any reviews but im glade I did cause its an amazing camera! you can take action pictures and they turn out great I love it! 
25038 Camera do not match photo. IR leds are not black like they are in photo. they are white. quality was bad. cheap joints and felt very poorly made. 
25039 I ve only used several of the accessories but they seem to perform reasonably well. 
25040 Got this thing for my hero3+ and was not disappointed. I really love the locking feature and the color makes it pop. Pretty sturdy for a gopole. Price is reasonable too 
25041 Product arrived promptly and exactly as described. 
25042 Works great 
25043 The batteries last as long as the original battery. I have found that having 3 batteries is plenty for most recordings. This gives you 3 hours of recording time with the Go Pro Hero Silver. 
25044 The stick itself is ok, but after a few uses during diving, appropriately cleaning it of saltwater and letting it dry, it s so rusted at the pole extension points and the screw that it leaves rust all over my hands, and is almost impossible to extend out now. 
25045 They work great with the Canon EOS Rebel camera 
25046 best idea ever 
25047 Not good, lens didn t focus well, most times it will go back and forth without focusing. When it did focus the pictures where ok, not great. The motor is slow and left me not impressed. 
25048 Purchased as a gift for a talented young photographer. No complaints from recipient. Request for IS lens important to him for taking video captures with unit. Canon or Nikon. Lexus or Infinity. Same argument. I have been a Canon user since 1972. 
25049 WORKED GOOD FOR 2 WEEKS 
25050 GREAT PRICE, GOT IT FAST! 
25051 Worked as advertised. Saved $. 
25052 Pros: Roomy, room to fit mroe than 1 tripod. Cons: Zipper broke after a year. Rating of 1 star because with a broken zipper its basically useless Would NOT recommend based on my experience.. 
25053 poorly made, first 2 broke when putting on lens 
25054 Fast Shipping but Zmodo is bad quality :( 
25055 Good in low light conditions. Nikon still needs to improve the lense covers. 
25056 Wonderful!Great quality! 
25057 THE best camera for vlogging. The wide angle (although fisheye) is very good quality and has many options when it comes to filming. The best part about this though is the AUDIO. Perfect sound 100% of the time, it is crazy how well the microphones work. 
25058 very nice way to view your photos.but the adaptor needs to be replace.it will stop the photo slide,the clock will also stop running.,the frame is very nice with a nice matting. 
25059 The RX 100 CAMERA is excellent. Some of the items that would come with the camera were missing (tripod), I have received 3 batteries instead of one, and a kit for cleaning the lenses that was not listed in the package I have bought. 
25060 good 
25061 great for photography back up. 
25062 This didn t work for me. The corners of the photo was shaded. Destroyed use of pictures. Be forewarned. 
25063 Glare... useless! 
25064 The battery can be overcharged? If you charge longer than 1 hour at 15 minutes, it seems to burn up the battery. 
25065 great gift! 
25066 I really like the timer and the resolution was so good, I ordered an extra pair. 
25067 a bit thin .. 
25068 great 
25069 First time out of the box...lines through the screen. SO disappointed with this product. 
25070 does the intended job, however would have been better if came with the actual bolt/screw so not having to swap out everything when needing to swap out 
25071 Flimsy. Can t hold my camera. 
25072 No problems 
25073 fits my camaer and woks as expected 
25074 A gift- but much appreciated. 
25075 Does what it s supposed to go, however if you take your Micro SD card and plug it straight to your laptop it makes transferring photos a lot quicker than just plugin the camera to your PC via usb. 
25076 i received with good condition and I m surprised because I find extra flash with it .....thank you 
25077 for a bearing slider at this price you can t complain. holds well, little bit of a drag on heavier cameras but overall great buy! 
25078 Works well, easy to install, kept track of home and horses while on vacation. Great to have peace of mind while not at home!! 
25079 Readout of battery levels different from camera screen indication. 2nd battery stop charging and become unrecognised after a while. 
25080 This is about the 4th or 5th one I have purchased. I love the price and it s the only camera I can find with an actual view finder for those sunny days when you can t see diddly on the screen. 
25081 Camera looked NIB but would not power on. I have ordered this twice and had the same problem with both. The first one worked for 10 minutes and then never again. Not the camera for me. 
25082 Its has little pouches on the inside for extra SD cards or at least 50$ in singles with out bothering the camera or making it difficult to close 
25083 Good product!!! It is working good, I m going to continue using it for a few weeks, so I ll can do an interensting review 
25084 These worked great 
25085 Great camera. Lots of features. One thing to remember: You only use the provided hardwired Ethernet cable to hook to your modem in order to setup the camera and then you disconnect it for wireless capability. Can be placed anywhere. Needs electrical outlet. Works great with android Samsung S5. 
25086 Nice tight fit. 
25087 Wish you could take off the strap. Otherwise works great. 
25088 Exactly a replacement for my old one. Delivered in 4 days, Excellent 5 Star 
25089 Easy to install, an happy with this purchase 
25090 I DO NOT KNOW WHO TO USE THAT ITEM meca1456@netzero.com THANK 
25091 Bought this to full my 8 ch Sannce DVR and work great 
25092 great product 
25093 AAA 
25094 Works well 
25095 This product is pure garbage. Would not work for me on android app or windows desktop app. Instructions are in broken English and the windows desktop app set off Korean language warnings from my firewall. I recommend not purchasing this. 
25096 Junk item! Didn t work, had to get Amazon involved before anything was done about it 
25097 Used them several times on the standard camera tripod mounting screw. Works well and I expect they will last a lifetime. 
25098 Very useful. 
25099 Works great, with the A6000 
25100 This is great! I found a YouTube video to show me how to set it up because it doesn t come with clear instructions, but it s a great product. 
25101 good value 
25102 Would have preferred a slightly larger interior. only holds one lens. But does hold all other gear - extra memory cards and batteries. 
25103 Great quality, mounts on tripod with tripod adaptor for ease of viewing distant objects or the stars and planets. 
25104 So far only 2 of the batteries hold a charge. Will update later. 
25105 worked great 
25106 Holds up well , good usage 
25107 Fits the camera well. Not much room for extras. Maybe an extra battery and memory card. Should pack well and protect camera. 
25108 Not a L series that s for sure... 
25109 Really great little mount for 3m roku projector. Durable and flexible, I only wish it were slightly longer legged. 
25110 I bought this remote for my GoPro Hero4 and it works great! Lost connectivity under water if you are more than a foot or so away from the camera but otherwise it was awesome! 
25111 Item start up the first time and would not start since. Have to return for repair/replacement. For the price, it should have this kind of of problems. Does not recommend until problem is solved. 
25112 The only problem I ve had is you can t get everything back in the case. Everything else has been great. 
25113 great tripod!! I highly recommend it!! 
25114 Both tripods broke, remote does not work, HDMI cord would not work, camera bag is big enough for the camera itself (no lens included) and batteries each lasted a good 45 minutes. 
25115 good 
25116 Awesome Attachment to my DSLR 
25117 This item is exactly what I wanted. 
25118 Took them to Yellowstone and loved them. Looking forward to using them this fall in the woods. 
25119 Everything you need is in this pack 
25120 Im ok with perfomance not as clear as I would exspect but they do work good. 
25121 This item was just what I was looking for. 
25122 Construction is a bit flimsy but for the price...WELL WORTH IT! 
25123 superb product. as described and perfect fit. 
25124 installed without a hitch. video segments for each system part is clear. appears to be a great system for the price. 
25125 As expected and loving it! Due to the padding you may run out of room if your using it as a camera/laptop bag. 
25126 works great 
25127 This is GREAT! Great Battery and I LOVE it has 12v USA Household Plug and has a Car Charger Built-In Option too! High Quality! 
25128 Fantastic! I love that this is mechanical and I don t have to worry about yet another battery running out. 
25129 good, 
25130 Everything I wanted. Great product for the price. 
25131 Worked as well as original Canon battery. Holds charge for a shorter time, but was expected and was long enough to not cause any problem. Worth the price. 
25132 More faded looking in person Top picture was taken without flash on an overcast day Book was taken with flash inside. Also was my first picture taken. Would like to know if I m doing anything wrong A real waste of money. was not happy with this product 
25133 Really well made and charges my batteries very fast. Had to have a second charger for the road when taking a lot of pictures and need batteries fully charged over a short time. 
25134 No complaints. 
25135 Kenneth at Foscam was very helpful in setting up my camera. He set it up via remote access in just a few minutes. very pleased with their support. 
25136 Perfect replacements for the battery that came with my camcorder. Could not ask for better. 
25137 So good 
25138 It was perfect, I did 3 weeks in Europe and I loved this bag every minute I used it. It held everything I could carry from passports to wallet to cameras and there was plenty of space for extra things. 
25139 They seem to work fine. They come in a nice box. Great Buy 
25140 Wonderful flash for the money. Serves my purposes perfectly. 
25141 Excellent but you may need a fitting/bushing so check the specs 
25142 LOVE this lnes! Amazing effects, wonderful quality & clarity, such a great range and extremely affordable compared to the Nikon 300MM 
25143 Love the strap. Comfortable and much longer than one that comes with the camera. 
25144 Works great with my copper river cleaning swabs! 
25145 ordered it august 10th and received it 3 days later. the shipping was obviously very fast. i love this camera so so much. i bought the used one and it is in amazing. the camera looks like its new. i just love this camera! 
25146 Nice package, needed battery for a camera. Ordered it since cheaper than batteries alone, happily surprised to find a charger that runs on 110v and 12v 
25147 Even freebie minitripod and kens cleaning kit. All very practical and welcome. Batteries work as well as factory batteries. 
25148 Works great! 
25149 Received the filter as described and promptly. Fits perfectly and is good quality. 
25150 Delivered on time. Perfect fit for camera and lens. 
25151 It s sturdy, good quality and how it floats in both fresh and salt water makes all the difference. 
25152 Great light for the price! Super bright! 
25153 small, can not fit 2 full frame camera with L lens 
25154 Got these as spares. Can t be happier! 
25155 Works well, great price. I m pleased. 
25156 I like it very much. 
25157 Can t beat it for the price. It works and setup is quick and easy. 
25158 Works good! 
25159 delivered as promised. great condition 
25160 This strap helps carrying the weight of my camera. Having it hang as a cross body is much more comfortable. Great idea!! 
25161 This camera is for my granddaughter & she loves it. It arrived promptly & it is just as advertised. The picture quality is great under water &. Well worth the price. 
25162 Hate it...threw it in the trash, actually. It kept falling off and I was gonna lose it anyways. Save your bucks for one made by Cannon. 
25163 Works like a charm!!!! 
25164 Met my expectations fro protection of the camera body. The flash rail protection flap doesn t seem to stay on but other than that it fit well. 
25165 didn t fit my camera! 
25166 Great fit 
25167 For working on a studio, it make sense to have it connected. However, when working on portraits, it would turn cumbersome. I would recommend it for product photo. 
25168 I ordered a T-ring to Micro 4/3 adapter. One side is T-ring, but the other side is NOT Micro 4/3. It s for some other lens mount but it isn t labeled so I don t know what mount it actually is for. Definitely not Micro 4/3 though. 
25169 Very good 
25170 This lens cap was attached by a stick on button which can easily be dislodged. 
25171 The case is nice but it arrived smelling terrible, like it had been in a damp basement for many years. I was able to watch some of the smell out but I will probably just throw it out at this point. 
25172 Not nothing like you say it was. 
25173 The case is not a convenient way to store the GoPro and all its accessories. It is not versatile enough to allow everything to fit in an easily accessible fashion. 
25174 Good item 
25175 This product is perfectly suitable for a GoPro HERO 3+ Silver Edition which I own. It fits all of my accessories which include: a selfie stick, chest mount, head mount, charging cable, teather, surfing mounts, and other small accessories. 
25176 Great, no lag, you can see what you are capturing. 
25177 Took it with me on vacation and it was very easy to handle ....light weight....and kept my camera in good condition 
25178 Works well as aa standby battery.. 
25179 Have not figured out all the buttons yet but seems to be working well. My photos are very nice. 
25180 The picture is crystal clear and couldn t have asked for more. Great quality. 
25181 This is cool little camera 
25182 Great system for the price. I wish the zoom function was better. The over all picture is not the greatest but it will do. 
25183 Works once in a while 
25184 One of the camera is out of service 
25185 It wasn t as easy to set up as I thought. But, seems to take good pictures in the Easy Mode. 
25186 too complicated, it is a 2 piece lens hood 
25187 I was so excited that this was the exact cable I needed to download my pictures. It came quickly and was very reasonable. 
25188 Cameras work great. Would have been 5 stars but one of the power cords was defective. Had to contact company through Amazon. They did mail a new power cord so now all three cameras operational. Been using for about three weeks, no problems, very pleased with picture quality. 
25189 I got one of these ! It s only lasted one year before the DVR stopped working 
25190 So I m going to return it and see if they will replace it ! I will change my review if they replace it! 
25191 No charger and no battery came with the item I order. 
25192 Not happy that I got it and it s broken - seriously needed it for holiday and I m leaving the next day !!!! 
25193 Makes the grip on the X100s far more secure and comfortable. I feel like I am using a Leica again! Stays permanently mounted on my camera as I don t use an external flash or other things in the hotshoe. For me it is a must-have for this style camera. 
25194 Ok not very practical 
25195 Not a good product. I sent it back 
25196 Very well price for the unit. Thanks. 
25197 Great set at good price 
25198 Somewhat difficult to access software, and difficult to find setting to NOT automatically &#34;share&#34; your pictures with all online applications upon download. Still have not figured out how to find the auto-focus setting. 
25199 This is a great camera for the price. Almost endless possibilities. 
25200 Just like the Orig. canon cap 
25201 Works great. 
25202 This is my go-to strap! The clip that came with it ended up breaking but I purchased a swivel to attach to my body and it works great. Have used this one for years. Highly recommend. 
25203 This hard case is well protected my Instax printer. Like it. 
25204 So far so good after a couple charges 
25205 Thoroughly pleased with the binoculars. Equally happy that I got them at a great price! 
25206 Very good item. 
25207 Fits our new little camera perfectly! My husband carries it on his belt. Very convenient! 
25208 Must have! Great addition and easy to install. 
25209 Battery works great with my Lumix G6. Similar performance to original branded battery. Fast charging also. Great Product so far. 
25210 Very good product. Had to wait a couple weeks and they came from So. Ca. I m just upstate. 
25211 captures motion only occasionally. 
25212 Adorable well packed great books included to give advice can t wait to use it 
25213 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jha2Vzh7oU Have a look see These pages are so inspirational they have motivated me to write so many new songs and create many new videos which I post on Youtube I m only sorry you don t have a larger selection. 
25214 It is what it is 
25215 works ok but too much surface area for wearing on top of motorcycle helmet. It pushes the head back at anything over 65 mph. 
25216 Old school - solid made, great price. Worked on my Novation kit perfectly. 
25217 Its almost two weeks and I still do not have it working..directions are terrible 
25218 It works, so I can keep using my old nikon. 
25219 Very well designed and durable construction. 
25220 Easy to use wth lossless image quality. Trying to adjust features is difficult so I d recommend shooting in AV or Shutter priority. I d recommend for those that are looking to shoot underwater without breaking the bank. 
25221 The digital photos look great. Initially I had a remote control that did not work. I notified Aluratek and they sent a replacement remote control right away and now it works great. Not a bad photo frame for the money. Looking forward to adding more recent vacation photos. 
25222 WORKS LIKE A CHARM. When on vacation, I keep an extra battery in my bag and has come in handy. 
25223 Great thanks 
25224 Exactly what was needed - thank you 
25225 Fits perfectly at a reasonable price, recommended. 
25226 great replacement 
25227 Works as advertised. May not be quite the quality of the real thing, but for the $$$ it works good. 
25228 Haven t used yet, but looking forward to it. Makes setup a lot easier. 
25229 I would give 5 stars if it had blue tooth. Very nice camera for the price. 
25230 Works well. No problems. 
25231 I needed this for a baby monitor. It seems to stay put on the crib well and is easy to use. My only complaint is the top part with the screw moves around, making it hard to stay in place. It works fine overall for my use. 
25232 fits exactly on my canon s110 makes a good job 
25233 I Like it. 
25234 Works greeat 
25235 They are all great. 
25236 I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! SEND ME MORE HOLY CRAP IT WORKS GREAT! I STARTED MAKING VLOGS AND THIS CAMERA WORKS GREAT FOR IT 
25237 It is exactly as described. I would deal with this supplier again 
25238 i just received this is in the mail, so far testing it and playing with the camera it looks to be in good condition. it looks nice and neat. i haven t tested with film yet. when i do, I ll edit this review. 
25239 great quality! 
25240 I got my camera super fast. It s in awesome shape and does take nice pics. I haven t really used it very much yet. I just ordered an sd card so I ll be using it more and I m sure will have great things to say. 
25241 We love the picture. The only thing which is different from what I read from the reviews was that the flash needs be manually instead of manually activated. 
25242 My camera arrived without a sad card. Your product information did not specify that I had to supply one. Stephen K. 
25243 I have been purchasing Lexerd screen protectors for my various cameras over the years and did so again recently for my new Canon PowerShot G16. Once again, the screen protector applied easily and served me well. I highly recommend Lexerd. 
25244 exactly what i needed. very happy with the purchase. thank you! 
25245 Very nice LED variable intensity light for tabletop, video and many other uses-runs very cool. If brand name would cost much more. 
25246 Ordered this for a birthday gift and it was perfect!!! Fun to be able to take pictures and share them too!!! My granddaughter loved it!!!! 
25247 Works great with the Manfrotto MK055XPRO3-3W! 
25248 Well built. 
25249 Awesome! however It would be better if I could host the images on my own website rather than having to share through facebook that then links to Ricoh website. 
25250 Very expensive, the material is fragil and one leg was stuck. I really expected more for this price. 
25251 Simple, but roomy and usable, especially for the price. 
25252 Had trouble with Motion Detection setup. Quick call and with remote connect, Walter had me going in no time..GREAT product and support.! 
25253 Don t trust this on the outside of a moving vehicle. I had it set up on the inside of my windshield and the suction cup falls off even during normal driving conditions. 
25254 Great deal. I ll never run out of batteries. 
25255 wish I had researched a little more and got the next level up. no user friendly when it comes to moving videos to computer. 
25256 It gives you a web site that throws you off you CAN NOT connect. The instructions a joke. you pull the company up on the web everything is in Chinese, I will never order from ELEC again. 
25257 Works awesome, charges fast and the best part is I can charge my batteries in the truck and in my camper when we area camping. Love it! 
25258 Used tis to mount my KK2 board on. Works great for ante-vibe 
25259 Tripod I received is not the one pictured 
25260 Nice little point and shoot. Some buttons on the small side but once you find them it takes great pics! 
25261 Was broken when i got it. Cannot control setting. Wheel was missing 
25262 wrong size 
25263 Great product. Worked exactly as described. The video is very good, also tech support is very good and helpful. Picture quality is great even at night. I can view the live screen on my iPhone/iPad with 4G network when I m away from home where no WiFi is available. 
25264 The PZ0420M camera is lighter and smaller than the more prevelant 32mm board cameras. Quality is excellent and RunCam/SecurityCamera2000 supports it well. Camera is very durable used on a 250 racing quad that crashes frequently. 
25265 I LOVE IT 
25266 Item does not work at all. Came with no directions. Complete junk 
25267 Item came as promised and contains a number of useful items. I would buy from seller again. 
25268 Camera will not work for more than 24 hours without needing a power cycle 
25269 Love it!!, really big props!! 
25270 Perfect for my needs as a wedding cinematographer, it s a shame Sigma company don t make them anymore for Nikon. I was very lucky to find it here on Amazon. 
25271 I love this product very easy to use. I reached out to tech support and spoke to Walter who was very helpful setting up the camera 
25272 Great product! Light weight and durable. Love the water proof carrying bag! 
25273 Works great with real Gopro however it is advertised to fit the DBPOWER camera and the batteries are not the same. No sweat off of my back as I returned that piece of junk and got the real thing! 
25274 Favorite camera 
25275 Could not program the alarm had no instructions to program it 
25276 This lens is a beast. Plus it came two days before expected. 
25277 It performs as advertised and as expected. 
25278 WHY DID I WASTE MY TIME, YOU CAN SEE BETTER WITH THE MOON LIGHT ALONE ! 
25279 Great lens. 
25280 great value and excellent product 
25281 Love it. 
25282 Seems to be overpriced for what you get, but it works quite well. However, it will not remove some stubborn dust particles. Also, you may need to use it a number of times before the sensor is clear of dust. 
25283 Great add to my lighting setup 
25284 Great buy for the money. 
25285 These are excellent devices. I mounted my cameras and now I feel quite secure because I can see 180 degrees around the place. 
25286 exactly what i needed 
25287 not 2000w and terrible to put together and put away. 
25288 Small for sony alpha a6000 + lens 
25289 PERFECT, just what the parents wanted….bought for a baby shower 
25290 This does not work. It was an unfortunate buy, and I was too lazy to return it. Bye-bye money. 
25291 great price. Primary batter ran low at the OC Fair.... could have been a nightmare but having two addition battery let me enjoy the cutting. 
25292 Worked well should ve gone bigger 
25293 LOVE LOVE LOVE they work great!!!!!!!!!!! 
25294 After ordering it I found my original charger and the new one is of the same quality if not better! I now have a spare! ( always good to have on hand...) 
25295 Didn t work the minute it was plugged in... crap product. 
25296 works great i will be getting more for my other cases 
25297 haven t use it yet but yes, its a good buy 
25298 It works well, the image quality is good, and the night vision is super.I love this camera. 
25299 Worked intermittingly. 
25300 It is a nice carry case but I have no use for it now. 
25301 Excelente. 
25302 Shoots very great images, no problem thus far. 
25303 Perfect size to fit spare batteries, charger, cables and a few small accessories for a quick on the go shoot. Good quality, will buy more of these products when needed. Highly recommended for the great price. 
25304 It never worked. 
25305 Poor quality pictures most were blurry and didn t come anywhere close to the beautiful ocean life colors 
25306 Item works perfect, but Amazons idea of Guaranteed delivery dates really leaves a bad taste in your mouth. 
25307 Works well with Canon Camera. 
25308 batteries to large for camera kept popping out couldn t close case 
25309 Used the batteries and charger on recent cruise and everything functioned very well! Delivery was fast as advertised, thanks. 
25310 awesome camera!! my kids love it :) they really love getting the picture immediately and so do I. the picture quality is great for an instant camera! 
25311 very good.... but the shipping is very slow...... 
25312 I liked the product, and had no trouble with the purchase. thank YoU! 
25313 It came folded not rolled could not get creases out very nice quality other than that. 
25314 holds my cannon and the charger. great! 
25315 Just perfect replacemment. 
25316 Highly visible and cares weight of camera. 
25317 Useful. Produces a low hiss. Watch out for the battery, if it becomes low, the mic will make these small pops during your recording. You have to change out your battery if this is the case. Low battery indicator won t help because it doesn t meet the threshold. 
25318 Product worked for about two months and then refused to work even after new batteries were installed. I m not sure if its the receiver or the transmitter. Never the less nothing works after a very short period of time. 
25319 Sturdy way to hold my flash!! 
25320 very pleased with the batteries. shipped on time. 
25321 Great fit... 
25322 Great price for what it can do. Works great as a back up to original charger. But it does get a bit hot. The added bonous is the ability to charge my battery in the car. I do not know how I lived without this feature before. 
25323 This is a good bag. I m using it for a Nikon camera. Everything fits in perfectly. 
25324 excelent 
25325 good quality 
25326 I love it... 
25327 Great product and great delivery. 
25328 Works just fine! 
25329 Works great with the battery from our camera. Delivered on time 
25330 Very satisfied with this tripod for the price. Quality is good, I m not sure if the bubble levels are accurate. Easy loading mount, ball head moves well - doesn t seem too cheap. Definitely recommended. 
25331 Great value, very pleased 
25332 very good 
25333 needs an adaptor 
25334 I have a canon t3i which I use with a 150-600mm lens. Was looking for a tripod that would handle the weight of the combination of camera and lens. This tripod can handle the weight. Very happy with it. 
25335 great seller - delivered as promised! 
25336 These batteries last forever! I like these better than Sonys rip off batteries at $80 a piece, seriously what were they thinking. 
25337 Works well so far, plastic camera mount could be a little more robust, but the quality does match the price-point. With careful intermittent use it shouldn t be a problem. You get what you pay for with this one. 
25338 Nice 
25339 s***!!!!! doesnt slide smooth. 
25340 the best ever! 
25341 Can t beat this price. Recharges the Wasabi and the GoPro branded batteries with no issues so I always have two available. 
25342 fit perfect on my canon EOS 70D! 
25343 Good price for peace of mind. Glad I haven t had to use it. 
25344 In combination with a recently purchased pistol grip tripod, it has provided excellent viewing / stargazing. 
25345 Very happy with the camera. Only problem I have is that it did not come with the memory chip. Other than that I was very satisfied with the purchase. 
25346 a little overprized but still love it! 
25347 Perfect....was exactly the device I needed. Like finding an old friend. Thanks. 
25348 Clearly a winner. Heliopan was my first, but seeing the quality, this is now my choice 
25349 These are useful! Happy! 
25350 An Excellent replacement for the one I lost. Rating: 5 of 5 The item was well packaged and came quickly. Arrived on time and was as described. Very good quality and excellent value for the money. 
25351 Hands down best little strap I ve used. Construction is flawless and materials are top quality. I ve used them for a year now in my wedding work and the have not left my fuji s side! 
25352 Nice reflector, it s me first one, but it was of a great use on the wedding day , can cover at least 4 people if used to diffuse the harsh light on a sunny day. The quality seems good. 
25353 Works fine, arrived in plenty of time for a vacation trip. 
25354 I mainly bought this kit for the UV filter, but I will use the other filters also. I keep a UV filter on my lenses all the time, mainly to protect them. The filter is cheaper to replace if damaged that your lenses! 
25355 It s not very high quality when handling, but once installed you can t tell it s fake or that it is cheaply made. I would buy again. 
25356 So far so good, working well. 
25357 Just happy to have a backup battery for my camera.. 
25358 Everything good! 
25359 Nice but a bit pricey, only gripe is the case only fits the iPad mini. Should have a cutout for iPad or iPad Air. 
25360 Wonderful works with my Sony Hdr-mv1 
25361 Poor quality. Adhesive last maybe a month. I took my camera on trip to Alaska. Some days were misty and protector will not stay on in that weather. 
25362 I use this light with my ENG Camera and Film Camera. It is a great tool for handheld cameras, especially in field production. I enjoy the product. 
25363 Works great. Lasts for 3 lacrosse games (on & off) no problem. No issues with the camera not recognizing it. Useful review? Let me know! 
25364 Very nice camera. Works as advertised 
25365 Great price super easy to locate controls. Only downside is there is no external power input. 
25366 bought it for a Nikon D90 that I use as a backup. actually wanted an SB-600 but Nikon no longer makes it. works great. 
25367 Like orig. 
25368 Perfect mate for the one I had in the battery expansion. 
25369 This item stopped working soon after we got it, and kodak has stopped making this product. Now I have a product that is broken and I cant get a replacement. 
25370 BAD picture, bad sound, cant go far...I would NOT recommend this product. 
25371 Super sturdy and we love it! 
25372 It sucks. I try instslling them but right after i turned then on they would start going off after like 3 seconds withought separating them 
25373 We installed this at the door in the garage, and it s motion-sensitive, so when we come home after dark, we can always see the keyhole for our deadbolt! 
25374 Met expectations. Nice. 
25375 I like this strap very well. It is of a very good quality. I highly recommend this! 
25376 Nice light case. 
25377 Solid product. Several adapters to attach things. And the legs are made well. 
25378 works as needed 
25379 Did not work as specified. WiFi from device to station would only work when within 20 feet. Would not work with Verizon FIOS landline. Returned it and purchased an alternate system which worked fine. 
25380 Set up was a breeze - it took about ten minutes. Picture quality and features are amazing. User manual needs to be shipped with the camera. GREAT VALUE$$$ 
25381 I have owned several Samsung cameras and thought this one would be work just as well. It does not. It is much slower and the flash acts like it takes a while to &#34;warm up&#34; and snap the picture. Would not order this particular model camera again. 
25382 Great! 
25383 Perfect for those long trips 
25384 Excellent bag for traveling with my Canon T3i along with two lenses and charger. 
25385 Compact Sony kit lens for the NEX series that works very well - sharp enough. 
25386 Great. 
25387 I used this with a Stellarvue eyepiece that comes with their 13x80 finder. I liked that it had a broad range of brightness down to the point where the red crosshairs were extremely faint. 
25388 REALLY WORKS 
25389 Got these on time. It looks exactly as it is in the photo. 
25390 This is AWFUL!! Live Video Failed after 2 days worked. Any Model 
25391 All models of this brand camera I bought failed. 
25392 A very good lens fro macro photography 
25393 Although it serves my needs I was misled in the description of the product where it said it was an aluminum case it is really made of plastic 
25394 It hasn t worked since the day I took it out of the box. 
25395 kinda cheap. but so is the price. 
25396 Solidly made, threads work smoothly. Good craftsmanship. 
25397 not as expected 
25398 very good 
25399 Works well 
25400 never did work 
25401 Everything came as expected and in time too...looking forward to buying more of your products. 
25402 Nice little pouch! Lens slips inn nicely. Plenty of padding too. 
25403 Was not sure about this speedlight but I took a chance and I am glad I could. Works in manual only but the output is easily adjustable, and has good powder. Will purchase another. 
25404 THIS CAMERA BUNDLE IS A GREAT VALUE 
25405 IT LOOKS LIKE AND HAS THE FEATURES OF MORE EXPENSIVE CAMERAS. PLUS THE BONUS OF AN EXTRA BATTERY AND ANOTHER CHARGER AND CORDS. VERY GOOD BUY!!!!!! 
25406 Not that good. Barely holds the camera in place. 
25407 best duster ever 
25408 excellent product , work good , easy install , good sound 
25409 didn t work with any of my speedlites 
25410 Fits all my go pro items in one little pouch 
25411 works very good for my cannon 10d 
25412 a great Little security camera loaded with exceptional features 
25413 Use it to carry .223 shells on my sling. 
25414 Having a really hard time understanding how to work it, the manual is way to small to read. 
25415 Great on time! 
25416 After the first week night vision stopped working. Now it connects when it wants to. Zero customers service!!! 
25417 Works good - but switches from color to black and white for some reason. 
25418 Batteries are good but they dont last as long as the one I got with my camera 
25419 The best quality fish eye equivalent for the price. Highly recommended. 
25420 Nice camera. I m still learning how to use it. 
25421 fast shipping. i love the design and very fit. if you are looking for a protector for your camera, this one is recommended. 
25422 This item works well so far but it is NOT the US version. Based on other feedback I m afraid to do the firmware update. No problems so far but beware. 
25423 freezes up sometimes and i have to unplug it 
25424 Keeps the camera dry and is great to keep sticky fingerprints away. 
25425 Money s worth. 
25426 Good images but a little on the weighty side for off hand viewing. Defiantly need a tripod. Good buy. 
25427 Not the sharpest lens I have, but it works very well for what it is. 
25428 They fit perfectly and work great. Definitely worth the money to have a few extra or to replace any in need. Shipping did take a while but that s expected when coming from another country. 
25429 Great protection for your investment. 
25430 Really Good mini backpack for beginners! I love it! 
25431 NOW I CAN VIDEO AT PARTIES LONGER LOVE IT 
25432 The Vivitar batteries I ordered work perfectly in my Sony a58 camera, for a fraction of the price I would have paid for Sony brand batteries. The cleaning kit was a great bonus. I was especially impressed and delighted by the size and power of the dust blower. 
25433 Macro is crazy detailed get an exernal light source and you re good 
25434 Fun for grad nite prizes... 
25435 Great lens! 
25436 Great lens filter kit 
25437 Admirable piece of engineering. Almost everything perfect, but a proper quick release should be fantastic 
25438 Too wide for my neck. 
25439 Excellent hdtvi dvr system. No complaints what so ever. Easy to setup. Has the best free ddns service available (hiddns). Video quality is amazing. My customers love it. Shipping was a bit slow but worth it. 
25440 So far so good Used a couple of times. 
25441 Love it 
25442 No complaints 
25443 My mother wanted me to search for something for my brother-in-law s birthday. He s really into astronomy. She got him the same model binoculars for Christmas. My sister said that he loved both of the products. 
25444 Used these on a construction site to mount a time lapse camera. Solid. Stable. Works well. The screws are showing signs of rust, but it was outside for months. The mfgr could use stainless steel screws if they wanted to improve the design... 
25445 The package is too simple, for UV lens 
25446 Great product. This case fits our Nikon Coolpix S33 camera just right. There is a pocket inside for an extra battery and or memory card. Heavyweight construction. Comes with a long strap. Double zippers, and a Velcro belt loop. Not much else to be said. It s a great case. 
25447 Just what I was looking for. Excellent lens bag, sturdy, lightweight, looks amazing! Highly recommend! 
25448 Great product- works better than expected 
25449 Much smaller than pictured, it looks like the sticker wraps around, but it doesn t. 
25450 One of the sharpest prime lenses on the market. 
25451 Great battery, easy to install fixed my problem. Came super quick, easy to install, at a great price!! Will use this seller again!! thanks td 
25452 They were very nice and strong but they didn t work with my vision. I could see black on the sides interfering with my vision. I tried to adjust but I have a wide bridge and my eyes just wouldn t focus enough. For someone else, I highly recommend. 
25453 Too large for the camera styles listed in the description. I never use this carry case. 
25454 Purchased this camera for our honeymoon in Tahiti. We banged it around on the paddle boards, took it snorkeling, and on our 1st diving trip ( which was only 5 or 6 meters). It took great pictures and video! Definitely TOUGH as well. 
25455 A++++++ 
25456 Perfect grip when using this as a handheld mount but an excellent desk mount for your cameras. 
25457 I can buy real glass protectors for this price 
25458 Great batteries and great for back up batteries 
25459 Works well for connecting mic 
25460 I have several really good tripods but I found myself in a place without one. I ordered this just to get me through a simple photo shoot. I was really pleased at the quality and compactness of this tripod. 
25461 Love it. I use it for insurance inspections. It has an amazing zoom! 
25462 Great to be able to charge a second battery not in the camera. 
25463 Easy to load and shoot. The picture develops quickly and it is nice to have a &#34;physical&#34; picture to place into an album. 
25464 Terrible, came with a bolt that was too short, do completely unusable. More importantly, it wasted my time because I had to find an alternative + return this poorly kitted product. 
25465 Works well! 
25466 Happy with items!! 
25467 This fit my Tamron lens just as described. Great price and exactly what I needed after losing my lens cap. Very satisfied and the seller was very fast with shipping. 
25468 Perfect addition to the Canon Rebel package I received. 
25469 could not make it work, sent it back 
25470 Wish it would start recording when power was applied to the micro usb. Originally wanted it for dash cam but keep forgetting to start or stop it. Pic quality good kids had it in pool still works. 
25471 One of the screws for the attachment is already stripped out 
25472 Works pretty good. Few of the buttons are labled wrong 
25473 This bag is amazing. The color is a little uninspiring, but not at all bad. It s very well built. I have been using mine every single day for over a year and it is still showing no wear whatsoever, and I m not a great owner. 
25474 Worked 
25475 Nice basic mount. Does the job. 
25476 the item was exactly as pictured and described. it works perfectly on my camera. I am happy to have a charger so that I am able to use my camera once again. thank you for this listing 
25477 Just what was needed. 
25478 Great kit for the price, more than I will ever use. Some pieces are cheaply made though. 
25479 not bad it really works quite well.. even my 5 yr old grandson can operate this..!! The record button is really easy to use !! 
25480 Awesome camera great pictures and features 
25481 THE WIRELESS VIDEO SURVEILLANCE HAS STOPPED RECORDING 
25482 Works well, better than expected. 
25483 Very well made!! Great product!! 
25484 ok 
25485 Got the propellers within a few days. They are great 
25486 A low cost solution to start your photography hobby. Many position options and adjustments. Great for any beginner. 
25487 Great! 
25488 Let s see what this amounts to when the time comes. 
25489 great transaction. Product as described 
25490 We used the Sony HDR-CX3800 to make a product review video of this pet fountain. [[ASIN:B00YDFMQ8M Five Star Pet Fountain for Improved Pet Health. Cats & Dogs Drink More Water When It s Oxygenated & Filtered. Easy to Clean, Quiet Operation, One Gallon Waterer. Simple Solution for a Healthier Pet.]] 
25491 I recommend, fast delivery. very good 
25492 When the backdrop arrived it was as pictured but NOT as described 
25493 It should have been green/black according to the description. Also, because of the design, it is difficult to create/maintain a flat background. 
25494 No problems with product and/or delivery. Works on camera as described. 
25495 Great first microscope. 
25496 Works well. 
25497 Great! Just what I needed for this lens 
25498 Just as good as the name brand batteries. No problems at all. 
25499 Worked for about 2 seconds and with new batteries !! 
25500 the platform is plastic and will not hold any camera inline enough to get a decent image. you have to make changes to have it work. 
25501 Works very well, good quality pictures 
25502 good 
25503 Works well indoor and outdoor. I have not tried the Shutter release but the GPS works well on my Nikon D7100 
25504 I really like it...very versatile to carry laptop and camera 
25505 great 
25506 Great product. 
25507 this is the best and most stable tripod I have ever bought. 
25508 Not my best buy. 
25509 wayyyy to small , i thought it would be wider - can barely put the lens cap on 
25510 Good Price, great value should give me enough pwr for some long recording 
25511 I experienced quite a but if distortion around the edges with this on. 
25512 This bag is exactly what I was looking for. It has room inside for my laptop, camera, and all associated gear without being overly big. Great travel carry-on bag for all your electronics. It comes in different sizes so get the right size for your laptop. 
25513 I like this case,well padded, room for extra stuff, etc. 
25514 Love, love, love it. 
25515 Goes on great and protects a plastic (ugh!) screen. Much better than others I have used. A must have. 
25516 Works great. A nice and better replacer fid the original battery. The position of the battery on the charger can be confusing though since not all three prongs connect. 
25517 Got this for my son s GeekPro and everything in it worked great! We had a lot of fun with all the attachments on our vacation. Great product! 
25518 So far so good. Great service 
25519 For the money it is a very good deal! 
25520 Great can b used for number of things.Thx very much. 
25521 Takes great pictures, but i wish it wouldn t run out of battery so quickly. 
25522 A nice size card that fits in my gadget bag nicely. 
25523 There shouldn t be any functionality problem since it is just air blower but I couldn t stand the strong odor from the rubber pump. I can t use or store it because of the smell. 
25524 The protector works great, after 8 months it is still on the camera! Great service would use seller again! 
25525 Good 
25526 Love it 
25527 The video quality is poor, otherwise it is a great system. I use it for home security and I am impressed with it thus far. Just wish that the video quality was better. 
25528 Great camera case used with high quality fabrics. 
25529 Quality product. I love it. 
25530 Good quality cables, great price. 
25531 Love the tripod and blue tooth clicker. It made family beach pictures so much easier until the screw got crossthreaded, or something, in the plastic hold to hold the camera at a tilt. I m not sure how that happened b/c I hadn t messed with it. 
25532 Flimsy and falls off too often. 
25533 Great buy works perfect very happy 
25534 Fantastic!!! 
25535 Works as described I recommend.Be sure to have it plugged into your router with an Ethernet cable when you first configure it. Once configured it works fine over Wi-Fi. It just can t be initially configured over Wi-Fi. 
25536 Received on time.. Product quality is good for the price.. Thanks.. 
25537 Did what it was supposed to; arrived in a timely manner. 
25538 Very Nice & well made & Really like the way it Works ! Great ! ! 
25539 Great package. Great product 
25540 good not great 
25541 Great bargain. Quality product. 
25542 i got the shots i wanted with this filter. no problems. 
25543 too much on this thing, but an idiot like me can take goods pics it must be ok 
25544 Might be a little to petite for a professional that relies on many mounts and casings, but for a single case and knowing what mount you were to use this is practical. Hard casing helps to protect but hard to pack into a backpack if limited space. 
25545 Easy, fast, safe and comfortable! 
25546 Interface could be better, but it works well enough 
25547 This bag has replaced all of my bags. I literally take this everywhere I go now. Trust me, it is worth it. 
25548 Very happy with items. 5 STARS AND great product. 
25549 Everything was as promised. Thanks! 
25550 I lost my spare battery somewhere between a session, an event and home. Thankfully I was able to find the exact battery and have it delivered quickly. 
25551 This kit was everything I expected. It fits my camera great. I ve used most of the body gear parts and selfie stick already. I m having a blast putting together my videos. The case makes it easy to keep things together. 
25552 My granddaughter loves it. 
25553 Nice price 
25554 Henry was a great help with the wifi connection! Not having access to the router definitely made things difficult, but not impossible. Happy to be able to watch the pups from home and not having to worry. Glad its connected finally. Thanks to Henry! case id# c6721161henry AR004273 
25555 Not compatable to a mac 
25556 The battery worked just as expected, and you CANNOT beat the price! I did not notice any degradation in quality compared to the one I have that came with my camera. 
25557 I recommend. 
25558 This camera works great and the picture is clear. This is a great product and hopefully i get my moneys worth out of it, if it has any problems. I highly recommend this camera 
25559 great price holds charge like dream 
25560 VERY HANDY LOVE IT AND THESSE ARE ALLOWED ON ANY DISNEY RIDE 
25561 Decent protector. I have used this brand before and have been happy 
25562 Nice and sturdy 
25563 Works great! 
25564 Case Number: C6725987 Tech ID: AR004273 Description about my service experience with the technician was extremely helpful in setting up both of my Dlink cameras. He was the best technician I have ever worked with over the phone. 
25565 Not the greatest design but adequate 
25566 Wow! Great printer and great color! I take lots of pictures on my phone and DSLR and having a portable printer is super convenient and fun! People are amazed at the quality of the prints and Ive had a lot of questions about where I bought them! 
25567 thank you for this order 
25568 Works great! 
25569 I replaced a Sony A350 with this camera. I am very happy with the Sony A58 camera. I am more about taking photos than using the video that it has... I guess one day I will try that out, but for now, it s all about good photos. 
25570 Everything is in excelent condition, it came with 32 gb sd card and sony bag. One of the best deals ever! 
25571 it is a great one specially for quick and easy shots. video is great except battery life is too short in that case. I used it during my vacation to London and i had a great like processional photos 
25572 Arrived promptly, in quality pkging. All worked, no issues. 
25573 so far great price and performance. 
25574 I highly recommend this item. 
25575 Product arrived quickly. Batteries work great in my Samsung camera. The charger & 2 spare batteries give me more options than just plugging in my camera and waiting for a recharge. Order from this company. You will be pleased and amused. :) 
25576 did exactly what it was supposed to do 
25577 Works very nicely with my my scope. 
25578 worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks. 
25579 Brief comment is really all that s necessary. I bought the product, and it works perfectly. Furthermore, it s way cheaper than buying the branded battery from Canon. Definitely recommended. 
25580 Exactly what I was looking for. Sturdy construction, fast setup/take-down and I get the results I expect with it. And love the ball head mount - much better than I expected for this price. Couldn t be happier. 
25581 Everything was there and in good shape. Very happy with order. 
25582 Not sure I understood utilizing this product with my 85 Carl Zeis lens would leave it in manual. Frustrating sometimes. I will prob just use my Sony body. 
25583 Works awsome 
25584 Just what I needed for a short notice event. All the basics for low drama preparation. 
25585 Good Buy 
25586 works very well just what i wanted 
25587 works well, delivered quickly. no complaints. 
25588 ok 
25589 Very versatile works as expected. 
25590 High quality video, audio is very good. Had a few times where the video/audio cut out, but that was most likely due to a dodgy internet connection. Just make sure you ve got a WiFi extender and you shouldn t have any streaming interruptions. 
25591 Product was as described. Transaction was smooth. 
25592 Love it!! 
25593 Love, Love, Love, Love, Love!!!! Really nothing else to say...I have NO regrets about purchasing this camera!!! It s a blast to use and footage is amazing in and out of water, on moving vehicles, on moving pets, for stills, and anything you can imagine. 
25594 Came as promised. A lot of great accessories! 
25595 Love taking pictures with it for the first time. For an amateur, I like the speed for taking pictures. I still have to explore the many features of this camera. 
25596 Coool 50mm prime... use it all the time to create unique perspectives 
25597 Broke after 4 uses 
25598 Bought for my friends trip to Africa & didn t even work, Says needed Battery or something:( 
25599 Horrible product. I haven t even had this bag for 3 months and the zippers already broke off. Also to inforce that I have not used it often. The worst bag I ve had. 
25600 Great camera....love the Jpegs right out of the camera. The film simulations are spectacular! Use this camera and a Pentax Kiis....combo give me full photo flexibility.. 
25601 I can focus it at trees leaves and random daylight 
25602 rec d as promised and as advertised 
25603 Work OK little low on life of battery 
25604 A little smaller than expection. 
25605 metal and good fit for filters 
25606 Great unit for the money, easy to operate 
25607 Soft and girlie, loved this neck strap for our honeymoon in Ireland. Much better than that Nikon strap! Held my Nikon 3200 perfectly in place for the entire trip. 
25608 use it for the fujifilm xp70 
25609 Great lens cap, great value. 
25610 Love the colors and the price. Fits around neck comfortably. I got a compliment on the color while taking pictures on the street. 
25611 Great 
25612 I bought this cap for a Fujifilm Finepix S9200. It s well made and very nice, and I received it quickly. However it does not fit the lens. I need to send it back. 
25613 very good quality. love the carrying case! 
25614 so fun and cute! 
25615 Did what it needed too. 
25616 Richard Excellent support setting up the camera for remote viewing. Thank you. Camera is great. Doing exactly what I wanted. 
25617 It s an excellent product that beyond I expect. 
25618 Good size bag. Pretty comfortable to carry around. Not too obvious that it is a camera bag. 
25619 works well 
25620 It prevents good sound recording but keeps the water from getting into the device 
25621 Great on planets but blurs more distant objects 
25622 These are so nice and easy to take off and put on. 
25623 admitible 
25624 love it all. No problems. 
25625 Arrived quickly. Good illumination control from the dial. Little heavy with the batteries. Good product. 
25626 Saw double not in adjustment 
25627 Easy to fly. Would like to see longer range. 
25628 works well. 
25629 Bought this GoPro Travel and Carrying Case for my son s new GoPro4 and he loves it. 
25630 Works as expected batteries seem to work good so far as well. This charger is nice because you get a charger and two batteries. If you tried to get canon original batteries and charger this same deal would be over 150 dollars, so this is a no brainer. 
25631 I was very pleased with my purchase. I bought it for my nephew for his 18th bday and he loved it. Very well made and has plenty of padding and straps for carrying. Would recommend. 
25632 You can t beat the price,not bad video. 
25633 It provides good IQ and it reduces the size of the whole set so it fits into my pocket now!! 
25634 So far so good. 
25635 Works great! Just the right size, too. 
25636 I tried to use these according to the instructions and I still can t seem to get the quality out of them that I was hoping to get. They are made well so I ll give it two stars, but I really don t like how they work. 
25637 Thanks 
25638 NOTE: NO LEGS It would be unfair to mark it 4 stars. It is exactly what it claims to be, but it really needs some fold out legs for indoor usage. 2 stands and clamps work for a quick setup. 
25639 Wide viewing angle. Night vision is good but can be better ( compared to the camera I have from ADT). Overall, it is a good camera and worth the price paid for. 
25640 A OK..... 
25641 works well 
25642 Great price fast survive 
25643 Takes a long time to &#34;charge&#34; for each flash. 
25644 It came deformed... Not very helpful when it shows up in the frame due to its deformation. I would not recommend this. 
25645 richard helped me with setting everything up. its soooo simple and easy and now i can watch my apartment from my latop or my phone for free! i love this camera. the quality is amazing 
25646 Excellent 
25647 This item was better than what I thought it would be and I am very please. This looks very elegant and made of a thick cloth not like the thin ones that I have seen. 
25648 fits perfectly 
25649 Very easy to set up , only thing is that it only records at 960 not hd , so no need to buy hd cameras 
25650 Amazing price. Good camera fit with a couple of extra pockets. Sharp looking with Nikon emblem. 
25651 Perfect! Exactly as described! Thank you! 
25652 Given as a gift, recipient was extremely happy 
25653 Awesome product! Everything is perfect! 
25654 Perfect fit for my new Panasonic FZ-70. Charged perfectly and have tried both batteries, everything is good. The lens cloth and brush are nice bonuses too! 
25655 Don t buy 
25656 Great camera will buy again 
25657 Remote release cord functions perfectly; replicates the shutter release button on my D7100 in every way. 
25658 I have to change my review....I just returned the frame....when I was sitting right by it, the pics were great....once I moved it across the room and at a different level....it was hard to see ....a lot of black spots. Our original nix was not like that..... 
25659 Works fine but still need a stand. 
25660 Great product, prompt delivery. Love the clear pouches for storing the cleaning cloths! 
25661 So much better than changing batteries. Motor runs faster than with battery power 
25662 Good little pack here, but the mono pod stick isn t all that great. I ve seen better ones, no control button on the handle end. But you get what you pay for 
25663 Good materials and exactly the right size I needed, for a nikon d3200 + battery grip + 55-200mm lens. 
25664 Very easy to use. Great video quality, in a very small package. Would definitely recommended to anyone looking for a camera that is easy to conceal. 
25665 This case adds protection and a nice look of refinement. The con is that it makes it a little harder to get the SD card out. 
25666 only they used, and they are broke or not working where I can send it to the fix, since it has a one year warranty I am looking forward to your response Thank you nelson 
25667 arrived as expected. Works well. Good product. 
25668 Pretty good. Works as described. I wish there was a way to reverse it 
25669 easy to use and great quality. 
25670 Does a great job when used with the zeiss lense care cleaner 
25671 This is an excellent &#34;bean bag&#34; for photograhy use. Is made to last and the Neoprene surface prevents slippage. Filled mine with one bag 32oz (907grams) of Fairfield Poly-Pellets Stuffing Beads which are sold by Amazon. The bag s maker LensCoat has a line of first-rate products. 
25672 Perfect Replacement on my Canon Rebel. 
25673 Poor product! When I play back my videos it glitches hard. Over heats too 
25674 Works great- all functions very compatible and highly recommend 
25675 I installed the update from their web site and the unit does not work now. I have tried to contact them about the problem and have not received a reply. Sent them another email today I hope to hear soon. 
25676 Very cheaply built. This tripod is very flimsy and barely supports the weight of my camera. The level feature doesn t even have any liquid in it. Please do not buy this tripod. You will only end up disappointed. 
25677 Nicely fitting case. 
25678 Doesn t charge 
25679 Impressed with Value, Quality and quickness of shipping. 
25680 This is a great rolling camera case. Holds everything I need for photographing weddings. 
25681 awesome, sure took a lot of pics under water 
25682 Perfect 
25683 I returned mine. The rain bag is HUGE. Not usable for a mirrorless ILC camera. The quality feels cheap and would ve been cumbersome to use even if it did fit. 
25684 Fits perfect, and works great. 
25685 Vincent Did a wonderful job on getting the camera working properly in a short time!! Wish I could get him again if/when I need help!! 
25686 Excellent product at a great price. Plugs into the wall, has a car charger, cheaper than the Nikon branded charger. I don t see why you would opt for anything else! 
25687 Very nice well padded camera bag but to large for my point and shoot camera. 
25688 Perfect 
25689 it floats - easy to see in water, pool, lake and ocean! must go with bright orange colors! 
25690 Yes it is what it is. 
25691 Great camera! 
25692 Terrible product. They do not fir American cassette players 
25693 As advertised 
25694 They do not fit the camera at all. 
25695 it is okay for the price. Accomplishes the purpose of keeping an eye on my dog outside. After four months I ve had some wifi connectivity issues where i have to reboot the camera. 
25696 works just fine, but the batteries seem to have a short life 
25697 Product Arrived on time and intact.Thank you........Mike 
25698 excelete 
25699 A really great buy! So reliable, reasonably priced. Really keeps everything organized and protected. Wonderful for having a lot of equipment and yet wonderfully simple. My only downside is that I wish it came in different colors or designs. 
25700 it was perfect 
25701 like the size but doesn t always stay in one place.. 
25702 Good quality and good price. Very satisfied. 
25703 El19 charger adapter does Not even come close to fitting el19 battery!! Who built this a three year old? Worthless device!! 
25704 Wasn t able to get it to work with my Canon 5D at all. Tried all the troubleshooting tips I could find online, YouTube videos, etc. Finally ended up returning it. 
25705 This prime makes you work for the shot. The bokeh is crazy and depth of field is very narrow. Perfect for dreamy, ethereal work made from afar. Minimum focal distance is about 6 .... 
25706 Works great!!! 
25707 Good as described 
25708 great it was well worth the purchase, the camera is now outdated needs to be replaced 
25709 Gift - recipient loved it! 
25710 Excellent 
25711 5 stars for the price 
25712 I have not used all the lenses yet so really can t give a fair review, however, I love the kit and carry it with me in my camera bag, I especially like the microfiber cloth for cleaning my camera and the lenses. It does a great job! 
25713 good clear picture. will use as a security camera when I go on vacation. 
25714 fukky The plastic ring that is attached to the hand string on the extension pole broke and my go pro fell 35 feet down. Thankfully one of the catamaran workers was a crazy free diver and went and got it. 
25715 Whenever you use this lens for Indore shooting with standards flash you get this lens shadow on pictures captured at below 35mm focal length. You have to use external flash light or capture without flash. Useful only for outdoor shooting without using standard flash. 
25716 A well made quality camera sling. At first, it can be a little tricky in using the optional armpit strap, but once you become familiar with it, you are good to go, without slippage that you get from other camera slings. 
25717 I got these in the mail and all of the Capacitors were bent over. after Testing I carefully moved the capacitors back into place and tested again and they all still worked. Rating would be higher if packaged a little differently but for the price I couldn t complain. 
25718 Always buy this products do is good , for some reason this time picture where no good, we waist half pack, picture never look good :( 
25719 Love it. Takes great pictures at a portable size. I love being out door, hiking, boating, jet skis, four wheeling, etc and this camera is great for travel. I can slip it in my pocket and go go go and get awesome pics too. :) 
25720 Perfect 
25721 perfecto 
25722 It is what it is. I m still learning how and where and when I will use it , but it serves my originally intended purpose very well and is fairly sturdy. 
25723 great item and fast shipping 
25724 GOOD BIRD 
25725 This is the best slider I ever had. It s short to carry, extends on a tripod, super smooth ride for awesome shots. Wide rails can hold heavier load. Inexpensive, well built, and it s pleasure to work with it. I rate it A+++. 
25726 This will make it so much easier to take pics. works great 
25727 Thank You 
25728 Fits great` 
25729 Excellent value. I have a GoPro but this excellent value allows me to place a camera in more dangerous locations with less concern. Mask works great also. 
25730 It worked so well that I bought two more. 
25731 excelent 
25732 Wow! I am really impressed with the quality! It is very sturdy and solid. The tripod is heavy, so I don t see myself lugging this thing around on a nature walk, but I knew that from the other reviews. 
25733 Exceptional quality, performance, and guarantees. The filters from this great company are now the best ones I m using. 
25734 Great purchase! Just remember you need to manual focus...no big deal for me. 
25735 worked grate 
25736 Awesome camera & bundle! 
25737 A unique solution that was very much needed. Been using it for months now and it hasn t broke. Very surprising given what this thing is 
25738 Works great 
25739 Excellent bulbs. Very bright, doesn t get very hot & no buzzing. 
25740 Solid case. Tight seal. Fits Gopro, battery charger, plug and two batteries easily. Carabiner is cheap, but I swapped it out for an s-biner. Clear lid is nice if you have multiple boxes that are the same color. 
25741 Good product and fit at an affordable price. Only negative is it took over a month to ship from China. 
25742 Doesn t hold a charge as well as the battery that came with the drone. 
25743 Didn t fit the Canon Mark II as advertised (requires an adapter). Misleading BS and it s overpriced. 
25744 Does its job 
25745 Wow great item for great price 
25746 I received a tripod that has been used and has scratches all over. I didn t return it yet because I feel lazy of going through the return process. 
25747 There is a big problem to installing it without a detailed English instruction manual; for example: the function and connecting the J1,J2 and J3 terminals. 
25748 Hooked it up prior to installing and everything looks good 
25749 10 points. everything was as expected 
25750 Good camera, especially you don t need remember about battery charging. Just keep extra 4 AA with you. Quality is great for this price, well you are not buying a $1000 camera, so don’t expect more for this money. 
25751 Exactly what I need for pictures 
25752 cheap and good 
25753 In case your camera lenses are vampires like mine. 
25754 Nice addition to the camera bag. This along with the STK aftermarket batteries have been extremely reliable (just as good as the factory units). 
25755 This is such a cute camera!! 
25756 A good product. 
25757 It s so small so it s kind of hard to focus in on an object. Not very pleased with it. 
25758 I ordered this because I ve always wanted a polaroid. Best purchase I ve ever made! It came very quickly, and is so cute! Definitely worth the money I payed for it! 
25759 as advertised 
25760 Does the job, but very hard to find the right focus. 
25761 It s perfect 
25762 Bought this for my Pentax k-50 with 18-55mm lens. Fits snugly and works just fine. Note: This is for the weather resistant form of the lens, from what I understand this will not fit the non-WR lens. 
25763 As advertised. Works great for sunsets. 
25764 I absolutely love these little lenses... I have had fun playing around. My favorite is the macro lens and here is an image where it was used. My phone is iPhone 6 plus... 
25765 it does not fucus well, bought it for fy son s 8th grade promotion... and ended it taking pictures with my phone, they came out better with my phone :( 
25766 I love it.!!! 
25767 My Daughter love this, I gave it to her for her 11th birthday 
25768 fake leather.screw not work on tripod 
25769 I received my camera today and was very pleased with it. It arrived earlier than anticipated, it was the best priced camera and had the most accessories included. I can t wait to try it out this weekend with the family! 
25770 Lights up the area I wanted it to 
25771 Plenty of room for my scope and camera with several lenses 
25772 Shows black and white and no wireless. 
25773 Really happy with this case. It holds my Samsung point-and-shoot. Has a small pocket for cords or cards. Just perfect. 
25774 I ve had this for a few years now and it has never given me a bit of trouble. The only complaint I have is that I wish it had a feature to reorient an individual picture. 
25775 the best choice for pro photo shoot 
25776 Works good in my Canon VIXIA HFR20. Gives battery time remaining on the screen. So camera thinks it s a Canon battery. 
25777 Good price-good product-fast delivery. 
25778 My videos and images are of poor contrast and lots of noises even in good light, don t know if this the case with others or not. 
25779 Great selfie stick, I love it 
25780 well after using this the first time I needed to order a new Panasonic ZS40 to replace my ZS20 Youz can guess the rest anyway hate to upgrade that way 
25781 If you re gonna drop the money for the T5, get this bundle. The extras are good quality, and the extra lens makes this an awesome deal. 
25782 a gift 
25783 Pictures were nice and functioned under water. However some of the pictures look blurry. 
25784 Works perfectly. Helps get the best shot and is super sturdy! 
25785 Works great! 
25786 I did plenty of research and this was a great deal. I was also happy the bag was Canon brand. Although the 16 gig memory card was corrupted after just 4 uses??!! 
25787 The real deal! 
25788 very happy good product 
25789 Everything Ok! Thanks 
25790 Great little package, easy to mount and install...Thanks 
25791 Workout great 
25792 Exactly what I needed for my Tamron 70-200 mm 2.8. Fits with lens hood and collar. Nice quality and protects lens well. 
25793 not bad for the price, not the best quality. 
25794 did not fit 
25795 Amazing! My husband love stargazing but doesn t like to pull out our big telescope all the time this has been perfect for him. I would definitely reccomend a good tripod with this to get the clearist view. 
25796 This tripod is great for a point and shoot. I used it in a pinch to set my dslr on, but don t trust it. 
25797 Good 
25798 Leg support came apart after a few weeks and the little handle broke. 
25799 Good veiw 
25800 5 stars because you can t beat the value for price. I filmed a time lapse first chance I got and loved the results. Using the wifi mode a huge plus. 
25801 Very nice product.....! 
25802 First of all, don t advertise a specific color when it isn t available. If I wanted a pink one, I would have ordered a pink one. I didn t even bother checking quality because I m so disappointed with the color. 
25803 I got this so I can be able to load up my photos on my computer. 
25804 Works great on my t3i. Love how the photos turn out with this lens. It s a lot heavier than I expected to be. Not really a problem though. 
25805 Our family loves hiking and this makes even the younger one to go on one 
25806 Very comfortable on delicate skin of younger kids too 
25807 The memory card that it comes with is not a micro card. 
25808 great Quality and great Service it fit my Camera perfect give it a try. 
25809 This is the gift for my mom and she loves it. But the automatically turn on/off function is not working. 
25810 This was everything I needed it to be. It is a great small Tripod good for webcam or still digital camera. It holds the camera steady and is easy to adjust. 
25811 Does the job. Takes quick photos and prints them out. So glad I have this camera. :) 
25812 Great value!!!! 
25813 love it It makes my camera larger and easy to hold... 
25814 waste of money 
25815 Got exactly what was advertised. Fit like a glove. Now I have a replacement!! Great deal! 
25816 Great item! The set is definitely worth the cost. 
25817 I give this product 3 stars because the tripod broke after 2 days I had the tripod, I read the reviews about it and they were true. The other reason why is that the quality of the camera isn t too good but I still like it. 
25818 Works as intended. Fast delivery. If you need a portable light, you can not go wrong with this one. 
25819 Very nice case. Only reason it didn t get a &#34;5&#34; was it needed to be a little bigger for me. Fine quality case though. 
25820 Perfect gift, daughter loved it 
25821 Perfect fit. 
25822 It s very very good, buy it !!!! 
25823 I am going to send the product back. It will not do what I bought it for. I wanted to use it for surveillance looking through a window to the outside and the picture quality just is not there. 
25824 Product is as advertised. 
25825 Fine! It s just a charger! 
25826 BE CAREFUL! It is good, if you have little camera and you need it just sometimes at family meetings and don´t want to spend money for expensife stuff, but for middle-sized cameras it´s absolutely terrible. For active photographing it´s too weak! 
25827 The product arrived right on time. I used the charger to charge the old battrey, and it worked great. The &#34;charging light&#34; and &#34;fully changed light&#34; worked as they should. Good product so far. 
25828 Product broke as soon as I opened it. The part the camera sits on comes off now and I can t seem to fix it.. 
25829 I ordered several lenses from Digital Goja. Everything was great. I wouldn t hesitate to order more from them in the future. 
25830 Awesome product 
25831 What can be said about a mobius that hasn t been said already? Great picture, light, and easy to mount in a variety of locations. Wish I hadn t waited so long to buy one. 
25832 it works o.k. thank you dan 
25833 This is a must buy for observing the moon. The moon is incredibly bright. Good quality filter fits right on any 1.25&#34; EP. 
25834 Awesome camera for the price! I snorkel with it twice a week. Underwater shots are amazing! 
25835 I love this camera, exactly what im looking for. I used so much for street photography, my travels and partys, everything in one camera. I just I love t. 
25836 It is perfect for my camera! Great and fast service! 
25837 Good for the price - works well 
25838 Seem very durable. Wish you could pick the color. I got the white ones. 
25839 Excellent. Works great for my camera! 
25840 the light doesnt work 
25841 Arrived quickly and fits my Sony @6000 perfectly. 
25842 This is great for a day trip and if you don t want to carry a lot of lenses. very comfortable to wear. 
25843 Everithing was as I expected 
25844 Fits tight, but that s how I like it. Case comes with a shoulder strap, main pocket for the camera, and outer pocket for memory cards and batteries. Works great at a great price 
25845 Very happy with my product and fast shipping 
25846 I really love this filter. It is so much better then stacking filters. All you have to do is dial in the darkness you want and shoot 
25847 GOOD! 
25848 Dont have batteries 
25849 Kit was ok, but bag was smaller than I expected. 
25850 Works great! Easily charges my GoPro battery. 
25851 Received shattered screen twice. Amazon/seller was quick to refund my purchases, but it suffices to say, I will not be ordering another one. I wouldn t classify this item as &#34;ultra durable.&#34; 
25852 This is a great camera. I take it everywhere with me. It takes great pictures and has an easy to understand layout for us novices. 
25853 Does what it s supposed to. 
25854 If you re 3 inches away from the &#34;camera&#34;, the motion detector works great. You get what you pay for. I bought 2 and only one works. 
25855 nice 
25856 Saw comment from someone else that charger was cheap plastic....so big deal. It works great and the batteries charge fine. I am absolutely satisfied for this battery pack and charger. 
25857 Fits my Pentax K50 perfectly. No issues. 
25858 The product arrived quickly and works very well. I have a three-story town home, and it keeps me from having to climb up and down the stairs to talk. 
25859 I think this might be the best lens money can buy, if you only have $50 to spend on a lens. 
25860 This gopole is lightweight and durable. Has held up from many high impact falls. Collapses small enough to pack in a backpack. 
25861 Nice LITTLE LED light for cell phone, good value and good price. It was made for iPhone 4s, included a 4s case. You will probably use the lights only and throw away the case. 
25862 Perfect 
25863 great value 
25864 It s ok. 
25865 Excellent quality, feels very solid excellent picture. Easy to set up. A word of caution: make sure you restart your router and camera after making changes to your router and camera settings. It will make your life easier. 
25866 Absolutely love this lens. Got it for a Canon Rebel T3i and it is amazing! LOVE it. Would definitely recommend. 
25867 Works with Piper system... took a while to get connected but it finally got up and running and works great! 
25868 This is a great buy but if you haven t got your Phantom yet buy the Phantom kit with 2 batteries and save some money. 
25869 Compact size, perfect. 
25870 So far so good. it really need a powerful memory card tho. 
25871 Works well! 
25872 Excelent 
25873 Great for weddings 
25874 Works fine. Like most products it could use a better manual. 
25875 Seems to successfully charge the Ricoh GR also, for those that may be wondering. Your mileage may vary but it seems compatible with the otherwise difficult to find proprietary in-camera charging cable. 
25876 Coolpix indeed. Great 20mp pix with Nikon simple (if you read instructions) focusing. 
25877 Does what I expect a tiny tripod to do. Holds my T3i well, but usually it sits under my GoPro or Contour+2. Feels like pretty solid construction. 
25878 Great 
25879 its good for what it is but I should have bought a longer zoom 
25880 My husband and I are professional photographers and we both love these. They leave camera lenses (and eyeglasses!) lint free and the price is awesome. Great product. Excellent service. 
25881 Drone is fantastic! The seller did a great job in shipping it quickly. This being a 4K camera you ll have to put it in JPEG or some other format for others to view your video. 
25882 Extremely impressed by the quality of the drone and the images we have been able to capture. HIGHLY recommended! 
25883 Works good so far. 
25884 good 
25885 Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found that it fits fine. One star off because it s not quite Canon quality, but then again it s not Canon Price either. Good looking and works, for a reasonable price. 
25886 Amazing for the money! 
25887 Love it! 
25888 Nice camera and its construction looks and feels solid. I like its features and although I am an amateur photographer it helps me to take nice pictures. 
25889 good coverage. user friendly. good quality video. 
25890 Great piece of equipment, got it for my wife. 
25891 Great camera. Comes with lens cap and neck strap. Great photos. This really takes great pictures and really looks and works like a brand new camera. Would definitely recommend. 
25892 great modifier, good quality 
25893 Worst kit ever!! Because of those accessories I lost my gopro! 
25894 If you don t want to spend the big bucks for name brand batteries, these are definitely for you. Great price, great packaging, and no problems at all with either of the batteries. 
25895 Cut to the chase, you pretty much get what you pay for here, the quick release plate lever is very weak and flimsy... 
25896 Good one 
25897 I had previously purchased a T5 from The Imaging World and was very pleased with the service and fast shipping. I am still breaking in my new 70D and the purchase experience was once again excellent. 
25898 Great for a low cost alternative. Most useful in the sun. 
25899 Bought to keep as a spare. Arrived just before I broke a bulb. 
25900 I am really enjoying my camera but the best part is the service in setting it up. 
25901 very happy with this, nice upgrade from my Spyder 2 
25902 Greatt 
25903 Does what it s supposed to do and does it at a cheap price. Can t go wrong. I use this on my Nikon D3300 
25904 Exactly what we needed and works great! 
25905 Images are faded not sharp and clear. I should have bought a spotting scope with a camera attachment. 
25906 everything was great!! 
25907 These are worth every penny, I also shoot with alien bees and Einstein. These will perform perfect for anyone starting out that does not want to spend a lot of money right away. 
25908 Works great, no fuss. Standard 2-flat-prone connector for the US as well as car charger and EU adaptor as stated. 
25909 The grip does not match the photo. It does not have the &#34;thumb joystick toggle&#34; or the other button. It feels poorly made and is clearly not a quality clone of the Canon vertical grip for the 7d mkII 
25910 I would have given it 5 stars if I wasn t missing the thread adapter I have to now go get one from Home Depot myself :/ other than that the build quality is superb for this price 
25911 Takes good pictures 
25912 Flimsy, tons of bubbles (and i applied correctly), not very strong adhesive 
25913 Not bad. Does the job. The pin hole for the video is more obvious than I would like but no one has noticed it yet. 
25914 They are the best comparing to any price point. The 15X50 are ideal all the way to as close as 15 feet. Not heavy as some have said. You can read reviews all day long as I did, you will not find a better pair anywhere! 
25915 Complete package deal! 
25916 Works and fits very well. Wayyyyy cheaper than really right stuff brand that is similar. Fits all really right stuff ball heads and mefoto heads 
25917 Works great! Thank you! 
25918 Everything was good but it did not contain the yellow float, so we had to go buy one for another twenty dollars. 
25919 Works good, but is flimsy and bends easily, if your camera is over a pound or so the tripod becomes unstable. 
25920 The cameras are great. They do exactly what I needed. 
25921 This is a great bag,just what I was looking for! 
25922 Good 
25923 A great purchase. If I bought it again, though, I would purchase the larger one. It is difficult to fold up, though. Look for a tutorial on youtube and plan to take a few times before you figure it out. 
25924 I ve used this lens with a d3200 and it makes the pictures look stunning. This lens produces sharp and detailed images. This is a bang for your buck because you can t beat the price. 
25925 Highly Recommended !! 
25926 Very good camera 
25927 Works great. Only drawback is that it is a large heavy piece of equipment. 
25928 Great camera, great pictures, easy to use. 
25929 Excellent 
25930 Awesome unit. The technology this has is amazing! Should cost thousands more! Does everything it says it doeas and more. Pics are beyond belief! Don t be scared, my 5 year old grandson can fly it! 
25931 Better pictures with this. Should have had one long ago 
25932 thicker walls than original. fits great. 
25933 The waterproof housing is foolproof. The picture quality is excellent. And, it s easy to use. 
25934 Excelent product 
25935 The glasses are awesome. The video and audio are exactly what I was hoping for, and the simplicity of using the glasses a huge bonus. 
25936 I was recording a video of me plowing my driveway and this microphone recorded even when I was inside the truck and more than 60 feet away! 
25937 Excellent lens! 
25938 These are just as good as the original GoPro batteries and seem to last just as long if not a little longer. I ve been using these for about 2 months now with no problems to date. 
25939 Panhead broke in just one use. VERY weak. I can t purchase the panhead alone. But what do you expect for $16. 
25940 Worked great. Needed for a speech class in college and worked without a hiccup. 
25941 I love this pack. Its very well built, fits my Phantom 3, Canon 7D, 24-700, 70-200, 50 1.2, and all needed accessories. So nice to have everything in one bag. Great product! 
25942 Batteries arrived on time and fit into my D90 perfectly and are just what I needed 
25943 ITS JUST A a bigger version of a micro usb 
25944 Love this little album. It will be perfect for a guest book at my daughter s Jamaica wedding.!!! 
25945 Great bundle! Especially awesome considering I was headed to Europe with it and it already had a converter! 
25946 Somewhat usable, constantly have to make adjustments and re tighten parts of the rig that easily become loose. Rig is very front heavy when assembled with any serious camera set up. I need at least 10 pounds on my shoulder to balance it. 
25947 Very Powerful, but heavy 
25948 Great lines. The low light performance isn t the best but that s not really what it is for. The zoom range is excellent. 
25949 For the price its a decent value. Only wish O could afford better glass 
25950 Used these for a DIY Photobooth we put together for our wedding. Everyone loved them! Really easy to put together, but I recommend using a glue gun versus the glue tabs that it comes with. 
25951 Works great. For all the reviewers that complain about it only facing one direction: try turning the pole..... 
25952 Very smooth and solid !!! The slider is very smooth, didn’t need any adjustment. You can use the screw(package included) to connect your dslr camera, but i recommend you to connect with a ball head. Cause it will be more flexiable to operate. 
25953 Replaced the pick and pluck after a month. Went with the padded dividers for on set use. I can put the pick and pluck back in when I fly. 
25954 Great cable 
25955 Gave this one as a gift and it was well received. 
25956 These are not bad but the fit with the clips is very very tight. I have had to grind off a few high points to get them to work. My next order I ll spend the extra money for the gopro clips. 
25957 Did not work!!!!!! 
25958 Works, awesome for it s price, if you zoom out completely u will have dark edges,and I don t bother made a lead many great picd 
25959 cheap for what it is 
25960 I have shot some of the most amazing videos with this camera. Excellent quality, and very, very durable. 
25961 Got it on time. Has everything I need. Looks and works great on my bike. Great value for the price. Very happy! 
25962 Best 50mm lense ive used so far. Its really quite. Takes very sharp pictures, great addition to my Canon 70D! 
25963 This is a present to the world. 
25964 thanks!) 
25965 my nephew live it! thanx 
25966 Quality product, just as described. 
25967 Works great for small things to photograph. 
25968 I wanted something very minimal for a very small camera (Fujifilm X100 series), and this fits the bill perfectly. The swivels work as advertised - no more tangles! 
25969 love it! 
25970 Everything went ok with it ! 
25971 Works find for my 72 lens. for the price can t beat it. T 
25972 The 3 prongs are too tight, so it s really hard to get the camera in there. Also the plastic around the ball is really cheap and looks like it can break at any time. Overall not good. 
25973 A+ 
25974 Excellent backup to the provided fastener that came with my black rapid camera strap. Now I have a fastener for both if my camera bodies 
25975 Works great in my old 35mm cameras! 
25976 Love the colors 
25977 Good buy. Very happy with this. 
25978 Very sturdy and light weight. Easy to carry around 
25979 The glue was not sticking 
25980 A lot shorter and narrower than I expected 
25981 Great value for the money. Wonderful views of the skies. 
25982 i CANNOT BELIEVE HOW GOOD THE PICTURES ARE COMING OUT FOR A VERY MODERATE PRICE. 
25983 Great case for the price. Camera is a little loose in the case but the case will serve my purpose 
25984 Useful, really water resistant, not so good underwater color photos 
25985 It s good for the money. Wouldn t say it s 720. Also only 30fps, not 60. 
25986 Quickest shopping ever! Best camera ever! 
25987 These clips worked well when attacking the camera to them, but when clipping them to actual mounts (like gopros adhesive mounts, or a chesty) the clips were to tight and impossible to remove without breaking them. 
25988 Great tripod with smart phone mount! Good construction, easy to use, nice storage bag and lens cleaning cloth included. The low price and convenience of front door delivery makes this the deal of the year! I love it! 
25989 Great camera good clarity, never seen software with so many issues. Different results in different browser. Worked only on windows 7 
25990 This is my third case and I m more than happy with them. There is no better way to keep my photo gear protected, perfect for storage and travel, can t go wrong with this case, highly recommended! 
25991 LOVE LOVE LOVE! If you re still doubting, STOP and JUST PURCHASE! You won t regret it! 
25992 It s not exactly what I ve expected but it s ok for other uses. A little to much of a toy instead of a pro kit. 
25993 Works great. 
25994 Love-Love-Love this camera. It makes me feel like a real pro! This package deal was definitely unbeatable. 
25995 Great 
25996 Always buy factory batteries. The other brands are pretty poor. Great quality battery. 
25997 Nice product, quick delivery. This backpack does a great job of storing and protecting my Phantom 3. 
25998 This fit my hero 3+ underwater housing very well. 
25999 I don t really find the gorilla pod useful for my DSLR, it s not able to handle the weight. Note.. make sure your camera supports infrared snapshots unlike me. 
26000 Could be a hair larger, but does job for me...I stuff it with filters, and two to three old med format folders... 
26001 Rarely works. Sometimes I need to click continuously for two minutes until it works 
26002 For an older camera this one fits the bill nicely. great pictures and still has tons of attachments available. 
26003 I was displeased with the photo quality of GoPro cameras, and decided to try out a waterproof camera for snorkeling and shallow dives instead. I couldn t be happier - it takes phenomenal photos above and below water, and I have had no problems with leaking or humidity. 
26004 Son loves his case. 
26005 Great Lens! Beautiful pictures! Not a bad price for an L glass. 
26006 The camera runs down batteries really fast when doing any video. Tried using 2300 mah rechargeables worked a little better but still ran them down quickly 
26007 I am so in love with my new lense. It fits my camera and I can t wait to start shooting! Very excited ! Thank you! 
26008 Love this! Beautiful. Can t wait to get some awesome photos! 
26009 Pretty cheap and flimsy. Will do the job in a pinch, but I would not recommend buying it for a full camera. Maybe if you only wanted to use it for a small digital camera. 
26010 Broke on day 1 when used with a ful bag. Perhaps it s the bags fault (2nd strap to break off of this bag) but its now attached with carabiners. 
26011 tried it out, was as expected. a bit on the heavy, you ll need a good tripod. mine was a bit light. the tripod was great for heavy camera, but tripped over when I attached the Celestron. so now Im buying a tripod, enjoyed the Celestron view 
26012 It served as a replacement unit. 
26013 Works good. had to download 2cu app, but instructions suck. can it be viewed from a computer web browser using windows? No port information in manual. 
26014 Perfect fit for my Gopro hero 4, it is amazing that you don t need to carry your camera to capture the picture or video while your hand busy with other stuffs. I m definitely looking to buy other accessories for my Gopro. 
26015 this is a great kit at a great price...exactly what I was looking for. 
26016 Product was as advertised. 
26017 Depth 
26018 Downside is the screen is very small picture qulity prfect i like it. 
26019 I love that I can check in with my pups anytime. Also love that I get alerts to when there is motion and noise in certian areas. 
26020 Worked well. Held up to the salt water snorkeling and jumping into the water. 
26021 very good batteries. 
26022 Not one of these thing I ever cared to buy but I got tired of loading my ad cards or forgetting them in my pockets and sending them in the laundry. Case works great and is pretty solid. 
26023 Very nice, you can use it as a table cloth, curtain or camo cloth...I just don t use it much i have wall paper that looks similar and i dont need a stand or have to iron it but its good to have 
26024 Stronger material and stitching than I expected. 
26025 Just what I needed for my new camera........ 
26026 Great product. Exactly as described. Thanks. 
26027 The quality is adequate for the price. 
26028 This lenses everything I wanted. Clean and Chrix 
26029 So so so happy with the entire kit especially the camera. Was exactly what I needed and I m having to much fun with it! 
26030 Works well. Very happy with purchase. 
26031 Love the quality of light but wish it was more powerful. The charge is pretty poor too. I paid too much for this item but having said that I do use it regularly..... Just wish I had waited for the new one. 
26032 Good product good quality Very good seller 
26033 Easy to use, fit directly into d7100. The cons I see is that it can easily pop out of place. Good product 
26034 works fine 
26035 eh 
26036 My 17 year old daughter loves the features & smaller size of this camera. Great gift! 
26037 WORKS I THINK BETTER THAN THE GOPRO ONE 
26038 THIS IS MY SECOND ONE-----THE OLD ONE ( 4 YEARS OLD ), STILL WORKS GREAT, BUT I WANTED ANOTHER BEFORE IT BECOMES UNAVAILABLE. I HOOKED BOTH THE RECIEVER AND THE SENDER TO REMOTE X-FORMER SO I DON T NEED TO DEAL WITH REPLACEMENT BATTERIES. 
26039 Works great 
26040 Very easy to hook up brought 2 both took a total of 10 minutes to get working, finding place to plug in Cameras took the longest. Not a bad video image 
26041 Perfect ! 
26042 Grate 
26043 excellent item, very useful for whatever you want, 
26044 Very Good Product 
26045 The moment I plugged the charger + battery in, the circuits were tripped. I don t trust this product. I asked for a refund. 
26046 this POE NVR system is good constructed,nice package,NVR is real 1080P,cameras with nice image and POE function, real plug&play,no need more setting, when my monitor is on with this NVR, all the 4 channels are on also.very nice and price is also very good. 
26047 could be brighter 
26048 It drains the batteries to fast. 
26049 perfect 
26050 Perfect battery for my camera! 
26051 Works great! 
26052 In the ad they said it fit Leoca Q models however it is not 
26053 Great product 
26054 Everything was as I expected and works great. 
26055 Very nice case 
26056 Amazing product!! Very precisely cut glass for that perfect fit!! I was about to buy the screen protector that is much more expensive but I m glad I found this one. It s great value and fully protects my NEX-6 no problem. You won t regret it!! 
26057 Relatively easy to install the software which allows use, and the image generated is of reasonable quality (I am using to confirm authenticity of signatures and vintage documents). I would recommend this product. 
26058 Canon is great 
26059 This is a fabulous budget buy for umbrella s. Setup is minimal, and since they are used mostly indoor, I have no issues with wind, pets, children, etc. If you are just starting out with flash photography, you cannot go wrong with this setup. Highly recommend it. 
26060 good i like it 
26061 but in night view it is not clear 
26062 Hard to install 
26063 This is a nice entry level tripod. The carrying case is a great touch. Perfect for the price! 
26064 It is too small for a regular camera -- probably works best with a smart phone. 
26065 works like a charm. I was having trouble hearing anyone at the door, and often found notes that someone had assumed no one was home. I get a lot of merchandise deliveries, and now know when someone just leaves a package without knocking. 
26066 Needed charger that works car. Works.as.advertised. 
26067 The product is crap. Don t buy it. Waste the $25 some place else.The tripod plate came apart the first time I touched it and is always loose. 
26068 It does the job, but honestly, I got better results as a point-and-shoot from my iPhone 4s. This camera is better for video, so there s that. 
26069 The spare battery and charger will likely never get much use, but it is reassuring to know that I have a spare battery, and the ability to recharge anytime independently of the camera. 
26070 cloths work very well 
26071 I absolutely love it! However, the instructions are entirely in Japanese. Wish me luck! 
26072 Awesome little camera! 
26073 Great product 
26074 excelente producto 
26075 A great variety of accessories for the money, including a solid carrying case. Great purchase for anyone with a GoPro. 
26076 I like it but I must return because I already was given a new system that I can use. 
26077 LOVE it... strong and strudy, durable, fits my 18-135 (with cam), and 50 mm and still have LOT of room with my canon D70 
26078 Very handy lights. I bought several, and I love the feature where you can attach them to one another to make a bigger,brighter light source! 
26079 While my Nikon CLS system will operate a remote flash with the pop up on camera flash in bright sunlight the cable is reliable. Works well and a very good price. 
26080 great product, but missing the camera strap in the packaging 
26081 Great battery arrived on time. 
26082 nothing special just basic low end lens 
26083 Insanely good image quality and bokeh. I was on the fence if I needed an 85mm for portrait work on my DX-format Nikon, but I m so glad I bought this. 
26084 We are happy with the system. 
26085 Fits the camera as expected. Reasonably priced and comfortable. All in all a good replacement for the 7D. I am considering ordering a spare as I live abroad and cannot get these delivered fast. 
26086 Wife loves it. She uses it at work for her evidence. Thanks. 
26087 Great camera! Clear photos and easy to use! 
26088 As advertised. Good quality and shipped quickly. 
26089 great 
26090 I received thisis a very timely manner. It works great! 
26091 After owning this for 3 months I can say the hours of tech support are not worth it. It is unreliable and finicky. If you are an advance tech person then buy it and enjoy your time troubleshooting. 
26092 Good camera for the quality and price. This IP camera is full of features and can become a real toy if you are a good player and try to get into all the functionality. 
26093 Case Logic 
26094 nice 
26095 Wife loves her new gift. Brings those far away shots right up where you want them in a nice clear display. Very nice. 
26096 Thank you 
26097 just have to manually positon this unit to the desire position. the plastic housing feels that it will break if not handle with care 
26098 Fits Mobius with no issues, just like one that came with camera. Bubble level good idea but nice if a bit thinner. 
26099 Great fit!! Perfect length. Not flimsy. Great buy. 
26100 For the price you can t go wrong. Takes a little bit of time to set up as it s universal but for the price it works pretty good. All the reflectors you ll need for any kind of ambient lighting on your outdoor portrait shoot. 
26101 👍👌 
26102 thanks 
26103 Perfect fit. Good feel. Can t even tell it s there. 
26104 Good investment, although be warned, the filters don t really do anything. Save your money for an Orion telescope. 
26105 Terrible product - cheap - couldn t get it off my lens after I installed it! 
26106 I was expecting a little more quality food on the camera (comes out grainy with no flash indoors even when well lit). But for the price this is a good camera. 
26107 This was a purchase for myself and I have found it as advertised and a good purchase. The seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with. 
26108 First carry-on case that s big enough to handle all I want to pack. I especially like the removable insert section that fits even in commuter jet overhead storage. That allows me to carry on the most fragile components, even when the outer shell has to be gate checked. 
26109 Nice at first but fell apart at the plastic joints after a year. pay a little more and get a better quality tripod. 
26110 Arrived quickly and complete. The converter for Europe will come in handy! 
26111 Very good value. A lot of bang for your buck. Very well made. Images are very clear. 
26112 I love the way it look and small enough to carry around 
26113 Great product. Fits just right, protects the screen and you don t even know it s there. 
26114 was ok just smaller than we imagined. It was true to advertisement. 
26115 it was ok 
26116 It had light leaks though 
26117 I have a lot of wrist issues and this really helps with support. I don t worry about dropping my camera now! Shoot with a Nikon D600 
26118 as expected 
26119 Inexpensive, fits well and secure, gives you some room for grip. It clears the battery trap but because of the extra 1/2 inch, you ll need to pinch the battery out. 
26120 Very happy with these lights. Powerful, they display the color temp in Kelvin, they don t get hot, and they can run off batteries. Excellent. 
26121 I use it at the shooting range and it holds pretty steady. The focal length adjuster is a little too tight for my liking but this monocle does it s job pretty well. I can easily see my shots at 25 yards. 
26122 Sorry not good, returned item 
26123 This works beautifully for supplementing natural light with more natural light. It is large and very efficient. 
26124 I bought the kit to use with my new GoPro on a trip to Florida and was very happy with performance and the quality of the items in the kit. It was a great alternative to the higher price accessories I am completely happy with kit and with the seller. 
26125 It fits g7x screen perfectly. 
26126 great buy 
26127 Good 
26128 Its great camera float to the top, Very pleased with it 
26129 Cute throw at least that is the purpose I used it for and this does the job. I put it on the back of my daughter s mod chair and she loves it. 
26130 The camera is wonderful and the company is amazing! 
26131 Exactly what I was looking for. 
26132 adequate 
26133 It works OK. 
26134 Lasts longer than generic 
26135 Bought for a friend and he likes it. 
26136 Great value, better than my expectations. These last as long as the originals. 
26137 Great quality and Great Price. 
26138 excelente 
26139 Show 
26140 Very lightweight and easy to grip. Just what I needed. 
26141 Great camera 
26142 The product met expectations. 
26143 Love the driveway alert doorbell, we actually use it for our apartment to know when someone is coming down our steps because we live in the rear of the building. 
26144 Can t tell yet. Camera arrived defective and had to be returned. 
26145 not easy to operate 
26146 This helps when I m playing paintball so I don t have a shiny camera on my helmet 
26147 Very heavy, clumsy. A sturdy base/light stand is needed--not a folding stand. 
26148 A great inexpensive filter. 
26149 Typical DJI quality. 
26150 Great product. Fits like a glove - almost too tight. Definitely protects the camera. Just a little work to get the camera in and out. 
26151 Fast shipping, great price! 
26152 It fits in very nicely with my new Hero 4 Silver. 
26153 Daughter loves it and takes her selfie stick everywhere. Everybody comments on how pretty the crystals are. Came fast and was a pleasure to buy from this seller. 
26154 If you want HD quality, don t get this. Sound wasn t great. Bought for a wedding and then a rock show, and was not impressed. Returning ASAP. 
26155 Pole grip moves and ended up ripping after about 6 months of use. GoPro s are suppose to withstand a any type of activity and weather and this did not. 
26156 It was what I expected. 
26157 Received in good time however the screen contrast is poor and quality not great. Price was good though so at least I can see the controls again! 
26158 Nice - works well - foam insert just a hair too small so it comes out easily. 
26159 Good stuff!! Quality aftermarket product. Pretty happy with my purchase. 
26160 good product. The format is AVI and doesn t work with I-Mac s unless you download a third party program that reads the AVI format 
26161 Good 
26162 great camera. read the instriuctions 
26163 heavy 
26164 Extremely bad picture quality. Not sure if it is just this particular camera but its pretty bad. I ll send it back 
26165 Only used this once. No start up instructions, finally figured it out. 
26166 Really like the clarity and features of the image and frame. Would recommend this brand to anyone! 
26167 Good as the OEM. No complaints. 
26168 Took this camera with me on recent trip. Great videos and photos. Easy to use. 
26169 batteries discharge VERY rapidly!! Nowhere as good as my orginal Sony batteries. 
26170 As described. Fast shipping. 
26171 Love it - use it everyday to monitor activities of my pets. 
26172 Excellent fit! No messing around with loose fitting connectors. 
26173 I fell in love with the quality and all of the tiny pockets. Such an awesome bag!!!!!! 
26174 I bought it to offer some protection for the lens on a Sony HDR-CX430V video camera. It s wide angle so the hood never shows in my video, which was a concern. 
26175 Thank you! 
26176 It is so cute and so well made. I love it! 
26177 This does not fit the a6000 properly. It is missing a lip at the front end to slide in, which causes it to protrude from the back. 
26178 love the product it fitted my xa20... 
26179 Ordered this for a friend after they saw the one I bought earlier for my home. Easy to setup and use. 
26180 Looks good but could not find 8gb sd card at all 
26181 Didn t sink that s forsure! thanks! haha 
26182 Camera is quite realistic. 
26183 Works great. Plug & play like an original cable release 
26184 The Canon brand batteries seem to last longer than the cheap copies. The only reason I didn t give it five stars is because of the price. 
26185 Nice case at a great price. Genuine Samsung product. 
26186 Cane right on tiem for my trip with my new waterproof camera ! I was concerned the thin string would pop and it didnt n it went through alot lol. Thanks again. 
26187 Used the mount on my mountain bike. After a few uses the tightening screw cracked. 
26188 Great product and super shipping. Thanks so much. 
26189 didn t work with my Alpha 77 / Alpha 65 camera i dont know what s wrong , maybe it s defective or maybe it s a battery issue , i have no idea 
26190 that wasn t working 
26191 Works great and the price was less than what we found locally 
26192 Does not have the extended end tabs that help you align it perfectly before touching it down. I missed badly when trying to position it. Wound up throwing it away. 
26193 Well made nice padding 
26194 A great upgrade to the f/1.8 version 
26195 Very Manual - It s fun to play around with, but I feel like you have to use a tripod because any movement you make will cause blur. It s very manual, but fun if you are just killing time and taking photos of birds. 
26196 Fine product, great service. 
26197 This came with zero information or instructions on how to use. I m trying to decide if I want to send it back. 
26198 Great kit! Fast shipping! And you can t beat the price! Nothing has broken yet! :) 
26199 Fast delivery and product is exactly as advertised. 
26200 I expected much better quality photos with 20.1 MP resolution. It could be that I relied too much on the &#34;Intelligent Auto Mode&#34;. Unfortunately my pictures turned out grainy and out of focus even when I used a prop to hold the camera still when shooting. 
26201 Works as advertised. Nice to get everything together, especially one charging block that can be plugged into the car charger or into a 110V outlet. 
26202 This was a purchase for myself and I have found it as advertised and a good purchase. The seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with. 
26203 Excellent 
26204 Great we love it! 
26205 Good,but not reliable,it works but not what I was expected 
26206 Great value. Good for someone without smartphone or tablet. 
26207 It s cool camera and amazing performance! I could take beautiful pictures and movies 25m depth under water. 
26208 Overall the product is very good for the price. I would definitely recommend this alarm. 
26209 Works fine. But the black len will be in the picture. 
26210 As advertised 
26211 Great camera for the price. Im using it more than my 18-55mm. 
26212 As advertised! Not a lot of experienced yet as how will it behave, but looks great and charged well so far. 
26213 No issues. 
26214 I was very happy with my X1 UV MRC4 77mm that I bought 67mm for another lens. 
26215 Great product. Extremely satisfied with it for the price. 
26216 Just what we needed when our other battery kept dying on vacay. Now we ll have a spare fully charged. 
26217 Too Much Stuff and not enough time to use it. 
26218 I got 2 of these for my girl and myself. They both worked great we had no issues. Thanks for the product! 
26219 Worked great until..... The ring that holds the lens in one of the pieces (macro) fell out, thus allowing the lens to come out of the mount :( 
26220 Exactly what I was looking for to replace my original Olympus C7AU that I lost in a move. Works perfectly. Great for when the camera is on a tripod because the battery compartment gets covered by the tripod attachment, which makes it annoying when batteries need changing. 
26221 We are using this as a baby monitor and it has been great. Only problem is that it used to send me notifications of movement, but it doesn t anymore, and I can t figure out why...but I still love it! 
26222 Sick case 
26223 Great product, thank you. 
26224 An inexpensive way to soften off-camera strobe. Does what it s supposed to do. Appears to be made well, especially for the price. 
26225 The mouth mount from Ho Stevie is an extremely comfortable mount!!! It is great for surfing. I would recommend this product to anyone that enjoys hands free videoing!!! 
26226 Works perfectly with my Canon EOS Rebel T3i, was easy to set up, and it s very easy to use. No complaints at all for this product, it s a pretty straightforward wireless remote control. I use it to start and stop recording for video wireless and it works great! 
26227 Items came in a good package. All items fit my Gopro very well. I will be buying another one with for the touch bacpac in the future 
26228 Just as described. I use this for shooting over babies as to not lose my grip. 
26229 I will keep this as a spare. 
26230 I love this case. It keeps anything smelly (cigars and the like) from stinking up my purse. I spray painted the lid white before using it so the contents wouldn t be easily visible. 
26231 I use them for the lake and football games. They are a excellent value a little long but they are manageable without the use of a tripod. Wish I had bought these sooner 
26232 Quick shipment and good value! 
26233 Cool price. It s republished but good work. I can access easily by internet & my smart phone. 
26234 Fits on the Nikon 7100d camera 
26235 Stopped working after 3 months. 
26236 fits perfect, very easy to use. I plan to purchase one for every lens I have. 
26237 Speedy delivery, chest strap holds camera in place when shooting video on motorcycle. Happy with product. 
26238 received the pen in only 2 days. looks very simple to use. charging now and going to use it right away. does not look cheaply made. and the pen even writes. 
26239 This was a present for my wife to replace the Cannon she has had for many years. She loves it and the great pictures she takes. 
26240 As its suppose to, it fits my lens. John 
26241 Only work once 
26242 Perfect love it 
26243 It scraped by lens body, leaving a permanent mark of scratch. 
26244 Just what i needed an extra charging cord. 
26245 Great surveillance system. Cheap but does the job perfectly. 
26246 It s well made and my service dog enjoys it 
26247 It is 1600mAh vs 1060 in the original battery, but the original battery is heavier and lasts longer. 
26248 Thanks, it was on time delivery and the pro woks well 
26249 the top part of the tripod where the go pro screws on broke off the first time i used it. the plastic just stright up broke. if it hadn t borken so easily the concept of the wraparound legs is great. 
26250 Fits camera great. No room for nothing else. 
26251 good color with light, good night vision with IR enabled. Never thought my families are so closer with me and it 
26252 hard to get on the computer 
26253 Hoya makes good filters for reasonable prices. This one is great for making longer exposures of outdoor subjects such as waterfalls. 
26254 Was an outstanding birthday gift at a fraction of the price you would find at a big box retailer store such as best buy 
26255 A little small 
26256 Just what I needed great 
26257 Awesome little bag especially for use around the house and short trips with cannon camera 
26258 good product 
26259 everything works great except WI-FI, luckily at my business it was easy to connect to modem by cable, which works better with no pause for movement,need better instructions and problem solving, still worth it. 
26260 Very crappy material. Won t last long. Poor Poor quality! It s also very light and the slightest bit of wind will have it down the street. 
26261 Perfect for football season. I m going to pick up some extras. 
26262 Works grest 
26263 Great price on this great lens for getting that long shot of birds. Plus the super fast next day delivery was amazing. Thanks big mikes great service and products. I m sure I will buy more products from you. 
26264 Excellent product!!! 
26265 This camera is great. Telephoto shots are amazing. Love everything about this camera and cannot beat the great price! It is everything I need for London. You need the extra battery. 
26266 Used this with my Action Cam 200 and was very impressed with it. Very versatile as well. 
26267 This Camera was a used replacement for an identical camera I already had and it is great. My favorite when it comes to picture taking, so much so that I will be ordering another before this one wears out like my old one did. 
26268 They work, but it took a buncha effort to make the lighting and everything work, and even after that I needed to Photoshop it. 
26269 Works just fine. No frills, just does exactly what it says on the tin. 
26270 as a battery grip its great. but after 1 month the connection port for the grips shutter button broke. 
26271 I love this selfie stick good quality pretty sturdy 
26272 My favorite camera bag thus far. IT has plenty of space for my sony alpha 600 and go pro 4 gear. It is stylish and rugged. I am extremely happy with this purchase :) 
26273 decent but not great 
26274 I love this camera, works great for business and personal use 
26275 Does the trick for the price. Bottom plastic pieces are weak. 
26276 Arrived ahead of schedule. Great price. Works well. 
26277 Piece of crap 
26278 Excellent cameras and buyer was also available for a question. 
26279 Fit exact to AW130 givin aditional scratch protection and a waterproof toy look 
26280 Cameras need a small magnet and if u lose it and the camera loses power u have no way to reset the camera leaving it worthless wouldn t recommend this product 
26281 Just one word...Excellent!!! 
26282 Excelent 
26283 I though can be pair with any smart phones,android including Nokia Lumia that s why I bought it. But won t be able to used it the Bluetooth doesn t work with my phone otherwise have to used the timer. Little bit Disappointed! 
26284 The item was better than i expected. The fact that it had 50mm objective lens, the &#34;resolution&#34; is awesome! Easier to work with than binoculars i.e focusing on the object, looking through the eye piece, etc. definitely recommend! 
26285 It seems OK, I have not as yet used it myself, but my son said it seems OK 
26286 Amazing 
26287 i was expecting at least the cd driver for it 
26288 Functions exactly as intended 
26289 excellent service and product 
26290 Over all so so product. You get what you pay for. For this price it is a good bag for normal rough usage. Plenty of pockets and space. I dont like the strap but you can always attach a better one. It arrived on time actually same day. 
26291 I love the flexibility. It s better than the tripods that don t bend. 
26292 great transaction. Product as described 
26293 It is incredible, also amazon has packed me very well the lens, in an excellent State lleog and besides having excellent optics lens. 
26294 Honestly, I wasn t expecting much. But the picture quality is not good. I am very disappointed. Battery life is horrible. Slow to respond. Flash has to charge and it takes a few seconds. Just all around not much bang for your buck. 
26295 Lov 
26296 Great value. Individually wrapped for convenience. 
26297 Meets all my expectations for my digital images!!! 
26298 Very good 
26299 Came as advertised. Sharp focus and easy to handle. 
26300 good for bikes but wont fit on bigger pipes, railings 
26301 Love Moose Peterson s polarizer - works & warms as it s supposed to- hoya has been around forever 
26302 Yet to use this bag but my Canon SX-520 and accessories fit in well. 
26303 It s great to have backup batteries for the camera. 
26304 They work great and they are a fantastic price. 
26305 Worked like a charm! 
26306 Finally got a deal on it. I had a 102 before and loved it. Gave it to my in law and get this one. It is big for sure. But same high quality as 102. 
26307 5 star, bigger than advertised- it is 9.5 x 6.5 x 3 inches- well padded, and easily holds my canon SX110 Is camera and a charger. 
26308 Just as described, on time delivery= happy customer! 
26309 I absolutely love this camera! It takes beautiful pictures. 
26310 Bought this for my husbands birthday. He loves it. Light. Easy to carry. Stable. 
26311 works great 
26312 I love this lens! Thanks so very much! 
26313 plastic feels okay not the best 
26314 Be nice if this actually fit. P3 s need a lot of cutting. Still does not fit correctly. Phantom sits way to high which is now prone to damage and controller does not fit. Not impresses. 
26315 False advertising as it said 1000tvl on the description. Never buy anything under 1000tvl! Huge picture difference from my experience. 
26316 Very nice lens for my Nikon Dd3100 
26317 Works great 
26318 The product is way more then I expected. 
26319 Fit very nicely and did what it was suppose to do. For the price, I def recommend this product! 
26320 SUCKS Sucks sucks sucks Don t waste your money. Can t even get it to work!!! Waste of time! 
26321 Shipping great. Perfect gift 
26322 Left our charger at home on our trip. Was able to order this and get it shipped to where we were staying. Werks perfets and was just what we needed with great shipping. 
26323 Did not meet expectation and returned for a refund 
26324 Very Good product , not bad at all , the hand grip is very short , that s the only down side for me thus far , it s not suited for huge Cameras , of course , other than that , works very Good for me :) 
26325 slow in charging. My Nikon chargers are twice as fast. With the power supply I still have two pieces except with this charger only one plug is needed 
26326 Bought this on a whim. There are many products. Would advise getting something which gives more control over white balance. The filters are not ideal The color tones on face is variable. Price is okay. 
26327 Item failed to work properly! 
26328 It mounts the nvd on the head. No need to give it the hose again. 
26329 I did devolution of this product... 
26330 Very nice. 
26331 I researched many types of home security solutions and Canary ended up being my choice. I m happy with what I ve received for my investment. 
26332 I love this camera!! Underwater and not even in water it gives really good HD quality. I really enjoy using it on all the adventures I have with my family! 
26333 I added an electronic dead bolt to my alarm system. This key fob turns off the alarm and unlocks my front door. Very handy when coming home with an arm load of grocery etc. 
26334 Worked as hoped for. Prompt delivery. Good price. Thanks a million. 
26335 I m very pleased with my product. I traveled for 15 days and not failed. I m very happy with my Selfie Bluetooth Shutter Wireless Remote Control. Thanks Noot. 
26336 Easy to install and the iPhone app is Fantastic. Been very happy for the last two months. 
26337 Little on the heavy side But good camera 
26338 So I ve been walking with this every morning and it makes me feel a bit safer. It s small enough I can hold it in my hand and love the chain I can wear on my neck when needed. Hopefully I will never have to use it! 
26339 works great. 
26340 No complaints with the product. FYI - it does not come with a memory card, you have to purchase one separately. I wish I had know ahead of time since this was a gift, and I could have purchased one at the same time of my original order. 
26341 I take it to water parks and rivers. It s taken a beating yet looks great and functions as expected. 
26342 Love this bag. It fit my camera perfectly, I love how it has so many different compartments and pockets to store all the accessories or gadgets I want to bring along with me. 
26343 Great way to go OTA and still be able to record favorite programs etc. 
26344 So far works for my needs. The apps need improvement. Four stars is due to long wait time for customer support 20min to an hour on average. Danny was very helpful in assisting me with the product set up. 
26345 good and cute camera. Very good quality photos, and pretty easy to use 
26346 This battery works like a charm. My first impressions were that it had a nice fit, very good power capacity, and works exactly like the OEM. I can t really tell the difference between this and my Canon battery. Good buy for a budget professional! 
26347 Works well and we used it underwater with no problem. 
26348 Poor quality. Not worth the money. 
26349 Camera works well.. in and out of the water. Was very pleased with this item 
26350 works very well with our GoPro Hero2 
26351 Fantastic, works great 
26352 it s alright 
26353 Very good 
26354 I ve been looking for this waterprrof action cam. This is very great! 
26355 Excellent product delivered on time. 
26356 It doesn t fit what it says it fits very clearly, did not fit my lenses and according to the info, it should have fit them. 
26357 Does the job 
26358 Ok little setup grief. Quality decent. Worth the $$$$ 
26359 The attachment strap unraveled after two uses. Don t count on it as a sole means of attaching anything to your wrist. 
26360 Smaller than I anticipated but I like that it can fold up easily for my camera bag. I was a little surprised it said that it expires in two years seeing as it costs a lot for a small item. I look forward to using it. 
26361 Quaity product as expected. 
26362 It does the job well. 
26363 My wife needed the hoods and lens cover, this kit provided all and more! Timely shipping, too. Thanks! 
26364 Love the props! 
26365 Cut and dry it s a great case, and is well made..does the job nicely... 
26366 Good so far for the price! 
26367 Great product, great value 
26368 Just ok but nothing great. Fisheye can be better. 
26369 These batteries seem to last slightly longer than the stock battery that came with my gopro hero 4. 
26370 I do a lot of kayak fishing and this works perfectly to keep my gopro safe and in view if I ever lose it. Definitely helps ease the mind in case I m clumsy or if it takes a dive. 
26371 This won t completely get rid of wind noise, but it will cut down on it considerably. 
26372 Works great. Love having the extra power. 
26373 DOA 
26374 Functional but wish there is a LCD screen to see what is being recorded. 
26375 It fits the camera and is basically like putting sunglasses on your lens. 
26376 Paired easily with SmartThings and works great. My only problem is you can t control the timeout reset. It s default is 4 minutes to reset as other reviewers have stated. You can change the jumpers to test mode and this allows it to reset as soon as motion stops. 
26377 It is not Hero but ;-))) 
26378 Great 
26379 Amazing manual focus wide angle. Super sharp and great color rendition. I use it on my D810 for long exposures. Would definitely recommend it if you don t need the autofocus. 
26380 User manual was the size of a stamp. Too much complicated for the user. 
26381 The bar looks great and sturdy with rollers inside to glide and slide. Unfortunately, it came today with a broken screw necessary for adjusting the tension for sliding. Pretty much an important piece... 
26382 Great price, very fast shipping. 
26383 What s not to like? A solid performer at a great price, you can t go wrong. 
26384 Received a Chinese PAL version of this camera, yeah, like THAT should even be sold to a US customer... Contacted Dahua support for assistance, they told me to go to the supplier for firmware.. First and last Dahua product I ll buy... 
26385 Works just as described, great option to buying OEM 
26386 This pair of binoculars performed adequately but the family much preferred the Pentax Marine Boat 8 x 25. The strap never functioned properly. 
26387 no as good as they said the wood be 
26388 This is my second DLink. And EVEN BETTER than the last one. I love the tilt and pan features. I highly recommend. But remember- if you are on a VPN from your company- turn it off to set this up. Speeds up the process! 
26389 they work 
26390 Works as described. The pinhole gives a very narrow view for playback. While recording one of the lights continues to flash, no car remote does that and its something that will bring attention to your undercover work. Putting your finger over it works 
26391 excellent quality and size, perfect for mirrorless camera! Looks so cute too. 
26392 My son asked for this along with a gorilla pod for Christmas for his Fuji camera and he loved it. 
26393 legs are no as stable.. ok for the cost range 
26394 Nice camera! 
26395 Awesome Flash at such a budget price. Features and controls are easy to access and ETTL worked just fine. 
26396 Film took too long to expose and pictures were not as clear as compared to old pack of real Polaroid Film. Would not buy again 
26397 If you need the size, you can t beat this case. Expensive, but well worth it when needing to protect something. 
26398 Great batteries, hopefully I wont need them anytime soon. These will be backups for one of my rifle optics. 
26399 Excellent quality and price point compared to other similar multi-mounts bars. The two end threads are 3/8&#34; only and not interchangeable, so just be aware. The two TOP threads are 1/4&#34; and 3/8&#34; interchangeable. 
26400 Fulfills all of my FPV needs. Highly recommend a Shade also... 
26401 Purchased for my wife as an extra safety when she has to walk to her car in the dark after she gets off work. A quick test showed it is good and loud - and will be one more thing to make here feel safer. 
26402 it doesn t show battery amount in a flip 
26403 Pack is amazing, Camera it self a good gadget 
26404 It s very roomy and versatile. 
26405 Ridiculously easy to set up. Everything works. I love it. 
26406 Good in all sense. 
26407 Very satisfied with the quality of the camera and zoom 
26408 Works well as expected! 
26409 Only sharp with ideal lighting. Other wise not so sharp. Save your money and buy a carl zeiss or l lens or 50mm f1.4 by canon. 
26410 Disappointed with the video quality but for the money what would you expect? It has now become my dash cam. 
26411 There is a lot of confusion regarding which props should be used on a P3. This listing, the information and shipping speed made all the problems go away. Just what I needed with a minimum of hassles. 
26412 Lot of softbox for the money...why complain about anything with value like this...I use a manfrotto umbrella adaptor to attach it with led panel...led sits up high but it works...the diffusion is fairly strong, but it s soft--clean light 
26413 This camera is perfect for capturing memories in picture and video form. We love it! 
26414 Very satisfied! Product as described! Charged my Nikon P330 camera battery completely. No complaints. 
26415 Great buy and it works very well. Recommend this product. 
26416 Worked great with my Foscam indoor to angle it out a window. 
26417 I mean... I THINK I ll love it as much as my mindshift 180 back-pack.... I m just waiting for some rain to test it out!? 
26418 This is my second pair.. bought them for my wife..excellent binoculars! 
26419 Perfect with the Celestron Skymaster 25X70 
26420 Great product Will be purchasing this again 
26421 works ok, it s a battery 
26422 Great bag. Have had it for years and it hardly shows any wear. Very versatile. 
26423 Outstanding image quality, excellent low light capabilities producing minimum noise, compact but powerful. Incorporates many features normally found in mid to high level DSLRs, three video formats producing high quality 1080 HD video. However, due in large part to the camera s extensive functionality, it is somewhat complex and complicated. 
26424 Great product and less cost than Nikon. 
26425 This works well. 
26426 Great 
26427 worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks. 
26428 Not sturdy. Just OK for a very light camera! 
26429 Worked great for about a month until it randomly broke. Very upset about this product. It would have been a great product had it actually been reliable and not easily breakable. 
26430 Perfect 
26431 Great Kit, lots of extra items that I don t have to purchase separately. 
26432 I love the camera Lafavre camera in the world 
26433 SD Memory card slot not working had to send it back. Got a new one that worked 
26434 Eccellent 
26435 Great Product 
26436 Excellent use on motorcycle. Good quality already dropped them and it didn t even phase them and the recording ability...tough and durable 
26437 Extremely poor quality, Lens covered with scratches, would not recommend. 
26438 Works good 
26439 Works 
26440 This is a neat little gadget - surprisingly effective and dirt simple to use. A lot of bang for the buck. Should be fun for you kids or grandkids, but also useful for an adult as well. Provides detail well beyond that visible with a magnifying glass. 
26441 I find that is diffuses the flash more than it softens it. for the price it is great, but does not produce soft box quality 
26442 VERY Nice Product and Shipped even Faster that Promised! Thank you! Its a Plus that this cable has fittings attached..Great Quality Product! 
26443 Creates a great curve for close objects but back up a few steps and you just get the world around your subject.. 
26444 nice priced small camera 
26445 Clear pictures and great value. Night vision mode reflects the IR light off the window pane and washes out the picture. I m sure there is a solution to remedy this issue, but haven t had the time to look. 
26446 Super fun! Take it every where! 
26447 great light 
26448 I get compliments on this case all the time. I m glad I purchased it. It looks so classy. 
26449 Fantastic case. Fits the camera perfectly and very nicely made. I highly recommend it!! 
26450 Less expensive allowed me to buy two for the price of one gopro battery. 
26451 Not sure if it s a knock off, came in a package labeled gopro, took about 5 min to change and it s like the damage never happened 
26452 as described, no issues 
26453 The camera not only has the good quality,but also offer the best services,besides the price of the product is reasonable. 
26454 This little camera is so much fun and my daughter has absolutely loved using it. It takes decent pictures, is quick, and easy to operate. Lots of fun to have with this! 
26455 Great product. Easy to insert and takes great photo s! 
26456 Perfect for use 
26457 This does not work with my T3i, they said that T3i and 600D are the same... this is not correct. this does not turn on my camera with the batteries or even the Li-po batteries 
26458 Very pleased. Great price, quick shipping. 
26459 Is exactly what I need. It fits perfectly on my fuji x-t1. Highly recommend it to fuji x-t1 owner. Great product! 
26460 Works great, now my youngest son thinks it s his camera and gets greatly offended when we try to take it back. Bobber does exactly as intended, let the big kids go down slides holding it and taking fun videos and don t have to worry about the camera disappearing. 
26461 It didn t work so i returned it. refund was back on card before it even made it back to rma site. Thank you 
26462 Golf product 
26463 Very good,I likes it..... 
26464 A total Waste of $money$ for anyone who cares to not get ripped off. They are playing with your imagination by marketing this product as worth the savings. Flat out lies. Cant say you weren t warned here first. Good Luck 
26465 All of the accessories are great. I tried all of them on the day the camera was received. Great! 
26466 Great mirrorless digital canera 
26467 works good 
26468 we use these in our beach condo. perfect for dolphin watching 
26469 This tripod is exactly what I wanted. The legs can be moved but securely hold their position. Besides that, it is very stylish looking:) 
26470 Works great 
26471 nice, even have a you-tube video to tell you how to use it 
26472 Does not fit pictinnay rail as it should but nothing a few zip ties couldn t fix. 
26473 THESE ARE REAL CHEEP , BATTERY SWITCH DOES NOT WORK , THEY DO LOOK REAL 
26474 I carry it with me as a spare in case the one I usually use meets with misfortune. It has a lot of useful features. 
26475 Quality is good and quick delivery. 
26476 It s a nice little protector of the elements. 
26477 Just as described. Received very timely. 
26478 Great strap. Very happy with this purchase. Now I can wear my camera across my body, so my neck does not get sore. 
26479 I received this device free-of-charge for the purpose of testing and publishing this review (Netgear s Friends and Family program). It s a beautiful product and very easy to setup and config. I like it! 
26480 Bought the camera and it seems like its well made. Called customer service; they are a joke. 44 minutes on hold. overseas &quot;specialist&quot; had the nerve to tell me that it was past their closing time and told me to call back tomorrow. Unbelievable. Their customer service is a joke....... 
26481 Excellent both in value and quick delivery. The six pack is perfect for purse and traveling. I use for my readers, IPad, IPhone and flat screen TV s. Washable as well with just water. 
26482 Quality is Meh, but it works well. This particular one is extremely difficult to attach to the pelican lid, as your screwdriver must reach the screw THROUGH the mesh pockets. If that sounds dumb, it is. I wouldn t have a pelican without this, but the design is lacking. 
26483 Ready to use straight from the box 
26484 Photos and description of the product led me to believe this timer had connectors for multiple camera types. It does not. The pictures show an interchangeable connector. The model I received does not. It will only work with one of my cameras. Very disappointed! 
26485 The tripod holds my Nikon camera pretty well. It s not as sturdy as I imagined it would be but if you re on a budget it ll do the job! 
26486 Seems to be of very high quality and screwed into my 18-135mm Canon lens without fuss. Clarity is perfect, and, protects the front lens as well as reducing UV light. 
26487 I couldn t get them to work. 
26488 Great price!!! 
26489 Excellent product 
26490 Cheap in price and in quality. The cameras did not last even a year. It is better to pay a bit more and get a quality product. SHould have known when the warranty is only for 3 months. 
26491 is so nice... good quality 
26492 Really nice camera for the price. I did not need the WiFi feature of the GoPro so this was a great alternative. 
26493 Good fit and made especially for my lens 
26494 Very good! 
26495 Good Deal! 
26496 These brackets are poorly made! The swivel mechanism does not hold the camera securely in place. Therefore the camera will just hang loosely! Save your money and buy better quality brackets from Netgear! 
26497 Use it to mount 80X spotting scope at the shooting range. Very stable with sturdy legs. Would recommend for spotting scopes and cameras. Well built tripod. 
26498 All I can say that this is the best filter case I have ever came across....It s padded well, and made well....I highly recommend this case to everyone... 
26499 Great! I use this often, it comes in handy when I need to bring only some of my equipment. 
26500 Henry assisted me in installing my app for foscam,the cameras are easy to set up and customer service was great. 
26501 Excellent higher quality selfie-stick - it s worth paying a few extra dollars. It clamps your cell phone firmly in place and is fully adjustable for length, camera angle, etc. I have only used it with my phone but it also has an attachment to secure a digital camera. 
26502 Great for Mid Size Camera and Enough storage Great Protection Just What I needed 
26503 Bien 
26504 I m still a novice, so I don t really know what this is used for. The product is ok, but, I ordered the wrong size. 
26505 I have used this so far in my pool. and it works fine 
26506 Has a nive grip on on it , that doesn t hold water .. Feels like this will hold up for a long time 
26507 I love them! 
26508 So far they are working good. Holds a charge well 
26509 Glass was warped so it wouldn t seal about 3/4&#34; edge on one side. 
26510 This little camera fits in a shirt pocket so it is easy to take on a hike in the woods or anywhere else. 
26511 This case works great. It has pockets and compartments useful for all my gear. it even came with a cleaning cloth. 
26512 Customer service is great, and the product really sucks (to the thing you want it to.) Comes with a tether too for piece of mind for all those times you mount it to a moving vehicle (the entire reason I bought it) 
26513 The only Camara I have ever bought, over 20, that didn t come with a lense cap?!? Camera does NOT shoot RAW even though the listing says it does. 
26514 The tripod is flimsy, and the bag has an ugly logo affixed to it. But for the price I got what I paid for; the little SD card transfer thingie is definitely nice to have. 
26515 Fujifilm manufactured battery that is identical in appearance to the one supplied with the camera. Expensive (as are all OEM batteries) but expect it to last the course unlike a lot of the third party cheaper substitutes. 
26516 Very good 
26517 Came quickly and appear to be good quality. Will see as I use them 
26518 Good optics but heavy to hold long and hard to hold steady enough to prevent visual blurring. Should stick with the seven power. 
26519 These are just handy to have 
26520 Easy to use. Can attach to stands or hand hold. 
26521 resolution has alittle to be desired but functioned as descibed 
26522 A great bag to protect our Canon, with extra pockets for misc. 
26523 Perfect product! Nice price! Fast delivery! 
26524 Sturdy and works as advertised. Definitely not something to get though if you re looking for portability. 
26525 prefect size for a work desk! 
26526 The idea for this product is great, but the rotating peg comes off its base pretty easily. 
26527 I love the case. It came on time and it is perfect for my Fuji mini 8 camera! 
26528 working well as expected for 960h 
26529 Bought this item TWICE. First time one of the light fixtures would not work. Second time, was shorted the 2nd LED light bulb. Purchased to take pictures of product to sell online. Workspace is a little small, but takes up a LOT of room to set up. 
26530 Great product, great price and delivered on time. What is not to like. Highly recommended. This got here before the camera so I had the batteries all charged up ready for my camera which arrived the next day. 
26531 as described 
26532 Quality is good. It is tough to steam the wrinkles out of the fabric, but when used with good lighting and wrinkle free chromakey works perfectly. 
26533 Great product for the pric 
26534 Ipurchased this camera for my 10 yr old daughter and she absolutely loves it. It takes good quality pictures and is easy to use. 
26535 Love this lens! 
26536 Outstanding!! 
26537 I love that little camera. It is amazing, and would ve been so at twice the price! 
26538 The boom is great, the clamp is great, the height of the stand sucks if I plan to use it to hold my hair light. It just doesn t go high enough. Until I find a taller stand, I m relegating this setup to who knows what. 
26539 Excelente. 
26540 Doesn t record when plugged in. It only recorded in 20-minute segments and the battery doesn t past long even after it has been fully charged. Don t waste your time and money on this. 
26541 Great!! 
26542 awesome slider, would ve gotten the full 5 stars if it was able to mount up to a tripod. but for this price you cant beat it! awesome for the type of shooting that i m doing which is car meets! 
26543 Not bad but not that good.... =) 
26544 very difficult to be used. I bought it for my father and he dosn t use it at all, because is very tricky. I will I can return. Not a good product. 
26545 I love this camera, I had it for a few months now and I keep discovering new things. The pictures this takes are beautiful! This is my first DSLR and I couldn t be more pleased. 
26546 It s a Canon. 
26547 Very good baby cam/security cam! Setup is a breeze, and picture quality is awesome 
26548 Super tough strength holding my cabinet in place. Easy to install but remember the two white wires coming from the front of the unit are not needed unless you are using an alarm system and want to be notified when the door is open. 
26549 works great 
26550 This is for Canon new FD mount. Old Canon mount with breech lock can mount, but it cannot lock properly. As a result, the aperture control does not work for breech lock lenses. 
26551 Does the job. Package arrived quickly. 
26552 works as expected. The chromium finish fades/scratches after some use though. 
26553 Bought this to use as decor for a friend s apartment (she s a film student) For anyone using it for actual productions, you ll probably have to superglue the magnets on the inside of the clapper, mine came falling out. 
26554 This product does not work with nikon d3300. After I plugged it into the camera, the camera will not power up. I checked the nikon battery EN-EL14a states 7.2 V, 1230mAh. This charger states 9V, 5A. You have been warned. 
26555 Excellent product. A must for anyone who owns a BMPCC! 
26556 Works great!!!! 
26557 Great feeling grip, batteries do their thing...but after a few days of shooting, the shutter button on the grip stopped working. It will work half-shutter, but not full. Will have to return for a fix... UPDATE: I just slapped it, and it started working again 
26558 great system 
26559 Fits perfect no problems at all. 
26560 Great product and arrived on time 
26561 Loved it and would recommend it. 
26562 Cheap and not at all like the photo. Looks like a sheet that someone tried to clean a paintbrush on with blue paint on it. Sucks, 
26563 This item arrived exactly as it was suppose to ! The lenses are great! Takes creativity to a new level ! 
26564 Thanks for the items, very fast delivery. 
26565 So hard to find 35MM film now, however, I still appreciate the quality of film. Digital is great, but I believe there is still a place for film - particularly with fine art. 
26566 I did not like we can use to many problem with installation 
26567 I think it is excellent for the price. Not super duty but will get the job done. For balance it is best to align the lights with one of the legs. I plan to lengthen the legs 5 or 6 inches with 1/2 inch aluminum rod for better stability. 
26568 The two batteries simply doesn t work! My Lumix 5 doesn t recognise it. Charger is fine. 
26569 Very Good. 
26570 never worked! 
26571 Makes everyone look beautiful 
26572 what do you say about batteries and a charger other than they work? 
26573 it s ok 
26574 Film was great! 
26575 USELESS! 
26576 So far its decent. No leaks. The remote function (connect to phone app) doesnt work. Color is lacking. But not bad for the price. 
26577 Nice case and set up for camera. Its a bit pricey is why I only have it 4 stars 
26578 Been in use for years with 0 issues whatsoever. Even beating the hell out of it on ATVs, swimming at the beach with it, etc. 
26579 Tons of parts all work great! Broke a bolt trying to fit it through some pieces are tight and case is floppy. Not as sturdy as i expected 
26580 Not excelent quality but very useful. 
26581 😀 
26582 Crooked, won t seat straight. I have another soft release that will. So, yeah. Not great. 
26583 Excellent 
26584 too small and broke immediately 
26585 The resolution is good; sometimes I connected it with my pc. It can be mounted on a wall, or dash or wherever too, and it has a screw to tighten it at that angle for good viewing. 
26586 Very useful. Thx. 
26587 Works great thank goodness it s all metal unlike some other items I ve ordered 
26588 Perfect 
26589 Nice Product 
26590 No memory card , no reader, used battery, mismatched case, No instructions, no tripod, Camera seems used also 
26591 Works as advertised, I love it 
26592 Perfect size and quality product!! 
26593 Tried this as a replacement for my broken latch, this one broke within a week. 
26594 Can t get it smooth. It s like cardboard 
26595 The charger supplied with my new Fuji X-T1 uses a full size power cord, taking up way too much space in my camera bag. This one is much smaller and can be plugged into A USB Charger. Works great at a very good price. Recommended. 
26596 Quality and Good Price! 
26597 Works great! I use this for my Canon 5D Mark II all the time for film production. Doesn t last as long as a Canon battery of course, but does the job perfectly! 
26598 Fun Item, but GPS is not working properly 
26599 I loved that I bought this combo in less than a week I already finished the pack but I had some amazing pics instantly 
26600 works great with my 67mm lens. 
26601 Price was very good. 
26602 book needs a lot of work. We are not all professionals. 
26603 Excellent picture on the two I purchased, but one of them stopped working after two days 
26604 A gift and she truly loves it. 
26605 Jest what I wanted 
26606 They are so awesome! I will order as soon as they are gone, Great value and great items! 
26607 Hands free, comfortable, well made. I fits me well- 5-11, 195 lbs. I just hiked half dome and wish I had this, I couldn t film the cable climb because I needed both hands and didn t trust my head mount. I highly recommend. 
26608 It seems hard plastic , but glue use to keep the pole falls apart out of the box, i needed to use epoxy to put it back together again in the first try 
26609 Good price 
26610 Fits well but scratches easily! Better products out there! 
26611 Battery does not last.never used but no power after 1 month.original gossen pro meter battery lasted many years. 
26612 the up/down swivel does not work on the product i received. The product also does not come with instructions. So you have to guess which knobs to tighten and which latches do what. 
26613 Lets me use 77mm filters on my A6000 s kit lens. Thanks for making this in this odd size! 
26614 For the price you pay for this it s an awesome product. Here s a link to my personal test. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xbO0BYp2qk&sns=em 
26615 Easy to use, Not big for travel, good quality picture 
26616 thank you 
26617 Its ok for the price 
26618 This works great. Glad I got it for my NexStar 4 
26619 I Love it.. cant wait to start taking pictures!! Thanks 
26620 Excellent, as described in the publication I received, the delivery was fast without mishap, satisfied 100% 
26621 Just as described and quick shipping. 
26622 Works like a charm. Lost the charger this fits and works 
26623 Quality is great! 
26624 Good Value for the price. i like the texture of the bag. 
26625 It was fast I received my pen before Sept 10th I love this thank you 
26626 like the cameras alot, did need the tech support it was very helpful.thank you terry morgan 
26627 Works well! 
26628 No good doesn t work 
26629 did not detect motion outside, even if it did the sound was to low 
26630 I don t like typing 
26631 This item was replacement for a damaged screen. 
26632 Attached to my selfie stick for my gopro. Floats work great, easy to attach, and when tested, didn t even get close to letting the stick sink. 
26633 i love it! perfect size and everything! and the film doesnt cost too much either. i chose the free standard shipping and it took like a week and a few days to come but other than that it is great! 
26634 very nice i like it ! 
26635 powers the equipment I bought it for 
26636 Had to return product - did not work. 
26637 Worked out. 
26638 It is kinda expensive for only 10 but it came really fast 
26639 Great camera takes great pictures. I have to say I was influenced by all those Ashton Kutcher commercials. A really great value ! 
26640 Didn t hold a charge 
26641 No where in the description does it say refurbished. Guess what I received? A refurb. No paperwork. No instructions. Nothing. Its going right back out today. 
26642 Works great. 
26643 Reliable mount at an affordable price! 
26644 Durable. The middle insert that raises will sway if not held, so u need a shutter release to use it that high. Other than that, I m happy with the tripod. 
26645 perfect. 
26646 Very happy with this item. Would recommend to friends. And to the people who gave it a negative review, if you re looking for thousand dollar results,,,,buy a thousand dollar system! I am extremely happy with all functions of this system! Arrived before scheduled delivery date, works great! 
26647 I connected this camera to my phone and Wifi very easily. Very clear picture. 
26648 yup 
26649 works ok, but you can not use it with a tripod unless you anchor the bottom with a rubberband. That is what I did and it works pretty good. 
26650 I bought this for my husband who had all his go-pro stuff strung out all over the house to try to get it in one place. I was very impressed with the quality and it really does hold a lot of go-pro accessories. 
26651 It purchased for a friend and he is really enjoying the quality of the pictures this lens takes. 
26652 Nice glass! I m happy with my purchase. 
26653 This little camera is lightweight, takes great pictures and is very reliable. 
26654 Hi- Haven t used mine yet, but bought on the strong recommendation of my Marine Science major / scuba diver son and West Marine in Santa Barbara Harbor, who sells them but did not have the color I wanted. 
26655 What a scam plz read the fine print before buying 
26656 Excellent lens. Works well with my Nikon d3200. 
26657 perfect 
26658 The cost is great. 
26659 The seller sent out the camera really fast. My two kids took no time to put it together and learned how to take the videos and photos. The camera looks nice, compact, and well made. Look forward to using it in our upcoming trip. Thanks. 
26660 exactly what i purchased 
26661 Perfect 
26662 I love this lense. I am not a pro but I think this is a great lense. 
26663 What i expected 
26664 The product arrived quickly and within the time frame that was given. Everything was in clean working order and worked great for the shoot I needed them for. Thank you! 
26665 Fantastic,easy to install 
26666 Item is as described. Works great. 
26667 This is a great entry level camera. I received it sooner than I was told (a big plus) and with everything listed. As a newbie to DSLR cameras, I m really glad it came with the book. I d recommend getting an extra battery. 
26668 Thin and light but appear very strong - easy setup with just about any standard camera strap from thin to wide. 
26669 Very nice camera for my daughter 
26670 Perfect! Highly Recommended ☺ 5 ★ STARS ★ Thanks! A+ 
26671 Does the job. 
26672 Great security item for my yard 
26673 Just got back from a vacation that included Yosemitie National Park and Sanfrancisco. Great Photos, and still learning how to take advantage of this great lens. Make sure your tripod can handle this glass lens. 
26674 It s ok. I m looking into getting another battery with a larger mAh capacity. The trick is to make sure all batteries are fully powered before leaving for an event. 
26675 Loved this backpack and the color. I took it on my month long trip to Europe and now Puerto Rico. Great quality! 
26676 Great purchase! Perfect for anyone that does outdoor activities! Good to have the lcd screen to playback footage! 
26677 Excellent quality for this size camera! I use it in my classroom...the students enjoy capturing important moments. Bought one for my grandson with the camera case, and he loves using it as well. Great camera for the price. 
26678 Absolutely love this background. 
26679 Awesome product and gives much needed rigidity to the cameras frame. Would highly recommend this to anyone shooting with the sony A7 line. 
26680 Perfect fit 
26681 great locking holder 
26682 excellent product, arrived on time, works great. i would purchase from this merchant again.very happy with this product, would recommend it to friends. 
26683 Just as good as the factory original. 
26684 Great price on a multicoated filter to protect my lens. 
26685 I bought 2 batteries. 1 battery holds average charge for 1600 mAh for about 1.5 hours, another just half of that. 
26686 I use it as binoculars for which it is ok, not enough power for star gazing 
26687 I installed this system very quickly. The setup instructions could be a little clearer to understand but what s there is adequate. the system performs as advertised. I would have liked the master unit support wireless between it and modem. Other than that the system performs very nicely. 
26688 The products are awsome. The cases are very nice and protect a lot the filter and close-up lenses. 
26689 Couldn t get it to work with my system. Don t know if it was a problem with the product or just compatibility issues. 
26690 Was very impressed with this case. It will definitely protect the camera. The slinged holder also will absorb any bumps if it should happen. The light weight also is a great plus. Would definitely recommend to a friend. 
26691 Flawless. 
26692 good fit for camera. 
26693 Awesome POV! Camera is easy to access and out of the way! 
26694 Henry, he is Professional tech, he help me to set up the camera. 
26695 Product was exactly as described. Product delivered on time. 
26696 So much good and fun footage... check it out on youtube as 5280sky Enjoy!! 
26697 Love this camdera and love the price. Still learning all the features. Happy so far. 
26698 I got my case quickly and it was exactly what I wanted. 
26699 great quality. works well with screen cleaners/sprays. 
26700 Looks pretty, but it comes folded in a small envelope. It is basically the material of a thick shower curtain and I was not able to get rid of the fold creases. 
26701 Extra duration and less dollars is an excellent combination. This battery is more fragile than sony so I recommend you be careful when carrying it and keeping stored. Also works fine with neewer and yongnuo led lights 
26702 Applicator would not release from the film making it impossible to apply without creating air bubbles. Product arrived much sooner than predicted and was properly packaged. 
26703 One easy to use camera, great size, the zoom is more than great. Try it you won t be disappointed 
26704 Battery arrived promptly and works as expected. 
26705 Bad apps. Two way sound is poor quality. 
26706 Better than the ones with rubber band 
26707 Great product 
26708 Love Wasabi Power. They just know how to get it done. Works perfectly for my GoPro Hero 4 Black just like the OEM from GoPro but half the price. Get this, it s a no brainer. 
26709 Arrived on time, great film 
26710 Excellent quality as expected. Used to view archery competition and needed to be able to see fine detail. Bright and clear with little to no eye fatigue with long periods of continuous viewing. Used bi-pod support which I highly recommend with this power level. 
26711 Great! 
26712 This product is very good for those who are amateurs in Gopro film 
26713 great bundle! great compact camera! can t put it down. 
26714 Great grip for vertical photos without adding a lot of weight. 
26715 it works 
26716 I like it 
26717 instructions are microscopic and in very poor english. its being used as a real clothes hook because i dont want to throw it out 
26718 the charger worked great but the batteries do not work at all 
26719 So far so good! The burned smell really kills it though... 
26720 the best 
26721 Best deal online, was well packaged. Fast delivery, so far all of the pictures came out great, have not had any blanks or problems with the film. 
26722 Great product and prompt shipment! Thanks!! 
26723 Quality camera at a nice price. I bought the wide-angle for my quadcopter. Will get another Mobius soon with the original lens for everyday use. Very easy to use and quality video! 
26724 As others have noted, slides keep getting stuck inside and have to be removed with tweezers. Since that is the only moving part, I had hoped that they would have solved the problem. They have not. 
26725 Piece of junk. Shifts on it own. Lenses loose. Rattles. 
26726 Picture is OK. I would spend the little more and get the 1000tvl. That s what I did and I m very happy with the higher quality picture. 
26727 works just as stated 
26728 still trying to install 
26729 instructions are useless. not very happy. may return 
26730 The kit has really everything I need to capture a video in any situation, very useful and complete. Excellent product. 
26731 Used this for a macro lens conversion and it worked perfectly. 
26732 Love it! awesome camera with awesome quality of video and also can make awesome stills! 
26733 It came with an old leaking battery, I had to buy a battery in order to start using it. 
26734 Very good to see camera screen clearly on daylight. 
26735 Very satisfied with the delivery and quality of the product. 
26736 Works great with the kit lens for my Nikon D7000. Highly recommended! 
26737 Works great. A real time saver. But as others have mentioned, it s loose so a little masking tape to shim it out is necessary 
26738 Great product for a great price. Thanks again. 
26739 Works well, not really great for dark objects though. 
26740 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AX12XTC/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_11 
26741 The case itself is very nice. But the interior foam does not last long. it falls apart, fragments. If you re going to be using it frequently, consider getting hard foam for this case. 
26742 Awesome awesome awesome charger for my digital camera, absolutely love it and the replacement batteries work just as good as the originals!!! 
26743 c6722085 tech ar004273 Henry Thank you, my tech was great in helping me set up my new camera! 
26744 All good. 
26745 It works but not very easy to use. 
26746 Fits perfectly. 
26747 bad bad bad product , do not buy , is of very poor quality , lost my money , see the photo. 
26748 good 
26749 Don t buy this battery, it s a waste of money, loses battery life very quickly, It is a fake battery, so don t bother buying from this user. 
26750 ok 
26751 Took a minute to get used to......love the old school! 
26752 Prompt delivery. Work great. 
26753 These work very well. You can get a tone when door or window is opened, set them to alarm when away and even get the temperature graphed out for a day, week, month or year. Cool. These are only $15.00 at Lowes though. 
26754 Lens itself works like a charm and pictures are sharp and nice, but mount does not lock to my 400D. 
26755 Very good 
26756 works good 
26757 It was a good buy for my GoPro Hero4 
26758 These Wasabi batteries hold power just like the original Olympus battery and the charger has an integrated plug unlike the one Olympus provides (i.e. no need to carry a power cord). After 6 months of use I have nothing to complain about. 
26759 great camera with a really good zoom 
26760 Great product water tight, but WIFI button can t turn off or turn on while camera is in case 
26761 Bought this as a starter camera for a teenage film student. He s able to use all the functions easily. Takes great footage indoors and out. Also got him the Ultimate Accessory Kit to go with it and he s loving it all. 
26762 main connector to the camera broke in 10 seconds. do not buy this poorly built device 
26763 Sometimes a generic battery works, but I prefer to buy the Nikon battery for more assurance of durability and lasting power. I always carry an extra for extended photo shoots. 
26764 They are not as clear as my other D-Link set and the sound is terrible. 
26765 great product- smart design! 
26766 Excellent glasses for birding. Light weight, easy to hold on image without shake.... Can t imagine spending any more for good field glasses. 
26767 Great case and great service! 
26768 Got here in a day and and a half, great shipping, and... it s a battery..? Lol. Going on a trip in September so I ll test it s limitations then. 
26769 These batteries are, so far, performing every bit as good as the &#34;brand&#34; batteries that I have bought in the past at 4 times the cost. They are definitely a good deal. 
26770 We live in a zone where there are gangs that love to graffiti in our alley and on our house and inside the carport. Since I have installed these and sings, there has not been any graffiti. Very happy. 
26771 Wonderful product!!! they give you a lot of product for a cheap price. It worked instantly for all of my lens s. I recommend these! 
26772 Nice and good for gopro. Is very easy to fit all the accessories and the camera 
26773 It works as it should! 
26774 The camera image is blurry and is very slow in capturing motion, a sometimes I am not able to look at image because camera image was all black 
26775 Works as advertised. Great for vacations where the camera battery might run out & need two to get thru day 
26776 Slides on with a friction fit. Fits nicely. Very light weight. Glossy finish so will reflect light into lens, so I will use some steel wool to roughen up the surface. 
26777 My son has a lot of Camera s .I didn t think I could fine a bag big enough buy WOW this is the Bag.He thought it was great and so did all his friends 
26778 somehow, my husband managed to misplace his battery charger for the camera I bought him. I got the idea to order a replacement from my best friend, and I m so glad I followed through. Now camera works after a year of a missing charger! 
26779 Very nice and powerfull lens 
26780 Works great! 
26781 Good. Sturdy. Great Quality C Stand 
26782 Definitely helpful as you start to stack up the photos. More pages than I would ve imagined, as it can hold quite the amount of film! Arrived in good condition, good quality, a great buy if you re to use the Instax camera. 
26783 more than what i expected for the price 
26784 It is perfect, inexpensive and does exactly what it says it will do. Arrived on time 
26785 Great product. Great service A++++ 
26786 Product was returned. Camera itself seemed to work well but app is not friendly with older foscam cameras and old / most recent foscam app does not work with this camera when you have other old cameras as well.. Foscam needs a single app to control all cameras 
26787 The lens caps arrive quickly and fit my camera perfectly. The strap will keep me from losing the lens cap. The bundle is great because I have two lenses and two caps for backup. 
26788 The clip fits my phone, but the only that that stinks is taking the cover off the phone so it can fit in the clip. Other then that it is a good buy. 
26789 Too expensive! Same quality as generic but you pay 4x more for this one. Lose yours? Buy a 4 pack genetic for a dollar less than this single cap. 
26790 I purchased this for our upcoming trip. This is a great device for night time pictures when you want to minimize camera movement. Works well with my Nikon D3100. 
26791 I ordered 2 sets and only one unit out of the 4 would make connection with any of my flashes. The other 3 units would not react the pins on my flashes to trigger them. I tried all my SB-900 s, SB-700 s and 1 SB-26. 
26792 Great product my boyfriend loves it ! 
26793 First of all the lens advertised was a Samyang lens but what actually ships was a Rokinon lens.They both had a F6.3 rating though.Go figure. I couldn t get the T-mount to attach and fully lock unto my Sony a-37 camera. A partial attachment just won t cut it. 
26794 Fast & sharp, less color and image aberration on borders. It is definitely an upgrade of its predecesor. I recommend it ! 
26795 nice but you realy need an optical viewfinder 
26796 There are several cut outs in the foam, but none of them are very clear of their intention. However, the case is great otherwise. 
26797 I use this to protect my laptop screen for the oils on the keys 
26798 Fast shipping, good product. My old Canon A50 is purring once again in all its digital glory! 
26799 this case came earlier than i expected! it s adorable and exactly what i wanted! thank you so much!! 
26800 Excellent. 
26801 Great product delivered as advertised. 
26802 I m very proud of these items. 
26803 The best deal ever! Outstanding start up camera and accessories for a new DSLR person! 
26804 Pretty good, it sticks well. But the Aperture wheel and Shutter Speed wheel are not even as close as the original ones on the camera. So leaves a three star. 
26805 Would not work with remote. 
26806 It would not hold my Samsung Zoom. So I m not using it at all....gave it away. 
26807 makes the picture not sharp 
26808 Excellent lens for the money 
26809 Need it to keep my Dremel Tool charged. 
26810 Good style and very easy to use. with my EOS 5D and 24-105 Len. 
26811 I love it ! It is a great and useful product. 
26812 Great to use but stopped working after a year with light use 
26813 does not fit on the Go Pro 4 
26814 Works as it should. STRONG clip spring. Can t go wrong if you have a need for this kind of rig. 
26815 They display screen was broke 
26816 This product does not work properly, the software is out of date, and something I didn t know is that COBY went out of business in 2013, so there isn t a website or a customer service # to help troubleshoot the issues. DO not buy this product! 
26817 Built well and no slippage when locked! 
26818 This works great. The remote doesn t have to be pointed right at the plug in to turn the light on and off. It makes turning the light on and off super easy. 
26819 I wanted to like this so bad, but the fact that you have to watch a light blink to figure out what is going on is a major con for me. Too confusing. 
26820 Inexpensive, works great! Highly recommend if you need to replace your oem charger or if you just need an extra charger! 
26821 Was a gift to my mom. She really likes the camera and all the accessories that came with it. 
26822 Good quality. Comes with a case that holds all the parts--some others don t. 
26823 Hi!! I received my selfie stick with a problem. Thank u for pay attention to my coment. Sincerely Julio Mejia. 
26824 Great product 
26825 This product is not endorsed by Nest. It is a third party affiliate. 
26826 These are not original DJI. They caused my Phantom 2 Vision to fly anyway it wanted. It wouldn t respond to the controller at all. Put the original blades on and it flew normally. These blades cause me to crash my Phantom several times. 
26827 Nice little set for a great price. We mainly bought it for the float, which worked nicely while snorkeling, but we also put the selfie stick on it during a dive to get video of some harder to get places. 
26828 The ítem did come on handheld for me. It replaced my ítem guay no longer worked. 
26829 Great product. Good price. Fast delivery! 
26830 As advertised. Adjustable so it can accommodate larger hands. Very good quality. 
26831 So happy with my purchase!! The camera came earlier than expected, which is always awesome!! we ve had a blast using it this far, can t wait to take it in the cruise!! 
26832 Excellent 
26833 This tripod is great. I needed something to support a small portable projector and other mini tripods would not do it. They just collapsed. This holds it up without any flimsiness and the positionable legs are great. Highly recommend this tripod. 
26834 Arrived timely, precision cut and fit. It is a great product for new Go Pro users. Was unable to road test it, due to cancellation of trip due to weather, but it will be road tested. If it fails the test, you will be hearing from me. 
26835 Excellent camera, with all the features I wanted and more. 
26836 BAD QUALITY. Very flimsy plastic. I expected better. No instructions and I can t tell what goes with what! 
26837 System instructions are very poor. You are unable to setup the wireless cameras if you do not have a windows PC so MAC users do not buy this system. Returned to Amazon for a refund 
26838 I could not get it to link up to my smart phone. I tried everything I could. 
26839 Simple camera great forntakin pic of any and everything I wouldn t use it for photo shoots but serves its purpose takes great pics of my kids when they are silly and crazy lol 
26840 Great product. Easy installation and durable. Have had for my property for over 2 years and no problems. 
26841 I sent it back. It would not maintain a network connection well enough to be usable. Tried it with apple, Windows phone and android. Definitely a bust. 
26842 battery has very poor performance. it only functions a very short time before the battery is dead. I would like to return these two items. 
26843 Got it really quick. works perfect 
26844 Really nice and simple to use 
26845 Works great 
26846 NOT ONLY WAS THIS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT, IT WAS ALSO THE LEAST EXPENSIVE OF ALL RETAILERS THAT I CHECKED. 
26847 Fits my JCV record 
26848 Had to send camera back to manufacturer within a few months. It came apart. They did send me a new one. It was just a hassle to have something brand new that fell apart. 
26849 helps keep stands from tipping over and easy to see 
26850 It s good for the price but the things look a bit cheap the selfie sometimes twists with my iphone 6 plus to heavy for it. One of the lenses is two pieces in one and it came apart. But over all for the price its ok. 
26851 Does the job. 
26852 works as promised. 
26853 This is my third Canon digital SLR. Amazing cameras for the price! Very forgiving. Be sure to check out all the special features and program the camera to your liking. 
26854 Fits great 
26855 not bad 
26856 works great, now we know when someone enters our yard 
26857 Works great for such an oldie I love the way the picture turn out and the assisted focus is really cool, and it s hipster, how many other people have an al-1 everybody has the aw-1 
26858 Much slower than I thought it would be. I miss the rapid shoot feature on my previous camera. Not a good camera for taking quick succession shots. 
26859 Im loved no more strees. Protects the flash falla and better movility 
26860 outside very hot is dropcam feel hot is broke i call nest support shipper new dropcam only inside 
26861 Works great, just as advertised. 
26862 Great price for all you get. 
26863 Fantastic sling and fantastic value for its quality. 
26864 No marker to know where to attach to lens and won t sit in the case like before. Plastic is very thin and cheap. 
26865 Under powered. Returned unit, then struggled with vendor to get refund. It did appear to be well built. 
26866 luckily I could get, I saved my machine lens 
26867 These are awesome cameras for the price. Very clear picture day and night. WAY better than my older Sony cameras. Very Pleased! 
26868 Doesn t work. Charged, but it wouldn t turn on, and then not charge after. Cheap junk. 
26869 Vincent was great, I love my camera, great product 
26870 doesnt fix, 
26871 It s great 
26872 Excellent quality. secure and comfortable around the neck line. 
26873 Great little camera 
26874 Very fast delivery. Satisfied with the quality, its just that the size is 1cm wider for a Samsung NX2000 screen. 
26875 awesome better stable shots 
26876 Nice clean low light primary lens. Auto Focus works properly with motor in camera. It is another great lens from Nikkor 
26877 Good Batteries - provide 2h 21m for Sony Handicam HDR CX220 
26878 Great package! 
26879 GREAT replacement for the original GoPro batteries which cost a crap ton more. These even hold a longer charge it seems. 
26880 Great for nature, light, water resistant. Comes with case and lense covers. 
26881 It s okay, quality is good but it is kind of hard to use with my camera. It makes it hard to reach the shutter. 
26882 I feel like it s priced a bit high but it does work very well and is probably exactly what you re looking for if you ended up here. It s solid and works much better than trying to hold your hand or something over the screen. 
26883 Good battery 
26884 Came without monitor I have to spend 200 more to get all stay away! 
26885 Nice pattern and fabric but can be difficult to fold down. 
26886 Best home wi-fi camera on the market. Simple to set up. 
26887 Love it!!!- 
26888 they are awesome 
26889 This is the real DJI parts, not fake like some others advertised! 
26890 Simple enough to put together. Don t like the little ring that can be seen on camera at night. Without that it would be 5 stars. 
26891 Very good quality 
26892 I can t say enough about this little drone. Flies so well!! So simple to fly I bought them for my 8 and 10 year old kids. They love them!! Almost indestructible. If your thinking about getting one... GET IT! You wont regret it! 
26893 As a newbie to Go Pro, there is more than enough in this kit to keep me occupied. I went through everything and tried out several. Fit and finish is great. The only thing that I would like to see is a compartmentalized case large enough to hold everything. 
26894 Exactly as described. Shipped immediately. 
26895 Lots of tech for not that much money. Loads of fun especially if you are looking for a different perspective on photography. 
26896 Product was fine. five star 
26897 Mount was hard to slip onto the mount. 
26898 Arrived early! And the paper works as advertised! 
26899 So far this is awesome. 10 minute setup Very good broadcast for a wireless camera. Going to get some more and see how they tie together. 
26900 Works great and floats decent enough 
26901 well made. The pop-out foam is not a perfect fit but not a big issue.mu 
26902 Great chest strap. you forget you are wearing the chest strap. This is the much better than wearing it on your head. 
26903 Great variety of mounts for temporary FILMING situations. Set it and forget it. 
26904 Another cheap alternative to GO PRO big dollar mounts works well I use it in vehicle don t know if i would mount it on the outside of car 
26905 satisfied 
26906 Good fit, finish and function. 
26907 The cameras are high quality with great resolution. I added this system to my garage to supplement the system I already installed on my home. The software is easy to use and I am pleased with the initial quality and use. 
26908 The products are working fine. Good quality. 
26909 Works like a charm !!! The Little dot in the center of the receiver turns on a BRIGHT BLUE when the unit is on which makes this even nicer than we thought. 
26910 Very nice Camera, I have had mine for 3 years and it still shoots very well. Animal shots can be very hard to get and its very lightweight and I can carry it in my pocket wherever I go. 
26911 pretty straight forward, they do what they re supposed to. these are nice. would buy again 
26912 Great binoculars. I didn t realize how much better they could be until I spent the money on some quality optics. I wished I had bought them sooner. Really awesome in low light. 
26913 Very nice small digital microscope. To maintain a clear image, the microscope must be held steady...even the slightest movement will affect the image and deliver erroneous measurements. If you intent to use this for measuring, definitely get the precision stand 
26914 They re buoyant and colorful but way too big for a woman s wrist- It can be worn on the upper arm 
26915 I have been using it for about a week now. The quality of the product is great. Very versatile as it can be adjusted in size (fits in my backpack). 
26916 Grate 
26917 This camera is amazing, I have a d610 that I really like, but the d750 has made it the backup camera 
26918 Excellent 
26919 Using it for my Fuji X1S. Cost one third of original battery but performs equally well. 
26920 Fits well, cheap 
26921 300 photos and still on a single charge. 
26922 Good lens 
26923 Great film. I develop it in TMax developer. I like Fuji Acros, too. The two seem pretty similar to my eye but I usually use Fuji. Gotta help keep Kodak going, too, though. 
26924 Batteries dont last very long like the name brand ones but overall worth the money for a back up 
26925 Okay, but not worth the money though. 
26926 Awesome 
26927 Arrived on time and as described. 
26928 This does the job, but occasionally hard to pan back to different angles and lags. 
26929 Excellent grip 
26930 Great product. 
26931 just as advertized 
26932 The camera is nice, setup was easy. The deal breaker for me was all the videos I tried downloading to my phone were so fragmented and choppy that they were unusable. Otherwise the live viewing was fine and the settings were easy to navigate. 
26933 wouldn t need so many if collar had an ON/OFF Switch thankfully I bought them 
26934 product does what it is suppose to, links my phone to my computer via usb. the choice of delivery personal ment it went to my next door neihbor though since obviously the delivery man(woman) cant read those big huge numbers that shows my address up on my house. 
26935 Excellent 
26936 I highly recommend this case. The EOS came ina red color such as the inside of the case... but is very helpfull if you want to carry your camera with an extra battery and maybe some extra memory. 
26937 Not very happy with the product. The quality of the products are little cheap. The tripod is very light and usable though. 
26938 Works flawlessly.. AMAZING night time video (night driver).. 
26939 Excellent camera! 
26940 Inexpensive monopod is great for alternative to paying top-dollar for an authentic pro monopod. 
26941 Works well, came charged. Like that they have a Canadian store 
26942 Original GoPro died after a year. The Wasabi s, after a year and a half are still going strong. 
26943 Good value for price 
26944 Picture quality as expected. Great price compared to retail store pricing. 
26945 Works awesome. Batteries last similar time to the gopro ones. Nice to have extra batteries and a dual charger. Haven t used the car charger yet, but I m assuming it works fine. 
26946 Extremely nice unit, stable, flexible, nicely packaged, folds well into small, light size with handy carrying case. 
26947 The product is great my son loves it. I would also like to thank Winston for his wonderful customer service. 
26948 I love this camera I have it behine the window its clear also not ir at nite indoor be awsome 
26949 I love this camera. And the setup help that I received from D-Link was excellent! The tech, Jasmine (AR00426) was so nice, patient and helpful. I would definitely recommend this camera and D-Links support service. This is case #C6719277 
26950 Nice product. 
26951 I ve used it a couple of times and its worked perfectly. Thanks! 
26952 Item arrived in about 3 days and it was as advertised and worked perfectly. Would buy from dealer again. 
26953 Handy solution if ou always lose lens caps 
26954 This pack is well made and nicely cushioned. It fits a T3i Rebel just right. The velcro &#34;shelf&#34; at the bottom is adjustable so you can use the pack when you have the kit lens on the camera or a longer one. 
26955 Just got the batteries and charger in the mail last week. It s working great so far 
26956 Takes awhile to set up on the software end of things, but the functionality is great once you re able to get everything up and running. 
26957 was the exact as the store bought. it fit everything I needed, and I still had room 
26958 Excellent kit, great seller, great customer service, great warranty offered!!! A mandatory kit for anyone with a Nikon DSLR!!! 
26959 It worked. 
26960 Works as well as OEM and much cheaper. 
26961 Batteries work great and is way easier than charging one battery at a time 
26962 Works reasonably well. It is lightweight and a bit flimsy. Not particularly compact or easy to travel with but it s a pretty solid choice for a tripod. Anyways, it s cheaper than other brands so I recommend this. 
26963 Received as new 
26964 Such a precious gift for our 6-year-old! She loves is and has had tons of fun making Instax photos in a flash! 
26965 Arrived on time, and as expected 
26966 Placed in camera immediately! 
26967 Excelent product. 
26968 Great tough little bag! 
26969 The product came as advertised and functions just as advertised! It s a great product for the price! 
26970 Great seller ,product as picture 
26971 Great camera bag, sturdy, padded, lots of pockets, just wish it was a little bigger. 
26972 Probably the best purchase I have ever made. Love everything about it. Easy to use. Easy to transfer onto a computer. Great quality. 
26973 I prefer a wrist strap because it is less bulky and I dislike having a camera swinging around my neck. 
26974 Fast shipping, batteries charge extremely quick!! 
26975 Great Quality Product. Does everything that I want from a Circular Polarizer. Breakthough Photography is emerging as a big player in the photography filter market. I am Pleased! 
26976 Too bad 
26977 Battery meets with all my expectations and does the job. 
26978 Love it I have been able to use this to take professional pictures for products I sell on Amazon and on my website. It had to ison it out to remove the lines. 
26979 Takes a little bit time to set it up with SmartThings. Also the refreshing interval is too long and you cannot adjust it. 
26980 Great batteries long long battery life 
26981 I recommend this to everyone. This camera has night vision and motion detection. I use in my childs room and my business. You should order this. 
26982 Great binoculars for the price 
26983 Great underwater camera with good images with existing light. However, flash photos are not as good as standard point and shoot. 
26984 Camera is gray camera not warranted by Nikon. Products within kit are all low quality. Vendor poorly packaged product and it arrived damaged. 
26985 Great 
26986 there was no button on the bottom to click to take a picture and it is not 21&#34;, it is much shorter. 
26987 you will not get a better lense for 99 US-dollars. 
26988 If you have less knowledge about setting up such a cam then choose another product. The whole interface and simplicity of setting up this camera is far beyond dlink standard. Don t buy it. 
26989 Worked perfectly with my Nikon Coolpix. 
26990 Great 
26991 Ideal 
26992 This little camera bag has come in so handy!! I am able to fit some light snacks and some loose bills for our theme park adventures. Also, the inside is padded and I know our little camcorder is supported and safe. 
26993 Love it! Works great. 
26994 Great camera, very durable 
26995 Seems like just what I was looking for. Faster shutter speed and high quality pictures. 
26996 Extremely comfortable and versatile strap. I use it everyday and experience no pain in my shoulders whatsoever. I recommend this to anybody who carries their DSLR with them all day 
26997 Worth every penny and more. Operates at the same level and higher cspacity than $50 OEM battery units. No issues with my Canon EOS Rebel XT. 
26998 6 months passed but it still works well 
26999 I love these little things as hotshoe covers. 
27000 Is cool 
27001 Motion detection not accurate. It sends u a snapshot after the person is out of frame and still sends u notifications when that camera is not supposed to. The night vision is not good unless you are really close. 
27002 An excellent binocular at moderate price. 
27003 Phantom and accessories fit perfectly, and it s right size for carryon baggage. Went on a hike in the pouring rain with this on my back, didn t get to fly with the weather, but all kept dry. 
27004 Beware!!!! Do Not Purchase!!!! The Controller Does Not Pair With The Drone!!!! Total Waist Of money!! 
27005 Works well for an after market charger and the car charger was an added bonus. 
27006 great camera 
27007 Now, I never have to worry about having a dead battery. 
27008 More than i expected 
27009 It meets my needs. 
27010 I attached it to my camera. I went into the water. My camera floated. End of story. 
27011 Bad quality, for the price its bad. 
27012 Love it 
27013 For the price, it s a good quality filter, cheapest among the brand names purporting multi-coated surface. Build quality is good and screws on the lens smoothly. Does not degrade image on a consumer DLSR and lens and effectively protects the front element. 
27014 excelent 
27015 I got this for my son and it was perfect. It as exactly what he wanted 
27016 Works great. Perfect for traveling. 
27017 the handles came off the moment I put it on the camera. 
27018 Charges but came broken so I have to tie the battery in to make it stay. 
27019 SD cards fit great, Very good buy 
27020 Works as good as a new one. 
27021 Low price. Works great. 
27022 received item very quickly.....its works great!!!! 
27023 I think that it is such a great product for such a great price!! it s working great without any problems. 
27024 It s easy to use and transport. I d just prefer that it was a bit more powerful as I continue to have shadows in certain places while filming. 
27025 put this in a derby car over the weekend and it took a lot of hard hits and for it being plastic, I am amazed at how well it held. 
27026 This camera took a few attempts to get it hooked up to our wifi and phones correctly, but once we did it has been great! It seamlessly switches from regular to IR and the speaker and microphone work great. 
27027 Great experience with this order. Camera is as advertised and shipped quickly. I m already looking into accessories. Would use merchant with confidence. 
27028 Great quality...strong wifi signal! 
27029 This is the best 4k camera for the buck. Loving my new machine 
27030 The lens cap bundle arrived in a timely manner. The caps do the job required by our staff. 
27031 I received a wrong item 
27032 It s works as expected only issue is it discharges very fast when I use rechargeable batteries. Works best with disposable. Bought new rechargeable thinking the old ones couldn t cut it but same issue with the new. 
27033 Good only for about a year. When you warranty is up that s it. NO fixing or replacement. Really bad deal 3 out of 4 gone bad and the 4th doesn t work well 
27034 Very good ... 
27035 Just as good as the $100 version. Autofocus in most cases is not needed because the focal range is so small....although this product provides for autofocus in both types of Canon lens I have yet to use auto focus. 
27036 This is a great little air blaster. It gets all the bits of dust off my lens and camera, and it s small enough to squeeze into my camera bag. I specifically didn t want the larger models because they looked huge, so this one fits the bill just right. 
27037 Great space for camera and side pockets for batteries and USB cable. 
27038 DJI can do no wrong with me they make good product all around. 
27039 it was good 
27040 Works really well. Only thing is - You have to remember to turn on the microphone. I forget sometimes. That s on me, not on them. 
27041 Great quality and lots of extras but the case is a little flimsy 
27042 Very good product for the price!! Do the job!!!! 
27043 Gotta have it because the original battery power doesn t last as long as this. 
27044 Perfect for me who has 2 gopro hero 4s and a lot of accessories.. not everything fits but this helps a lot 
27045 cute! 
27046 I bought this for my Nikon D5200. It fits the 18-55mm lens perfectly, but will not fit anything larger. The little zipper in the lid is great for an extra memory card or my wireless remote. 
27047 Love it work real good and clear 
27048 I got this as a birthday present on August 27th, 2015 and I love it so much. I had the wide instax and wasn t sure if this would be too small a size photo but it s perfect. 
27049 Excellent binoculars which I used for my African Safari. 
27050 I live in the mountains and have a large front porch which is where I installed this. It s located high enough to where nobody can touch it without using a ladder. 
27051 grate i wish i can fine more seniors though lol. 
27052 Works well👍🏼 
27053 excelent 
27054 Not quite as solid feeling as my Canon 600 ex-rt. but it gets the job done. Would have gotten five stars except for the feel. Also less than half the cost of the Canon flash. 
27055 a toy 
27056 while shooting an event, some of my shoots came out warm colors and others very cold. Hope I can figure out this issue by next event, other than that, great item, easy to use, lots of functions, great price, fast delivery. 
27057 Excellent for the money. Use it for video work. 
27058 Works well, just as advertised. 
27059 Love this lens. It s great to have the wide angle option for my Canon digital SLR. And the price is right! 
27060 Absolutely great 
27061 Fits the LX100 great, opens up when the camera is powered on, highly recommended if you don t want to fiddle with the lens cap. 
27062 Great product, works great, thank you! 
27063 Holds all of my camera goods with space for more, I fit my camera and three lenses all in it, also cleaning supplies and straps fit well! 
27064 Fits my Go Pro Silver 
27065 Good 
27066 Excellent! 
27067 plastic and cheap feel, digital viewfinder was fuzzy and slow to catch up when moved. 
27068 Excellent 
27069 So tiny! 
27070 Excellent case keeps the gopro in place. Highly recommended, Purchase with confidence. 
27071 Very nice product 
27072 These power packs worked just fine. No problems. 
27073 go to the tube and see how to works.... first install the usb to ur pc.charged it? then follow how it works. just got it..meeennnn im going to bust this bastard dr s that take advantage of my spinal cord injury..the video is perfect.even the picture works great.tku 
27074 Awesome 
27075 Extremely well made. Comfortable to carry. The quick release straps rather stiff to start. Expensive but you can see and feel the quality. The chocolate color straps look more orange than brown in reality. 
27076 Easy to use, sturdy, comes with a storage bag. Well made tripod. 
27077 This will give you plenty of light for portraiture or any setting where you are not firing it over and over again. For serious event work. No. It will leave you hanging. The hvlf43m runs circles around this flash for event work. 
27078 nice 
27079 Picture Quality is horrible, Mic only works for the person holding the camera, the ones you are recording literally have to shout to hear you and there is no light other than that its ok... 
27080 good product, very fast service. 
27081 Stopped working after one use, and the sound was terrible 
27082 Very nice case. Much more utility than I expected. It also appears to be well made. I know I ll get years of service from this case. 
27083 This bundle is great. Everything works perfectly. And you sure Can t beat the price. Definitely recommend 
27084 Works the way they said it would 
27085 Came when they said it would. 
27086 Very *very* slight fuchsia hue, but the real problem comes on cold mornings. On two occasions these frosted completely and were totally unusable since it was like shooting through opaque glass instead of clear. Put it away on humid and cold occasions, figure something else out instead. 
27087 Works perfect for my application. And it is relatively light which is a requirement. 
27088 Great product. Works perfectly on my Sony A6000. I highly recommend it. 
27089 Too many unusable pixels , too much noise beyond 400. 
27090 They work well was expecting some bigger cameras tho. And the night vision is good! 
27091 Worked perfectly 
27092 Fabulous pics..... 
27093 not match with D40.cheap made bad quality.not recommend 
27094 The glasses were wonderful but the strap was not good at all. The weight of the binoculars made the strap cut into your neck. 
27095 I ordered two of these photo frames and upon receipt one wouldn t even power on and the other frame s color on the screen was very distorted. 
27096 Very poor quality photo and video. Set it to he 1080p setting and tried everything to get the best picture; never happened. Not sure why in the world there are anything over a one star review on this. Returning asap to Amazon. Don t waste your money on this. 
27097 Noisey play in the follow knob, pics up on mics. It s a good cheap follow focus to get practice on in spare time 
27098 These are quality lights that I wish I had purchased a long time ago. Although a carrying case isn t included, the small boxes can easily fit into a duffel bag for easy travel. 
27099 excellent quality and helps when moving stands 
27100 Perfect lens for birth photography! 
27101 Wish I could find more. They seem not to exist! 
27102 This works. It does not work with Polar Pro filters attached though. 
27103 great 
27104 Love that it has the double cameras for a broader view. We want purchase two more for all our vehicles. 
27105 Great 
27106 Much appreciated, if sold at more reasonable price. 
27107 Excellent lens. It is a bit heavy, but to me that s what a quality lens should feel like. 
27108 This is exactly what it says it is, a lens cap for Canon EOS EF 18-55. I had accidentally lost mine, and this was the perfect replacement. 
27109 Meh, the video on your phone is better unless you live in 1980. Move on. 
27110 Got this on a ridiculous deal to use on our Honeymoon in Belize. No water ever got into the camera. All you had to make sure was that it was sealed and that the gasket was covering it well. 
27111 Great for the type of camera that I own. 
27112 This viewer does not work, and unfortunately, I will return it. Rounded cornered slides work fine, but squared cornered slides get stuck and do not eject from the viewer. 
27113 I don t use it for anything but landscapes as the focus softens anything with sharp detail is not up to standards. 
27114 Saving much money since I no longer need to constantly purchase lithium batteries for my dog s invisible fence collar. One of the best decisions I have made lately, and I will be looking into buying similar chargers for other battery sizes! 
27115 Great little camera 
27116 Great camera for the money for sure! I say you should buy it! 
27117 These lens cases are great! Good quality with a soft lining for extra protection. Definitely recommend!! 
27118 The quality is not the best 
27119 Just what I needed 
27120 Descent case , good price. No complain 
27121 Worked well and easy to control. Setup just takes a little bit of effort. 
27122 My daughter loved it, exactly what she needed for photo class. TY 
27123 Super bright and amazing. Great price. Very happy. 
27124 excellent quality, but the backdrops are wrinkled, so I brought them to get pressed, which costed me an extra $30.00 for all 3. 
27125 Excellent Product 
27126 Couldn t get it to work with my internet, never got it to show up in my computer or phone 
27127 love it 
27128 Decent quality case at a modest price. Bought for Canon G16, loose fit for the camera. 
27129 This worked perfectly for my camera. 
27130 Perfect quality!! 
27131 Great buy. Would defenely recommend it. 
27132 Good replacement 
27133 Very happy with this lens. Used it on a full moon shoot and was pleased with the results. For the price, can t go wrong. 
27134 I love this filter. Used it for sunset and beach shots this summer and the effects were stunning. Highly recommended. 
27135 Everything came as ordered and works fine. 
27136 DSTE is the best non OEM grip out there period! I ve tried 3 others and this grip is by far better. The build is spot on with the OEM and all buttons/knobs work just like the OEM. The seller shipped fast from China and it arrived 8 days early. 
27137 Good Product Works as expected 
27138 Does what it s supposed to do. Solid build. 
27139 Worked exactly as written. 
27140 good for the price 
27141 Decent for the size. Has some trouble with light correction but worked fine with my fatshark goggles and a hawkeye transmitter for 5.8 ghz fpv. 
27142 Great value! 
27143 Great product 
27144 This is tripod is cool, a good deal, and does exactly what it is supposed to do. I am specifically using it for my compact Nikon, CoolPix camera, and it holds perfectly. 
27145 for peace of mind a low cost worth every penny.. 
27146 Great Tripod 
27147 They do jut what you expect batteries to do, charge and discharge. 
27148 Work good I am so happy I could used my camcorder again I fix it my self. 
27149 Great products, would recommend for everyone 
27150 Great color and very sharp photos! Last of the great 35 mm film for my great film cameras. 
27151 @ 6 months - Defective Monitor ! shuts down! occasionally needs to be Reset? 
27152 Works as well if not better than originals for a fraction of the price! 
27153 Useful product! Liked it. 
27154 This is not compatible with a p900. I called Nikon to confirm. DO NOT PURCHASE 
27155 great clear pictures and easy to use beats my I-Phone for pictures 
27156 wow what a package and all of them are useful. but yes i havent used all of them yet. But i really liked everything and all are of good standard. Exceeded my expectation really. 
27157 Fantastic. Incredible picture. Incredible price. Great bundle - all good stuff. These people are fantastic. Excellent customer service, fast shipping. Great in all respects. 
27158 It s defective....but I did not know that at that time so I could not return and I wasted money... 
27159 AAAAAA+++++ 
27160 Great camera. 
27161 Love this camera, easy to use, love the look of the camera and the case! I would recommend to all! The mini photos were a hit at the party in the photo booth! Just wish I would have purchased the mini photo album book to put the pictures in! 
27162 Real solid one 
27163 The wifi is not working i tested this cam with ios and android 
27164 Didn t work with my camera so I cannot review it. Make sure your camera can do wireless 
27165 I got this for my daughter fro her 10th birthday and she LOVED it! Great gift! 
27166 I had to send it back because it was way too big and bulky for my needs. The leather was a really poor quality and the front straps that snap were cumbersome. 
27167 More pink than red not to happy 
27168 I m fairly happy with this purchase. The only complaint I have is the length of the quick connect straps is too long and looks ridiculous hanging off the camera so I never remove the strap. 
27169 The product is great. Lightweight, portable and easy to use. There was a delay in the shipping for some unknown reason but Amazon gave me a $20 refund for the inconvenience. 
27170 works 
27171 It s great for getting tubes on video 
27172 No problems with product and/or delivery. Works as described. 
27173 great 
27174 This camera isn t really that good. The Mydlink site has a time limit on continuous viewing. There are several more things, but why pile it on? 
27175 This arrived safely and as scheduled. It fits okay but acceptable with some adjusting; but not a perfect fit. 
27176 it works just fine, no problems at all :) 
27177 It is awesome! It is way bigger than it appears, I highly recommend this product, it s perfect for a camera and some small stuff. 
27178 Great Value, works great 
27179 Solid stand, no issues. 
27180 Good product 
27181 Love nest cam, except for 15% of the time when it says &#34;offline&#34;. I also have a thermostat which rarely goes offline, so I know its not my internet connection. Also, why is the subscription cost so high? I would get it, if it wasnt a ripoff. 
27182 Plug in didn t work well. had to adjust in all the time in the socket, still. good batteries, good price. 
27183 Haven t used every item as of late, but what I have used works as intended. 
27184 Perfect fit. No issues , great service and delivery right on time. 
27185 Cheap plastic 
27186 works great, good value, fast shipper. 
27187 I bought this little guy for my gopro. Its definitely not &#34;heavy duty&#34; as the product description states but gets the job done. Great little tripod for the price. 
27188 I recommend, fast delivery. very good 
27189 Great Price and easy to use.. 
27190 My daughter loves the product. Customer Service and product expectations where met. Love it. 
27191 I have dozens of rechargeable batteries that I use for photography. This is great because it holds them reasonably snug and with the two partitions, I can keep the charged and depleted batteries separate. There aren t many cases like this, so this was great. 
27192 Came two days early. Great surprise!! Excellent condition. Looks and feels brand new. Great buy!! 
27193 Not the exact copy of the Nikon part however the form fit and function is right-on. Excellent Service from the vendor. Ordered two additional sets of caps just in case one is lost or comes off again. 
27194 Great price for the cleaning set. The Purosol solution really cleaned up my lens after snapping pics at a teppanyaki restaurant. It would be nice to have an extra pack of Altura lens paper. 
27195 I like the camera but when using the fisheye lens underwater, water gets between the fisheye and normal camera lens. 
27196 Fits - timely delivery 
27197 Works great, the wifi remote with this adds to the value. 
27198 I was pleased with fast shipping and Lens is perfectly and I love it.:) Thank you 
27199 Fits well, easy to put on and take off. 
27200 I like that i can charge 2 batteries at the same time. Great buy 
27201 I ordered the black backdrop but received the white. It did come in one day though. 
27202 It is not quite comparable to Vera Hub 
27203 excelent extra life for your camera 
27204 For the amount of money this cost me the quality should have been a lot better. And now I can t get rid of the thing for even half that amount. 
27205 Great product 
27206 It s nice and big, but almost too heavy to hold itself up. The rod on the umbrella bends a bit. I m worried it may break eventually or bend too much. But for now, it works and gives me a nice big reflective surface at a good price. 
27207 Order came in fast and was well packaged. Easy to assemble and get operational. Home security even on the road. Which we tested while away on a long weekend. 
27208 Good 
27209 Cowboy studio has the best equipment for the price 
27210 Fit perfect! Serves its UV purposes but also peace of mind in protecting my lens face. 
27211 Fills up with water and then does not float 
27212 Sprays just enough air to make it work for small spaces. Perfect and no need to use nasty chemicals. 
27213 great! 
27214 I have more pieces of equipment than I know what to do with. But, I will figure it out. I look forward to more professional photos for my website. 
27215 The Oly Pro lens are great. 
27216 They arrived on time and they were great 
27217 Manual focus, manual aperture, and no image stabilization. I m using it on a APS-C SLR in AE mode. Creamy texture for landscapes and a wonderful lens for group pictures. I will be using this on my (all manual) film camera also - the advantage of older lenses being non-gelded. 
27218 Good replacement battery for my camera. 
27219 It was everything I hoped for 
27220 Great one! Should buy 
27221 Awesome for the price. 
27222 good 
27223 Quick, fast, simple, easy 
27224 lots of vignette 
27225 Nice album for instant prints. 
27226 Expensive for how long it lasted. picture quality/ auto-zoom mechanism deteriorated quite quickly (my family can be a little hard on electronics, but no so hard that it s unreasonable). Vast majority of pictures don t zoom quite right. Better with an iphone at this point. 
27227 It s too lightweight so it tips over with a heavy smartphone. 
27228 working as intended 
27229 This product doesn t let you face your camera forward which makes it useless to me if the only thing it s capturing is a side view. 
27230 Works as advertised. Compact and good workmanship. 
27231 It is light and protect the Phantom 3 and all parts. Really nice product. 
27232 Very quick shipment. Quality item. 
27233 Great experience. Very fast shipping. Thanks. 
27234 I bought 3 of this, 2 had to returned, its either the plug in adapter not working, or not working properly! and only the first one works within 4-6 feet! 
27235 got this camera when it first came out; love it. I have taken thousands of pictures with it; never had a problem with it. will keep this camera till it dies. 
27236 Great suction mount! A great buy with a low price. GoPro s version is like 4 times as much and just as good 
27237 The product is excellent and easy to use, it charges all my batteries without problem and since I read that some of the customers had problems with putting in or taking off the battery but I ve haven t experience that. Mine runs smooth for the Canon T3 bats 
27238 Great batteries and charger. I use them for my Nikon d90, and have never had a problem! 
27239 Great price. 
27240 Delivered as expected...works great!! 
27241 Works as advertised 
27242 The flash work beautiful with my camera. Have it professional output. 
27243 Great Cam! Easy to set up & use. 
27244 Perfect 
27245 Um.. Great case, but it s a square rectangular shape that looks a little boxy... also the purple comes out 5 times darker.. ok though 
27246 Can t beat the price. 
27247 Still got to test it more. It charged fully and seem to be running well. 
27248 The Teleconverter worked fine in my Canon. I did not realized that it would not automatically focus if the lens being used has a 5.6 apert.; but otherwise, focusing manualy is fine. 
27249 Calvin the tech was great. VERY KNOWLEDGABLE AND COURTEOUS He knew where to go and did things the other techs did not do! 
27250 all good thanks .. 
27251 These binoculars are very lightweight and easy to carry around. The visual clarity is much better than the older cheaper and much heavier ones we have. I am impressed with the view and focus. These are well worth the price 
27252 Bought this for my grand daughter to go along with her pink camera. Looked ALL over on line and in stores for a camera case with some design on it in pink. Very hard to find...well, this is perfect. She LOVED it. The colors pop and looks great. 
27253 works flawlessly 
27254 Super awesome and sturdy. 
27255 Perfect replacement for original charger. Additional batteries an extra plus. Packaging was excellent. 
27256 Simple, but works great for what i needed. 
27257 Good value, all parts seemed well made and fit well on my Go-Pro. More than I will ever use. 
27258 Works on the FZ-1000. Bright light that allows you to dim/brighten as needed. Excellent product so far. 
27259 Great item 
27260 Very good ball head IMO, especially the price. 
27261 Plug and Play with enough information to fly your Multicopter with TV Display or Goggles. 
27262 Great lens shoot very well! 
27263 Died after being used for 5 photos. 
27264 I love this unit it works great 
27265 Brand new and arrived quickly. 
27266 Great for taking vibration free photographs and time exposures. Although the release can t take timed photos, it is able to be locked open for long exposures with manual timing. 
27267 Great! 
27268 Moves way too fast for practically any video usage. If someone can show us how to slow it down I would probably give it a better rating, but as it is, it is pretty useless. 
27269 Good for the price. They lag a little bit connecting and they blow threw non rechargeable batteries. But easy to set up and use. 
27270 The display worked well but the remote controller did not work. 
27271 Very well made protection for my Manfrotto tripod.I use it all the time. 
27272 It was a perfect fit for my camera. 
27273 good so far. 
27274 Great upgrade for my old Q-see system! 
27275 Works as advertised and alot easier to install than the reglar cloth straps that comes standard with the cameras 
27276 One of the best out there. 
27277 Good job 
27278 nice pics cheap 
27279 Glad we purchased. A great addition to our gear. 
27280 Thank you thank you thank you thank you. Canon lenses + Sony body = happiness 
27281 fits perfect on the screen of my camera! 
27282 it is fun! 
27283 Great price. Works well. 
27284 Fast Shipping. Bought for our Daughter and she LOVES it. 
27285 Performed brilliantly. Got some nice pictures in the pool. Will be taking it snorkel I got next. 
27286 Good 
27287 Very fast shipping and very happy with it. 
27288 There okay, use them here and there.... 
27289 Effortless set-up and pack-up of all of these type screens. Saves a Lot of time for chromakey, etc. Recommended. They used to come in a really nice zippered heavy-duty blue case with handles, which itself could be put to use as a small Blue screen. 
27290 Great! 
27291 Poor quality, selfie connections did not work,returned you get what you pay for !! 
27292 2 out of 3 of mine don t lock to the lens properly. When you get the good one it stays that way. 
27293 As good as the real thing! 
27294 Great filters! They work really well, I love the look they give. The case to hold the filters is great quality as well. Would definitely buy these again in different lens sizes. 
27295 It did not fit my lens 
27296 Great 
27297 So far so good within a few days of attaching it to my Sony RX100 IV. Fits well, and changes the handle of the camera - in a better way. It adds a secure feel in handling the camera. Definitely a must have. 
27298 Cool 
27299 Bought this for my trip to Oahu, Hawaii. Real life saver. Not a drop got it. Floats in the water. Super convenient to store phones and wallets. Will probably buy one or two more as gifts! Great purchase, happy customer. 
27300 Exactly what we needed. 
27301 Still going strong since 2007 after hundreds of cycles. 
27302 The legs are extremely thin and unstable. 
27303 I cannot love this thing enough. For the price this thing is amazing. Can pull up live feed anywhere you have internet or a cell data signal. My friends always ask where I got it and how much it was. They can never believe how cheap they are. 
27304 The quality of the camera is outstanding. Never worry about it anymore. 
27305 I pulled it brand new from the amazon box, and the zipper sticks horribly! I kept it because I needed it for a trip, but very unhappy about it. 
27306 Great price 
27307 I love it!! thank you so so much! it works just perfectly 
27308 As advertised 
27309 Very easy to install and operate. I like it!! I also liked the price. It s a much better system than the one I ve had for years and couldn t operate. 
27310 Great protection! 
27311 Great item 
27312 Gift for my wife. Great product, prompt delivery. 
27313 Works good 
27314 Good one 
27315 FITS MY GIRL S COMPACT CAMERA PERFECTLY 
27316 It is great, but, am waiting for the camera to use this kit 
27317 Work as expected 
27318 Good picture, just as good as the expensive name brand cables. Well worth the price 
27319 Stopped working after couple months 
27320 Exactly what I needed 
27321 I have been a D.P. for 21 years....this far exceeded my expectations...if you don t need a large head to carry a big camera....this is amazing...not only just for the money...but I have heads worth 5X as much...this one really works well....paired with their carbon fiber legs....great 
27322 Great camera bag. 
27323 Charged as expected. Took a couple of hours. But the battery didn t last that long in Camera and battery life didn t show up on screen. 
27324 Excelente! 
27325 good camera 
27326 I liked the product, and had no trouble with the purchase. thank YoU! 
27327 Great quality for what I paid. I use it more than I thought I would. 
27328 works great photos in green shallow waters and glass lens is both a great protector for lens and scratch resistant. 
27329 Works and functions as expected. The downside is that the software is compatible with old operating systems like Windows 7. 
27330 Great product, good price! 
27331 This is just perfect!!! Nicely package and looks great. I will post a picture soon of what my cakes look with it and without it to show the major differences. I use it for cakes but it will also work well with jewelry or pretty much anything 
27332 They work pretty well and compare to the original batteries, so far no problems. 
27333 Meets my expectations fully 
27334 nice filters 
27335 item does not fit requested refund. Have not received approval. 
27336 dropped a 8mm fisheye that did not catch the holster. Needs padding inside the belt where the metal housings are. Lots of bruising. In the future I think I will combine one side with the Spider and one side with the Black Rapid strap. 
27337 Good ring light, bright LED s, good xenon flash as well, but as others have noted, it s difficult to get the light to stay on any given lens. 
27338 Can t get enough of this thing! I love the 4k quality and recently used it in a neighborhood cleanup effort in Detroit. The time-lapse feature is probably my favorite. It is very impressive. 
27339 As described 
27340 Great battery, great value! 
27341 Nice bag and fits a good ammount of gear. Only problem is it s a bit tight to zip and can get stuck 
27342 Great lens at a great price. I bought it used, but whoever owned it took great care and it s basically like new for a fraction of the price. Thank you! 
27343 Works phenomenally. Haven t had any issues with it fitting inside my camera. Would recommend 
27344 A must have for portrait photography! Clean Sharp images with beautiful bokeh. 
27345 works even better than the original that came with the camera 
27346 Loved having all of these back up camera batteries. 
27347 They sent me the wrong color, instead of white it s red... didn t know that there would be no sound when zooming in or out. Other than that everything works okay. 
27348 I am very pleased with it. Best thing I ve bought in a long while. 
27349 No significant drop-off from Canon batteries. Great to have replacements at inexpensive prices. 
27350 [[VIDEOID:9c439f3b04874cf69db357b20ad3fe9d]] My videos are typically short and sweet, but this product demanded a more lengthy video. I hope you enjoy it. I received this unit gratis in exchange for an honest review. 
27351 Great backpack for Camera equipment 
27352 Works fantastic , very good for the money , I am very happy 
27353 Thanks! 
27354 Good price. 
27355 Comes with everything I need 
27356 One word,amazing! ! 
27357 Awesome 
27358 remote won t work on canon t5i as advertised. Tripod is okay, you pay for what you get. not the best but decent for the price. 
27359 Batteries currently last about 5 hours per charge, far beyond my old camera. Only time will tell how they will hold up, but so far they are great. 
27360 A great lens!! 
27361 Works as expected 
27362 Battery did not fit in my camera. Had to throw away the product. 
27363 Great item. I ve used it for a while and had great video taken from this thing! 
27364 Very easy setup. Very useful in lighting up dark areas. I installed it next to my back door in garage. No more trying to find the keyhole. Very bright!! Motion sensor perfect 
27365 love these batteries and charger...I ve got several... 
27366 Beautiful pictures with this lens 
27367 This rig is dope! Don t set it up like dude had it in his video. Camera should be behind the handles. Also buy one of these to offset the shoulder pad. Way better if you plan on using a view finder. Sick rig for sure! 
27368 well packed and everything needed to use with the sony camera 
27369 awesome product great price would buy again 
27370 [[VIDEOID:e4369a1019f77856e8979118bb9ab375]] 
27371 Great product, it fit on any bag, no matter if it is a messenger or backpack.... I fit a Sony A6000 with 3 lenses.... recommended. 
27372 It was delivered quickly, it fit exactly what I wanted and for a finale they included a great (gratis) microfiber cloth. They even followed up with an e-mail requesting feedback. 
27373 didn t work for me 
27374 Lens cap does not fit once the lens hood is installed on 16-50mm kit lens for Sony A6000. Hotshoe cover does not fit either for my Sony A6000 ILCE. 
27375 Works good with my new Panasonic DMC-ZS50K camera. Pocket is good enough for a couple of extra batteries, and design is good. Seems to be built well. Zips easy. 
27376 A nice case to keep additional items such as an extra battery and/or memory card with your camera. The interior is soft and won t scratch your camera. My only problem is the Velcro and nylon strap material can/will snag most 100% polyester shirts. 
27377 Great camera in all respects 
27378 Not 900 tvl as advertised or atleast I got shipped 2 800 tvl cameras ? 
27379 I have not yet used the car charger but the home wall charger does what it needs to do and I am totally satisfied. Price was right, it charges the Nikon CoolPix camera I picked up on the cheap. Now I just need a proper USB cable. 
27380 Amazing. Lots of fun with this little camera. 
27381 battery works great 
27382 ok 
27383 I needed a spare for traveling. It works perfectly for my needs. 
27384 Nice kit and nicer price! Everything fits perfctly with my gopro. Delivered on time. Use the gopro screw insted of the one provided, it get oxid after first use. 
27385 Honestly don t know why anybody would get another tripod. Best bang for you buck. Granted it isn t as smooth in motion as the top of the line. But for those that need a ball head tripod this is the best. Solid construction and will last a long time! 
27386 Nice, you can see edges of the lens hood. 
27387 pain in the ass to use 
27388 This has a European style plug and you ll have to spend at least $5 more for an adapter in order to use it. 
27389 Good 
27390 This scope comes with a tripod and an eye attachment. Very good accessories and scope for the price. I have used this scope to look at stars and the moon, very pleased! 
27391 It good 
27392 The rave reviews of these binoculars are all right on the money. These are fantastic optics for the price. 
27393 Great charger, never had a problem with it. The travel and D cell kit comes in handy. Will be buying the higher end model next time and use this for travel. 
27394 works as expected 
27395 Using them for my twitch stream, they do exactly what I need them too. Seem sturdy enough for my use. Would not recommend using them outside. 
27396 Thank you very much. The shipping was really fast. I love the camera. It is the perfect camera for pictures and vlogging. 
27397 Pre-cut compartments that fits the GoPro PERFECTLY! Handy case to store all the go pro products while protecting it! Boyfriend loves it! 
27398 😊 
27399 It has a very clear picture during the day and the night feature is very cool. Never knew so many animals are running around at night. 
27400 Was really expediant on shipping , but this is not a minolta lens its an olympus OM. Should have done his research before posting .... but hey for $15 the oem hard shell case Is worth it sux I cant use the lens though. 
27401 I purchased this item,it did not work properly. I sent for a refund, i ended up losing 126. in restocking fee all because their equipment did not function correctly, very unhappy. I will never buy from this again..... I give zero star rating 
27402 Look professional. 
27403 Great quality at a great price …works perfect …good suction on the suction cup!! 
27404 My daugher loves this case for her point and shoot camera, especially the extra memory card slot. 
27405 works well. charges well. 
27406 No issues, works as intended. 
27407 ok 
27408 Great camera! Great price! Good response for my questions! Very happy with delivery! 
27409 Very clean, used body. have been pleased with the camera and fast shipping. 
27410 Best camera gadget I have ever purchased! 
27411 I tried one of these with a 76 MZ-5 and Canon 1dx. It did not work in TTL or ETTL at all. Pretty much just fired full blast all of the time. Could not find a fix so I returned it. 
27412 Could fit the P3 a little better. However, plenty of storage, very nice in general. Good build quality. Suits my needs. 
27413 This case is small & perfect to put in my carry on. It s sturdy construction should protect the camera well. If I have anything to add I ll return after my vacation and update my comment. 
27414 Such a conversation starter even if I m just wearing it. 
27415 be Careful, this unit is super strong. I threw it in my console and forgot about a laptop hard drive I had in there..... let s just say it s clean. Cheap way to wipe your HD! Seriously though, this magnet is ridiculously strong, an it doesn t scratch paint. 
27416 Getting this device to take video is complicated and the instructions are poor. I got the clock set, but have tried twice to get it to take videos. Have not yet succeeded. 
27417 ohh yea have already done some cool time lapse with this baby, and just waiting to experiment with leaving the shutter open for certain periods of time. 
27418 Great product 
27419 Works well to take pictures of rooms! 
27420 For beginner I think I chose the right camera for me more than enough stuff to learn how to use over the next 6 months to a year 
27421 Didn t fit my camera even though I was led to believe it would. 
27422 Cheap, but only of the price. 
27423 i need np-fp50 please 
27424 its like canon 580 ex II...takes bit longer to charge...and it is not recognized by the canon CAMERA...so ettl works partially...example...increase power dont work from camera 
27425 Canon PowerShot SX700 HS Digital Camera 
27426 Wonderful! Amazing for the price. Shipping was slow by Amazon standards but I couldn t be happier with the product. 
27427 Does not stay on well, wish there was a camera store near me. 
27428 Another lemon I brought! It doesn t work with Canon 70D! 
27429 Better than the original charger. 
27430 GR8 Seller, loved my items and received them in record time, can t wait to take some pictures! A+++++ 
27431 Love my flash. I love how it automatically works great with burst shots. 
27432 This is the best deal ever for a non-professional photographer such as myself. 
27433 So much cheaper than buying the GoPro brand accessories! We basically saved hundreds of dollars and they are good quality products. 
27434 Works great! 
27435 You can t go wrong with this one PLUS it came with a car charger and a wall charger with are awesome! Thanks for the extras! Have yet to have to use both batteries on the same shoot with my GoPro. 
27436 delivered promptly, item was as described. charged the two batteries and am ready for a day with my camera. will shop with vendor again. 
27437 I should have gotten this sooner, if you want to get more versatility out of your camera this is completely worth it. Its great for capturing wide landscapes and taking pictures half above water half underwater. 
27438 I just got them and noticed that they drain really fast. (I have the go pro hero 4 silver.) My gut said get the go pro brand but i got cheap. You get what you pay for 
27439 Product as described. Would do business with again in the future. 
27440 Strap is well made but the small strap that go under my armpit is loosen all the time, can t lock it, the plastic buckle is the problem. 
27441 works just as described. only for indoors. not weatherproof but I covered mines with plastic for outside gate. remote works fine from 40ft. 
27442 RETURNED....this is NOT for a Nikon D3100 as it indicates 
27443 It is just a simple box...but GREAT in wet conditions !! 
27444 Great, love it 
27445 This battery has more capacity and lasts longer in my Sony Camera than the original. The price was great, and it arrived very quickly. This is a very good choice for replacement of this camera s battery! Thanks, jon 
27446 Good job 
27447 The padding is nice and thick and the case is light weight. Fits my camera perfectly. 
27448 I have two of these, but his is the one I use. I had a little trouble figuring out how much water to put in to make it neutrally bouyant but it works terrific otherwise! Would highly recommend this! 
27449 all ok 
27450 Very nice 
27451 It fits my Olympus Tough-1 camera perfectly. 
27452 It came fold so it has wrinkles and I roll it to see if it goes away I m waiting to see. Color it nice but I can t use it since it has wrinkles 
27453 Luv my new selfie stick this works much better than other s I ve used. The built in blue tooth switch and rechargeable battery make is very easy and fun to use The Rotating clamp and extended arm make for great angle shot s 
27454 Great product.. 
27455 Very pleased with this product. 
27456 Works great haven t got it wet yet I ll mount it on my racing jet ski this weekend so far really good deal 
27457 Great product! 
27458 It is the same as the original battery and charged and worked just like the original battery. 
27459 Just what I needed. 
27460 Works great. Really easy to setup! 
27461 fun copter to fly easy and stable but the FPV is really bad, see the RC forums for more about this. I recommend DO NOT buy this for FPV you will be disappointed. But for a fun quad to fly this is fun!!! 
27462 Great product! I will be purchasing again. 
27463 Loved what I received but the measurements were off from the description. Did not fit my Olympus. 
27464 This is a superb camera. Does so much for its size. Excellent for low light use! have always loved Canons but had to break away on this one... 
27465 great 
27466 there is no instruction or any package infomation in the package. 
27467 does what it says its gonna do --sometimes the tightening screw comes undone but it has never fallen out 
27468 I m very happy with the batteries!! They arrived quickly and they work great! 
27469 The case for my phone recesses the phone s lens and the lens clip doesn t compensate for it. This makes for a cumbersome removal of the case and I usually don t bother. 
27470 Super Fast Lens, buy it. 
27471 thank you for every thing. It is excellent. 
27472 Fast service, great price and happy customer. 
27473 Product was as advertised. 
27474 It s has only one fail , when not tight all the way it wobbles ... 
27475 decent enough digital camera. You just need to get a rechargeable battery 
27476 Arrived on time and works perfectly. 
27477 I ve received just 1 component. Add is not correct.... or the store trick us .... Do not buy it. 
27478 Fits all equipment but not very comfortable. 
27479 excellent product. 
27480 Good sale 
27481 I received this camera Monday. Extremely excited about taking pictures. I bought film for it as well, opened the camera put the film in and it didn t work. I watched several youtube video and read instructions and still isn t working? What s going on here ? 
27482 Quality was okay. But acceptable for the cost. 
27483 Excellent product and service 
27484 as described, got it fast 
27485 Works fine and cheap. 
27486 My daughter loves the camera. She took it to camp this summer. The picture quality is similar to the old polaroid pictures. The film is a little pricey, but fun. 
27487 Good 
27488 Love this and the convenience!!! Thanks! 
27489 not compatible with our Xfinity system. Returning 
27490 I am totally pleased with the 2 batteries. They arrived quickly and were a very good price. 
27491 Works great, we love it. 
27492 it was fine. just what I expected. 
27493 I ordered this case in the yellow with white dots. It came in the mail-it s the brown one!!! 
27494 Nice product arrived on time 
27495 Great service and product. Loved the ease of installation and helps greatly to see my camera screen in bright sunlight. Very inexpensive protection and photo taking assistance! 
27496 Very bad quality. In a two days one motor died. Bought new and replace. In a week another one died. 
27497 Great product. Exactly what I needed at half the price. 
27498 Good fit and decent build.. 
27499 No directions... Lists my camera, can t figure it out 
27500 The filters are amazing quality for such a low price! Bought them for my wife and she loves them! Fast shipping as well 
27501 Didn t fit the battery that suppsably it fit, didn t find out till the day I needed, 6 months later 
27502 Works really good with my Nikon D5500. I completely recommend this item. 
27503 Very hipster and ideal for a photo bug. 
27504 Was very helpful 
27505 Awful. Something appears to be wrong with the film. All pictures are either under or over exposed or don t turn out at all. Have tried two packs. Prior to this, the camera was working fine. 
27506 could be 2 inches bigger all the way a round 
27507 than it would be perfect 
27508 My father asked for this as a birthday gift. He absolutely loves it and made a point to buy the extra battery and parts to keep it running. 
27509 Instructions are vague at best I have not gotten it to work at all as of yet 
27510 As described. No issues. Fits well onto the diving housing for a hero 4. 
27511 These batteries and charger was just what I was looking for. 
27512 Works with the Sony HX300 well! 
27513 Exactly what I expected. 
27514 Excellent product....fit every need of mine and came when scheduled. :) 
27515 The piece fits my D7100 perfectly but the magnification is virtually unnoticeable compared to the stock eyepiece. 
27516 Worth every penny! 
27517 Great as I expected! 
27518 It s a bright portable light. I would advise getting the li-ion battery & keep a spare set of AAs for backup. It looks weak around the shoe mount so be careful handling it. It s not Nikon or canon! 
27519 love it and easy to use 
27520 excelllent 
27521 Exactly what I expected. 
27522 I didn t believe the non-auto-focus would be an issue, but its a huge issue for me. I m keeping it for rare use but won t use it as much as I had hoped. 
27523 excellent tripod. I am using it with my pochade box. It is stable and works well. I love how small it folds to and fits in my backpack. 
27524 My 13 loves it takes it everywhere! Works great underwater! 
27525 Great product! Love it! 
27526 Just as expected, thank you 
27527 A great blogging/vlogging camera for beginners. 
27528 Very good, quality item.Love it. 
27529 not that great 
27530 Excellent!!! Full of room for all your gear!!! 
27531 cool... wish more came with the package 
27532 I bought this selfie crap it broke at the base where my hand hold the grip this is not a well made product don t buy it not worth it! 
27533 Shipped quickly, as described 
27534 My very first DSLR Camera...easy & fun to use & I can take better shots now. 
27535 Great price works better than expected 
27536 These cameras perform ok for what you pay. I know there are better options for color, clarity and resolution. This cameras does its job ok for such a low price tag. 
27537 They worked pretty good. 
27538 I would give this battery 3.5 if it was available. My Sony battery being very old still charges up to 235 min. This battery gets up to 190 min and discharges to 10 min of charge in about 80 min. But as a spare battery it could work. 
27539 Better than extensions not as short of a space to get your subject in focus. 
27540 Works! 
27541 Noticed some color fringing in the corner of some images. 
27542 I;ve been using this for about a year now. It was easy to set up, great picture and nice to see outside where there are no windows. Just added two more cameras. 
27543 Very nice present for my son. 
27544 holds all my camera and lens 
27545 Great case. This will easily protect our camera 
27546 very good for the price 
27547 Gift for my husband - he was very happy with this gift! 
27548 Telephoto did not work with my camera. Seller was prompt to make adjustment. Not happy with the product, but happy with the service. 
27549 Worked great, very happy we did not need to by a new tripod! 
27550 Can t use my camera without this... 
27551 I don t understand how this product has such good ratings. Almost every joint in the box did not fit with my gopro hero 4 housing (see the attached photo). There were a few exceptions, but I wanted a bundle, not a few working items. 
27552 Son in law was happy 
27553 Broke in 2 days. Not worth using 
27554 Perfect for camping flash light. 
27555 This came in a different color, but it s cute anyways. 
27556 Nice. 
27557 Great price and worked great for my nikon d40 plus lens, battery charger cables and more! 
27558 Very happy...very inexpensive replacement for the Nikon. 
27559 Very nicly made holds alot. Canvas looks good and it is a nicr quality bag 
27560 great! replaced the one I broke that I loved. 
27561 Added nothing special lighting wise 
27562 I have yet to get a bad Think Tank product despite many orders and many years. It does what it promises and does it well. 
27563 Love this little camera 
27564 Great stuff and on time 
27565 Great pole, easy to extend, gives me comfort we won t lose our GoPro while jetski-ing. Have purchased another, as a gift. 
27566 This product is identical to two others that I bought for about $4 each on Amazon. On all three the ball joints loosened up after 2 or 3 uses and it can t be used after that. Don t bother. 
27567 This strap worked exactly as advertised, and it works great because it allows freedom of movement rather than having the camera sit at chest level. The clasp is very secure and well done. Very happy with it 
27568 Good 
27569 Looks and feels like high quality leather.......probably because it IS high quality leather. Fits the Sony RX100M III perfectly. Leather, adjustable shoulder strap. Would like to see a small pouch on the back side for a small lens clothe. 
27570 Perfect! 
27571 Great Product!! 
27572 Great Product and Excellent Quality. 
27573 I like it,it does its job with ease. 
27574 misleading 
27575 It works and matche dmy len. Pinch caps are the best. 
27576 fits perfect with my camera 
27577 sturdy and comfortable:) Love the cute designs and the attractive color ^^ 
27578 This is a extremely useful dolly and I love using it when shooting shallow depth of field. 
27579 perfect 
27580 It is exactly as described. I would deal with this supplier again 
27581 As advertised and fast delivery. 
27582 Customer support is fabulous. Worked on my issue and continued until problem was fixed. 
27583 Not near as cushy or comfortable as I had hoped. Looks nice but just doesn t have enough padding. 
27584 Very beautiful bag 
27585 a gift 
27586 Delivery was fast and it works great. Some of the accessories were not worth having but the package is still a good value for the beginner. 
27587 Fits my nikon d5200 perfectly. Cute and sturdy. 
27588 Love it! 
27589 Good product so far, 
27590 Super replacement. Highly recommend!! 
27591 Pretty flimsy when extended. Can t support the weight of the go pro and will spin around. 
27592 nice set 
27593 I recommend anyone beginner or expert to own one. Can t go wrong for the price. Overall a great camera. 
27594 Works great! Still on my first protector 18 months later! 
27595 The CD with the software is full of viruses, detected in different PC running Symantec and McAffee, could not yet find the software to download from the realand.com website. So far useless. 
27596 Great Lens for travel and walking around. The focal range means you can shoot up close or wide without changing lenses. The pictures I get are tack sharp. Great lens at a great price. 
27597 use all the time-it works perfect so I always have backup when I m out on the road taking shots 
27598 great! 
27599 Great little lens for beginners to try macro photography. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of shots. Give it a try. 
27600 It s pretty sweet! I used it last week when I went diving and its great especially with the variety of lengths you can choose from! I like that it had a padded bag and parts to connect my camera too! 
27601 First one died after 10-15 pictures. Amazon was great and sent a new one and I returned the old. New refurb unit has worked very well for what it is, a point and shoot camera. I like the wifi capability and it works well with my IPhone 6plus. 
27602 It converts nicely, but I wish the screen was a little bit larger, so I could see what I needed to adjust. 
27603 Bulky 
27604 Good 
27605 Henry was very helpful to fix my modem issues. Camera works great Thank you 
27606 It works perfectly! Your only problem will be to change the battery as it is hard to pop open the port. Other than that an excellent product. 
27607 Works great. 
27608 great for my a6000 
27609 I purchased this camera as a gift for my son. His remark about the camera was &#34;awesome!&#34; The camera takes great photos and the zoom is amazing! May purchase one for myself! 
27610 Excellent Camera and an excellent package and price 
27611 Got the job done! 
27612 Very positvive this battery. In perfect status. 
27613 Great product for the price. the Lense cap was bit tight for my Nikon camera but it works fine. Will certainly buy from this seller again. 
27614 Looks good. Sent back bc i don t have internet 
27615 Henry Campbell is the best. So helpful! 
27616 Zipper jammed, and I destroyed the zipper trying to fixed that..... 
27617 It s listed to fit the Fujifilm X-T1 but doesn t. 
27618 great seller - delivered as promised! 
27619 I just wanted some easy to use quickly lens, and these are perfect.They are good if you are on holiday and want to take some nice shots or if you have some pictures planned. Especially good with the iPhone 5s as it has the very good camera quality! 
27620 Works perfectly. Safe, secure and attractive. The elastic function around the lens acts much better than the typical through-the-eyelet keepers 
27621 Thank you! 
27622 Perfect for what we need them for. 
27623 Arrived on time. Fits the charger and the camera as promised. Arrived with a greater charge than the battery provided with the camera. 
27624 Batteries are a bit larger. Tight fit 
27625 Excellent package 
27626 NONE 
27627 Love these things. I wish they were cheaper because I need 3 more. 
27628 GREAT PRICE,FAST SHIPPING, I BOUGHT THREE OF THEM. 
27629 Excelente 
27630 Pretty tinny cloths 
27631 I had to return these cameras due to the terrible connection to our wifi. The image quality was nowhere near 720p. I ended up purchasing a hardwired security camera set that works better. Save your money on this product 
27632 thx 
27633 was my husbands birthday present for his gopro. he loves it we carry it everywhere. 
27634 Excellent product. I use this for my spotting scope at the range. This allows for easy fine adjustment at extreme distances. Very intuitive. 
27635 Good for what I payed for it. 
27636 The battery was only $7 including shipping. Has quite a bit more milliamp capacity than the original. Made a great replacement battery. 
27637 GOOD DEAL 
27638 Complete garbage 
27639 great. 
27640 I purchased this shutter release for my Nikon D3300. the button on this release has a tendency of getting stuck and if you have your camera set to bulb mode this may lead to over exposure. I d recommend looking for something of better quality 
27641 Awesome camera for family! Super intelligent mode, a lot of scenarios and effect for more professional look. And also fully manual mode for more professional job. 
27642 most disappointing,worked for one day, total lack of support,phone calls were endless loop,emails returned.sending it back will be another irritation. 
27643 great product thank you 
27644 These are made pretty well, very happy. 
27645 works great easy to use 
27646 A LITTLE HEAVY, BUT IN THE TOOL BOX. 
27647 We bought these for a trip to Aruba...I was concerned about the quality of picture it would take but was pleasantly surprised that the underwater pictures turned out great!! Also, they were available at the gift shops on the beach for $22.00 EACH!! 
27648 The stick extensor is a little flimsy not for any major X-sports ,just casual pics all else as expected 
27649 Cheap, comes dirty, scratched up, but what can you expect for a cheap Copy Stand. Definitely got the job done though. 4 star because it came beat up. 
27650 This cute tripod does just what it should. The iPhone is held firmly in placen no wobbles. And I love the remote shudder control. I would purchase from this company again. 
27651 Super prompt with delivery. 
27652 .great items for on the road photo shoots. 
27653 Works just like it is supposed to. Not sure why the other one died but...... 
27654 very nice 
27655 So adorable, looks like a purse but holds the cutest camera ever. 
27656 Great idea however it does not close completely. It saves time and hassle of removing the &#34;standard issue&#34; lens cap. 
27657 Great buy I love all the features it has, especially transferring photos straight to your iPhone. 
27658 Its a perfect size for my camera. Not too big, but holds everything. Love it! 
27659 A bit difficult to lighn up with the camera lens but other than that works great! 
27660 Love it, best mount I have bought so far. Easy to use and not in the way. It is as if you were riding the bike while watching the video. 
27661 take some getting used to but overall but works great. 
27662 This works well. 
27663 terrible sevice will not refund item keep saying nrver got item 2nd return both item don t work keep away kenneth 
27664 It was exactly what we need and it came with a string that connects the lens to the camera to prevent loss of the cap in the future. 
27665 Fast shipping !!! Had Everything my Boyfriend wanted. Great price 
27666 Works as expected. Nothing fantastic but allows for a lot more use than the tiny battery. 
27667 I am extremely pleased with my Sony DSC-RX100M III Cyber-shot Digital Camera and its accessories. 
27668 love it 
27669 Great! Wow I love it. 
27670 These radio triggers are simple, rugged and reliable. I use them for weddings, location and studio work. I especially love that I don t have to deal with cords anymore! 
27671 I does not work properly and need to return Garbage 
27672 Very pretty colors inside the film. We liked the transition from one pictures Frame to the next 
27673 Very good 
27674 This camera was a birthday gift for my husband, who takes pictures of things like Venus and birds a quarter of a mile away and continues to be amazed at the picture quality and features. Best gift ever according to him! 
27675 good 
27676 Quick service. Everything arrived as expected! 
27677 Great service and great product!! I could not be happier and am having lots of fun playing with my new toy. Thanks so much 
27678 It s so hard to press the button on the stick don t buy this buy a selfie stick with seperate camera button to take the picture. 
27679 works wonderful as a white black and gray refinance i would recommend this to any photographer from hobbyist to professional 
27680 Only one worked. The other never worked at all. Shortly after I received the package (2 weeks) the second battery stop working. Not worth the buy even for a short period of time. 
27681 Great System , easy to set up. 
27682 Works, big and bulky 
27683 good 
27684 Performed as expected. I like the way it folds to a compact size. Seems to be made well and for the price, it is a great product!! 
27685 Thanks! 
27686 Didn t stick well to my kayak at all. 
27687 it suks and thay all broke after 2 days 
27688 good size! 
27689 Came as ordered. Looks slightly different than the one I was replacing, but works the same, and fits the same! 
27690 So pretty~ suitable with nikkon coolpix p900.. And color is amazing...... 
27691 Simply perfect. Works great, Provides protection and does it s job well. 
27692 Too big, too wrinkly, doesn t come with stand. 
27693 I needed the extra length cable to go under the eaves of the house from the furthest point. Had a little left over at the DVR but no problem. The camera worked perfectly. 
27694 Great little camera 
27695 Item was as described and arrived on time 
27696 Buen producto 
27697 The screw is a little long. Did not fit my application. Quality is better than expected. Have to return however. 
27698 small, efficient, and the hot shoe can be unscrewed so it can be mounted on a threaded screw. 
27699 Perfect fit.. 
27700 Great set of lenses, inexpensive, and they definitely do the trick without spending a fortune. 
27701 My friend recommended this camera to me. She said she likes this model over the newer model. I don t know the difference, but I sure love this model. It s user friendly and works great, indoors and out. 
27702 will see if I need it 
27703 Go seemless or go home. I switched from canvas this and wow. Editing is a breeze now, and if there is a mess tear off the sheet and pull more down. 
27704 Useless if you d like to shoot anything at a down angle. Works ok straight on, but if you attach it to something and point it down at an angle, the top just starts drooping down. It can t hold the position. So, kinda pointless.... 
27705 The batteries are working great. 
27706 works great 
27707 Does not work looks very odd way 2 big took forever to come. 
27708 I needed the battery charger and it was a much better price than what was at a local store. I was pleasantly surprised to receive so much more than just the charger. 
27709 Great camera! 
27710 It was a great addition to my go pro! very easy to use! 
27711 Plastic fantastic. 
27712 Nice to have a bunch of these lying around. In the desk, in the backpack, in the car, with my sunglasses. Keep our screens and glasses clean without scratching! 
27713 Good 
27714 Easy to use. Did a good job of converting 35mm slides to digital. 
27715 The camera filled up with water 5 minutes into the snorkel trip. 
27716 My tapes get stuck in the door while trying to remove them. Have to jiggle them vigorously, then they can be removed. 
27717 Works perefext. 
27718 Thank you, it was exactly what I needed. 
27719 aaaaa 
27720 This camera is great! It s sooo cool and cute. And really easy to operate. The directions and manual answer almost ever question you could have. I LOVE it!! 
27721 nice product 
27722 Brilliant!!! Great customer support...completely intuitive to use. 
27723 simple to use with great outcomes 
27724 very good 
27725 Product is not compatible with Polaroid Zip Printer. I only get &#34;Paper Mismatch&#34; error. 
27726 I flew great then about the 5th flight it broke. Took it to hobby show they said it came with a burnt out motor. 
27727 Very nice set for the price. I am new to digital photography, and these filters are very helpful. They arrived in good condition, well-packaged, and I am pleased with the purchase. 
27728 Great item! 
27729 Amazing lens!! Very good quality and it s affordable! 
27730 incredible camera. 
27731 Love the bag but would like a little more room 
27732 It works, but there is no real way to get it tight because of the elastic. It bounces mad moves a lot if you have it set on the top mount making the video almost unusable. 
27733 This is an excellent clip. It stayed on my backpack shoulder strap was easy to adjust and went all over Europe shooting video constantly. 
27734 Got this a deal of the day for a great price. Its one of the best sling bags I have used. 
27735 Very durable product. Withstands a great deal of intensity using the product. 
27736 I want to love these, they are good, but if anything knocks them over, the umbrella boning bends so easy! My other issue is if you can t attach a reciever and use the umbrellas. I had to buy a new attachment that allows me to use it. 
27737 Great little-power house of a camera. Looking to add other glass on the camera. 
27738 Works great, love it! 
27739 Good resolution 
27740 All good. Thanks! 
27741 Only after using it once, the battery door broke. 
27742 Love it 
27743 Excellent! 
27744 great compact bag you will appreciate during travel 
27745 When used with various Lowepro bags and their utility belt, this is a great way to distribute weight and reduce the strain on my shoulders (already an issue with two Nikon DSLRs). 
27746 The Internal Foam is not useful. Size doesn t fit the GoPro well. 
27747 The item was delivered earlier than expected. The quality of the product isn t the greatest but works as expected. 
27748 I was very satisfied to see that this replacement was exactly the same as the one I lost. 
27749 it came with everything promised and it works great 
27750 The filters have internal mounting treads and are for a Polaroid. They will not work. My Minolta AF200M Zoom 28 - 100 needs filters with external treads, 55mm for may D7 Maxxum; which is what I ordered for. I will never us Amazon again for my photographic needs... 
27751 This item was exactly what I needed and came right on time. It arrived the day before my trip, which couldn t have been more perfect. -TD These are The Last Days of Dark. 
27752 simply amazing. not the best in low light. but when it performs it is the best in it s class. 
27753 Great product for price. Easy installation easy to save data 
27754 Excellent quality for price 
27755 Just What I Needed. 
27756 Hard to use and didn t work for what I needed it to do. Not good unless you are working outside in wide open environments. 
27757 Excellent! 
27758 techhelpla.com approved 
27759 Good 
27760 This glasses is good I love it 
27761 I use this all the time. My Go Pro is always hooked to this! 
27762 I like the fact that it tightens well and doesn t move from your desired setting. Lots of applications and options with this. I will buy a few more. 
27763 No disappointments. It does exactly what the product description says it does. The only consideration is that it is, as advertised, &#34;light weight&#34;. As long as you handle it with attention that doesn t seem to be a problem. It s certainly worth the price. 
27764 The batteries get hot. Not so good 
27765 Bought for the wife and she loves it. 
27766 I haven t used it much yet but it doesn t seem to polarize as much as I hoped for. 
27767 I am soooo happy to get this and it works wonders, Thank You! 
27768 Very good product. Good price especially compared to the Nikon model. Fast delivery. 
27769 Flimsy. Can t hold my Canon 6d. 
27770 Perfect fit to Yi Sport. Charges quite fast. Haven t check how long it lasts but will update the review once done. 
27771 Some different precut compartments than shown in the picture. As a newbie not vital for me, as I m trying to figure out what I need/want, but if you re buying this for exactly what s shown, you may end up returning it. 
27772 Nice set! Everything here is usable and quality product. I would have liked a better case to store it all in together. Glad to see such a combo set available. 
27773 Good 
27774 Works like it suppose to! 
27775 Compared to the pricier monopods like Manrottos, this one seems a good bit smaller in size, which might be good. It s sturdy enough, and great for the cost. 
27776 It is a great bag, but way too small for any dslr camera and lens kit. I should have listened to the other reviewers. Now I am stuck with it or buy a bigger bag and lose the money I spent on it 
27777 Works as expected 
27778 1 star because 0 is not an option. This is not compatible with a sony A230 
27779 The product is good, but does not fit in my speedlight. I´ve just bought because of recomendations who bought together. 
27780 Easy to install and use. The longest part was the camera installation. ..running the wires through the attic and into the On Q panel. 
27781 really nice I got it to use for police harassment that s right!!! I recommend it for anyone who is being harassed imagine for the people who are supposed to protect you. But sadly its the truth. God help this new America. 
27782 Nice little case that goes well with my new Nikon mirrorless camera. 
27783 This thing will only provide power to the camcorder. It will NOT charge the battery. The red light blinks as if the battery were being charged, but it s visual trickery ! No charge in the battery, regardless of how many hours it is left plugged into the wall. 
27784 Worked great. No leaks. 
27785 Good 
27786 I love this background. Great for packing, stretches well and for this reason no wrinkles. Recommended. 
27787 Works exactly as described. Somewhat slow on auto focus, but other reviews mention that. Very pleased for the price 
27788 Good quality, simple product, easy to use. Does the job well, no setup involved. 
27789 The photos appear too light. I tried several times to adjust the setting, however; the photos still remain too light. The same photos were installed on another name brand, and they look beautiful. My wife and I are not happy with our Micca purchase. 
27790 Great charger at a good price 
27791 I recommend, fast delivery. very good 
27792 Works 
27793 It s super gucci i love it it makes my pictures look gr8 
27794 Uncomfortable to use... 
27795 work great. 
27796 works great thanks 
27797 Just Great! 
27798 It was horrible and does not work. The film turns blue.... Do not purchase this film. 
27799 Great extension to my cannon camera. 
27800 These little inexpensive triggers work killer. Great purchase. Will be buying a couple more 
27801 Could not get it to work on iPhone or ipad 
27802 The insert for the pole was no issue. The problem was that it was somewhat transparent and I had a client ask me if it was a sheet from my bed. Not professional. 
27803 Very lightweight and easily tilts over...overall a good value tho...lightweight and decent quality 
27804 Works good. 
27805 Just what I needed for my new Nikon D7100 
27806 Camera is just as described and works fine 
27807 Excellent 
27808 Camera mounts are standard 1/4-20. I use the suction mount on my kayak (with safety line), plenty of holding power so far. the helmet camera straps are basically useless, I had to replace them with the pull to tighten kind. Everything is great otherwise 
27809 This drone was outstanding! I could preform flips and fly very high. The drone does not handle wind very well, and is currently stuck in a tree. 
27810 It s great I bought this for mountain biking and it has held up through many bumps and some crashes and records great and stays tight. 
27811 Great price for quality videos. Easy to use. On time delivery. 
27812 Love it 
27813 Works great, and the extra dry storage is a bonus. 
27814 Glad you offer this plan. 
27815 Materials expected to feel better 
27816 Very adjustable. Easily get a perfect and comfortable fit. Mountain biking videos are much more interesting from this perspective vs. a handlebar mount. For $13, this is an absolute steal. Quality is very good. Stop looking and just buy this now. You won t regret it. 
27817 Good condition! 
27818 This filter was delivered SCRATCHED. Not just slightly scratched--it looked as if it had been scraped along concrete. Not exactly what you want to put on the end of your camera lens. THE WORST product I ve ever purchased online. 
27819 Good buy 
27820 Excellent for the money 
27821 Have never had a problem with Hoya. It works as it should. 
27822 Worked great! Used it for whitewater and climbing! Adjustable and Seems to have more adjustability than the gopro brand chesty mount. Love the blue also, makes it pop! 
27823 I hope not use it. but none one knows it. 
27824 YAAASSSS 
27825 This is a heavy duty case great for demos! 
27826 Worth the price. Maybe 
27827 These are nice 
27828 This was just what they say it is. I like this because it blocks the sun from hitting the camera so that you can see the shot a whole lot better. Great when shooting from a tripod. I love it.... 
27829 Great experience with purchase and a great camera. 
27830 I like it. seems sturdy, easy to use, bluethooth connect intantly. will recommend this product to a friend. 
27831 This was the recommended size. It did not fit my lens 
27832 good 
27833 .works but a little too heavy 
27834 Excellent product for the price. 
27835 Delivered on time and fit my camcorder just fine. 
27836 I absolutely love this camera! It came with a handy strap and color of the item was true to description. Item was brand new and packaged really well. It takes great shots however just be aware that there s only 10 film per cartridge (not included in purchase). 
27837 Excellent product 
27838 Extremely small and lightweight das good. However, it pops off its rotating ball far too easy and does not support the weight of a point and shoot camera. Also what if this &#34;free gift?&#34; There was no free gift. Does the plastic bag count? 
27839 Great product! 
27840 Perfect, during night has a good view 
27841 Good adapter 
27842 Good! 
27843 Simple, plain, to the point, fast 
27844 Nice product so far. I ve been having it for a week now and I have no problem with it. 
27845 excellent very pleased 
27846 Not a bad purchase. It is a bit light and I wish the lens were thicker. 
27847 But now it don t work ! 
27848 Very nice. We got them to clean DVDs but staff all wanted one for their glasses, too! 
27849 Everything worked perfectly 
27850 Great filter... 
27851 Works great. Love having the extra power. 
27852 looks very good outside! very real 
27853 I matched this mount with a gorilla-pod tripod holder, and it works great not only for holding photographs, but for holding phones on headrests for in-car video. 
27854 Great item 
27855 This kit is exactly what I was looking for and needed. Set-up is easy. I know I ll get a lot of use out of this product. Should this not be durable, I ll be sure and let you know. Thanks! 
27856 Good for the price. 
27857 Bought his for my Canon Tebel T3i Does what it s supposed to! What else do you want? Charges perfectly, no issues. LED light indicates when charging is done. It s compact, no wires. Pins flip out to plug into socket. Very happy with my purchase. 
27858 This bag is the perfect size, not too small but super lightweight and easy to carry all your stuff in. 
27859 NICE product 
27860 Great product. Better than all other baby specific monitors. Will buy again. 
27861 IT S the best very BRIGHT strobe flash. 
27862 Very average photo s phone in a bag is better 
27863 Well made. Does what it s supposed to do, and will last. 
27864 Fantastic camera. Cannot tell you anything about the vide as I am a photographer and did not get this camera for video. 
27865 Nowhere near as large as described. I returned it since I could not get the gear stashed that was described. 
27866 Charger works great, and will definitely purchase another one in the near future. 
27867 Very good!! 
27868 Works well for the moon. 
27869 light, portable, works great 
27870 Takes a bit of trial and error adjusting the setting, and maybe a few film sacrifices. Other than that great camera. 
27871 The cameras have great video when connected directly to the NVR... unfortunately we could not get them to work wirelessly with my existing wireless network. Tech support responded but could not follow their instructions. The manufacture needs to provide a LOT better and understandable instructions. 
27872 great value 
27873 Richard 
27874 They really look like active cameras. 
27875 Could not get this to work with my Canon T5i. Sent it back for canon model. 
27876 a 
27877 great camera for the money 
27878 nice but not very durable 
27879 Can t beat the performance for the price. 
27880 Awesome lights 
27881 This is one of the best deals for this product! 
27882 Easy to install and look real. 
27883 I love this bag! So happy I bought it!. Its nice and big and I love the color. Great buy! 
27884 Lasts longer and charges faster than OEM battery. Using with a Sony AS-100V action cam. Update 5/30/2016: Do not leave the charger or car adapter in direct sunlight. It will straight up melt. If you leave it in your car cover it up with something. 
27885 Simple but nice product 
27886 A camera made for dummies like me. I love the zoom feature. And I like not having to carry a supply of batteries with me. 
27887 It s film and it works. What else can I say? 
27888 Great product and works like a charm.. 
27889 got a couple of these, i don t know if it deterred and burglar but so far no break in yet. 
27890 Does not last as long as I thought it would. 
27891 I have taken more pictures and not have to watch my batteries...Ready for my curse. 
27892 As Described, recommend 
27893 This strap works well with the camera I have. 
27894 easy to set up. 
27895 I m a beginner, very happy with this stabilizer. It took me minutes to balance it 
27896 I love it and wish I still had it. I had to through it away because the top fell off while I was running away from a lightning storm. Anyway, it was great but not durable but I didn t expect it to be for that price. 
27897 I really like this camera. It takes really nice pictures, including panoramic and other features. Only complaint is it goes through a lot of batteries. I suggest getting rechargeable batteries if you buy this camera. 
27898 I lost my lens cap. This one works. Not a whole lot to say about it. 
27899 Fits my DJI phantom 3 pro camera like a glove. Easy and quick to install. Not ackward and cumbersome as the camera stabilizer that came with the phantom. 
27900 As advertised; delivery on time. 
27901 Fit perfectly and great price.Could not find locally. Was glad to find on Amazon 
27902 doesnt fit my sony alpha. not sure what ass backwards connection i was given. dont waste your time! 
27903 Excellent !! 
27904 Good Price. Works as expected. 
27905 What is there to say? .... It seems sturdy for an important modern need. 
27906 Great flash bracket, simple an reliable. I will probably replace some of the knobs with something all metal and then these will be as good as expensive manfrotto brackets. 
27907 As soon as it arrived I opened it and it was completely scratched on both ends I don t know if they don t put much effort into making these or if I got a used one. Totally dissatisfied 
27908 too flimsy, needs to be stiffer 
27909 Works perfect! 
27910 Good product, but the resolution could be better. 
27911 It never worked. I should have sent it back. 
27912 Amazing 
27913 Simple to use and with the included pocket on the gel holder, the gels will not get lost and last a long time. It s also easy to cut your own gels out of material found at Office Depot. The gel holder fits perfectly. 
27914 This works great for taking photos for my online store. The light does suck up batteries so be prepared with some extras. 
27915 Happy to have the extra protection. 
27916 Works great! 
27917 Bad ball head for heavier cameras. 
27918 high priced for a dolly that barely holds up my dslr. Next time I will shop around. 
27919 nice 
27920 This is a nice case. Its vintage and can be used for more than just your camera. 
27921 Works as stated. 
27922 Excelent. 
27923 Captures stunning video. This is my first GoPro so I m still figuring stuff out, but man is this thing fun to play with. Easy to take ANYWHERE and capture most anything you do. Touch screen is a nice, new feature. 
27924 Really great picture and package, especially for the price. Took it under water just fine, love it. 
27925 Not very liked. It doesn t allow for quick access to the camera and you can t take a quick photo. Protects very well though. 
27926 Product quickly re-charged my camera & the extra cleaning kit had everything I needed to take care of my equipment. Thanks you. 
27927 I am so happy I bought this, I used it for the first time and it was wonderful. So easy to change the screens. the size is also nice and can be used as a backdrop. 
27928 Excellent product. A+++++ 
27929 It s a more comfortable alternative to cheap cord straps. It rides about mid-chest on me, which is what I like because whatever is on it doesn t swish around as much when it s mounted higher. 
27930 Good Deal! 
27931 Awesome original part, in oem package and from slicktron rc, got it first class mail in 2 days, wish I had know would have ordered all parts from them! 
27932 works great! 
27933 MagicFiber works great for me so far. No lint or fiber material left on the surface of my sunglasses or laptop screen during or after cleaning. I use one of the oversize MagicFiber sheets to polish and wax my guns. 
27934 Great product and Service. Walter in support was very helpful in setting up my remote access 
27935 Poor quality, and not costly for what is delivered. Poor quality eyepiece optic focal adjustment. 
27936 fits fine 
27937 Excelent and original piece for my old Minolta 100-300 mm Xi lens!!! 
27938 Love it! 
27939 simple and easy to use 
27940 Absolutely perfect for my needs. 
27941 Connections drop when used for a while, battery seems to go dead but actually experincing loose connections 
27942 There was no way to choose the color I wanted. I ended up getting gray and white even though the orange was displayed. 
27943 I bought this one little a year ago and now it is dead. 
27944 It s ok!!!! 
27945 Works great. Easy to use and easy to transfer photos to computer. 
27946 Works great and easy to set up is you re familiar with CCTV DVR S. 
27947 not as cool as i spect 
27948 Exactly as described. Great quality paper! 
27949 Smooth transaction. Fast shipping. A+++. Thanks!!! 
27950 I ordered this item and I must I say I love the design of it as well as the construction. Definitely well built and durable all the way around. I will be combining with other accessories such as the vest and belt but so far its working great!! 
27951 Came with a few extra little things that I can hang my pictures with, and a nice little note. Very lovely people! 
27952 The pics are clear and it has plenty of options. I was a little disappointed but 360 view in a half sphere is pretty neat. It s a fun little toy. 
27953 pretty cheap and ugly but works ok 
27954 works 
27955 I like having extra batteries on hand for my camera and the fact that this was a 2-pack was better yet! 
27956 I love this bag! Perfect size for the camera and everything that goes with it! Received on time and in great condition! 
27957 Works better then the original battery. I purchased six of them. So Happy. 
27958 I needed it for a micro sized projector.. It works but not without some effort 
27959 Works ok for family stuff, but not reliable enough for professional work. It s freezes my camera now and then and the only way to fix it is to take the camera battery out. 
27960 Looks good. Have not used it yet. I does not have any decals. 
27961 Light and very adjustable. Nice to have the level bubble. 
27962 Converting to a monopod the 1st time was a little tricky but I got it to work. Product is exactly what I wanted and is a nice size so I can travel with it and set it up quickly. 
27963 Item arrived broken. I was required to pay for the shipping back. 
27964 Love these flashes. I use them with the Yungnuo 560 triggers and I couldn t be happier. 
27965 Takes a nice picture, but has awful focusing issues. 
27966 Very nice product lasts longer than the one provided by Nikon 
27967 Good product has a rubber liner on he inside that works great 
27968 Works for my wife, price is good, thanks! 
27969 Very Good 
27970 Received the case and it fits the Samsung camera quite well. This case is going back as it s not made of leather at all. If you want a plastic case buy this one. 
27971 High quality images using my Canon 70D. Incredible sharpness. High quality construction, feels very solid, great feel to the focus and aperture rings (fully manual) beautiful appearance as well (love the giant front element). 
27972 My experience with this item was not good, as the performance was way below expectation. 
27973 Cute and quaint. A role of film is about 20$. 
27974 Neither device would trigger the flash no matter what setting the camera was set on. 
27975 Excellent looks very real 
27976 Geat replacement screen. Will look great once i put it on my old gameboy color. Great product. A++ seller 
27977 Works great, and at a great price! 
27978 Such a great camera for beginners especially! Easy to use while still producing quality photos and videos. 
27979 Looks real enoughat a distance. 
27980 Simply awesome. Charges my 18650 batteries very quickly. 
27981 This did exactly what it said it would do, and seems to be pretty solid construction. It doesn t feel like a lightweight piece of junk. Some things like this feel like really cheap plastic, but this one does not. 
27982 Works perfect it was a gift for my girlfriends mom and she loves it takes it fishing camping to the beach always gets it wet and it does perfectly fine 
27983 Great battery. I bought two extra ones when I purchased the Q500+ which gave me four batteries and ensures me at least 1-3/4 hours of flight time on breezy days and up to 2-1/4 hours on calm days. 
27984 Nice items. Just as spected 
27985 just what i expected. and it is simple to use 
27986 Works great! But I would recommend getting a better GoPro pole. But 1 problem I always open the case upside down:) so you need to mark the top. 
27987 These work pretty good. I use the smaller ones for my old binoculars and one of the bigger ones for my range scope and they fit and fold down just fine. Easy to stretch and fit! 
27988 The battery works great,also I m using it in my battery grip for my d60 Nikon and it works flawless 
27989 The rings seems to be dropping colors on the box itself. Not sure will it drop further? 
27990 Great mount and allows me to position the camera in a multitude of ways with ease. Deducting one star because the one I received was only able to go side to side, not the side to side and front to back as pictured. 
27991 Very nice bag, it works perfectly with my Zipshot MINI. Please note it will not fit the larger Zipshot tripods. 
27992 The moving(swivel parts) make the camera rattle around to much. 
27993 Excelente 
27994 Great 
27995 all good ingredients. very help first. 
27996 I got my moneys worth,keepup the good work. 
27997 Had to return the first one due to communication problems between the remote and the drone. They promptly sent me a new one. I was pleased with that. Other than a few technical glitches, I am enjoying the DJI Phantom 3. 
27998 camera is great, accessories not that good 
27999 Perfect for a new YouTuber like myself! 
28000 it is okay and good 
28001 Great quality. 
28002 !!!!**** Fits the Fujinon XT17 x 4.5BRMK14 lens for a Panasonic HPX 370 
28003 Good 
28004 Where are all these 5 stars coming from? These cloths leave more lint behind that what they remove! Or I must be extremly picky but Im not happy. Others work better do more research. 
28005 Performs as presented ,great camera for long trips. 
28006 Inexpensive and lets me keep my go pro going all day at the track. 
28007 Everything was shipped and came on time, but the quality of the items were horrible. Everything that had to do with the lens (hood and attachments) did not fit the camera at all. The tripod is cheap quality as well. I am pretty disappointed by the turnout. 
28008 Easy and fun camera to use for the price. 
28009 great for the price. 
28010 Cheap, works as expected 
28011 works better than I thought it would. Beats paying hundreds for a Coolscan. 
28012 Great product and the quality of the pi8ctures are great 
28013 Good 
28014 Nice camera! 
28015 No instructions but easy to figure out. Great product, great shipping. 
28016 It is OK, but I am not blown away with the quality. I guess you get what you pay for. The shoulder holder is definitely not the best part on this rig. 31/2 star. 
28017 Great, works as anticipated.. Only wish it were a tad cheaper. 
28018 Good product, works great. Like the separate packaging, Threw a couple in each glove box for my glasses. 
28019 Used this on an adventure course near Lake George. Worked great. Was worried it would stay on throughout the rough course. The little grippies worked fine. Glad I purchased this 
28020 COOL!! 
28021 nice light...at a very inexpensive price...you get what you pay for though...the stands are cheap...and the light hoods don t collapse for easy travel. But still a lot for a little. 
28022 Well made and strong, sturdy but unfortunately the shape of the handle bars prevent it from fitting good so cant see the phone but still a good product. 
28023 Great Cameras... Best for reliability if you need to do remote monitoring of your house. 
28024 Great case! 
28025 Great way to organize the stuff I have for the pelican case. 
28026 Arrived on time as described. I installed it and had my alarm system back up and running. 
28027 This item was a gift for my daughter. She said to give this a 5 star rating ! Very pleased ! 
28028 It s a little heavier than the one I have at home. You can only use this MANUALLY. Other than that, I thought it was okay. Add in a diffuser, and you re good to go. 
28029 This worked our perfect for my T3i!! 
28030 I am very pleased with the product and the service. 
28031 It is a lot of fun for the money. 
28032 Love this lens, clear pics and f/2.8 makes it great in low light! 
28033 Yes! I used this to go on ZIPLINE with a video camera. I used both straps connected to one camera for certainty of control. Worked Great! I removed one of the Metal screw on camera bases, and just used the lockable hook of one of the straps. 
28034 It was great until the waterproof aspect failed and we had no luck getting a warranty replacement, as &#34;Kodak&#34; does not really make this product. 
28035 I love it!!!! 
28036 Will keep your GoPro from sinking to the bottom of the lake or ocean. Worth the price for peace of mind. 
28037 I ve had this camera for a long time and have never had a problem with it. Great purchase 
28038 Pretty nice lens for the money......you have to run it in manual mode but once you play around with f stops and shutter it s pretty nice. It even took nice pictures of the moon. Very satisfied 
28039 Very Good Tripod for price! 
28040 You would think this would be a no-brainer, but despite following the poorly-translated directions, I haven t been able to make it work yet. I think its simply defective. 
28041 Great training drone, easy to fly. Small enough for indoor use. It can really take a beating. You will need additional batteries for a good flying experience, the batteries last 7-10 minutes per charge. 
28042 Puts light right where you need it... 
28043 No comment. 
28044 amazing customer support, excellent product at a great price! Support from AR004216 was incredible! 
28045 Accessories are great. I had hoped the case had a permanent insert designed for the Go-Pro but it was just a foam insert that falls out and slides around too easily. Still a great deal. 
28046 Fits phone. Arrived promptly. Only difference is my original one had foam and was slightly more comfortable. 
28047 I ve owned this product for a little more than 6 months and used it for roughly 10 shoots: It has been finicky for the last two shoots, causing one to be cut short, and has now stopped working all together. Don t waste your money on this garbage. 
28048 Question: I have taken pictures inside and outside, close and far away, most come out blurry. It has the smart auto and smart flash settings on. I am not knowledgeable about cameras which is why i bought one with the auto features. Am i doing something obviously wrong? 
28049 could do without the rubber in the middle of the view finder 
28050 Nice, rugged little bag. Tight fit for my Canon PowerShot D30, but OK. Would hesitate to put more stuff in the bag, such as SD cards or cables. Several options to carry: neck/shoulder/wrist strap or belt clip. 
28051 This tripod mount works really well. Would have benefited from instructions on how to put it together but I eventually figured it out. 
28052 Really don t think you can find a better tripod for cheaper! Bought it (and a binocular adapter) for use with my astronomy binoculars and I couldn t be more pleased. 
28053 Great professional stuff. 25+ years in the alarm business, but don t do it for a living anymore. I swear by it, 
28054 Wow! This is one of the cutest and best deals. You get everything in the picture and they re all super cute. Can t wait to use it. Packaging was nice and arrived sooner than I thought. I highly recommend this deal. :D 
28055 I bought this product for some tabletop product photography. I needed a white, seamless background and diffuse light. This product worked great, especially for the price! I paid $20 and would happily do so again. 
28056 The camera was exactly as promised and i have loved it immensely. It was a good price for the camera, and it has been rewarding to me. 
28057 Great deal. Far exceeded my expectations. Great starter if you re really interested in photography. 
28058 Excellent product , really improves vision in bright sunlight. 
28059 Does the job. Great price. No issues here! 
28060 No life at all. Went dead with in an hour of use... 
28061 Awesome 
28062 Works as advertised 
28063 Just stopped working 
28064 This is not the described pink I was expecting. Although the color is more a salmon/coral shade, it is OK. 
28065 The camera is excellent, and the package included tons of things that made a great choice. 
28066 The camera is long gone, but the case is indispensable. 
28067 Like the camera, once I got it set up. It however took me 10 hours to set up a website and set up router. I am not tech say, had to watch YouTube to get it done. 
28068 It is affordable and works as intended. Might need a bath when you first get it, but not a big deal. I would order it again. 
28069 It works as it should. 
28070 It takes wonderful photos. Frustrated that I can t get the movie button to work (that means no shooting video). 
28071 One of the best camera bags I have ever owned :) 
28072 Well made, easy to use 
28073 works very well 
28074 Works well if you know what to do with it....LOL so really cant say. But looks nice and installs easly. 
28075 lots of storage 
28076 Great thanks🌸🌸🌸 
28077 RECEIVED IN SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. WOULD RECOMMENED 
28078 I filled mine with heavy cat litter inserted into ziplock bags first. 3-6 pounds on each side does the job. 
28079 ♡ 
28080 Love it. Very easy. 
28081 All parts were in orders. Nice small camera for travel. Easy installation and download. 
28082 A versatile lens with great glass. I use this lens for everything from portraits to landscapes and have no complaints about its performance. Only praise. On the pricey side, but you get results. 
28083 A little too small 
28084 great 
28085 Only thing wrong is it is a little wiggly but it stays close to zero all the time 
28086 Great quality, fast shipping. Performs as needed and appears to be of solid construction. The first float I had, the stitching came apart where the camera hooks to the float. A lot of good that does to save your camera from sinking.Float held my Nikon perfectly. 
28087 Thank you the batteries and charge, perfect for my camerar. It will give me additional time to take pictures. Now, I will need an SD card with extra storage. 
28088 I lost the original hot shoe cover on my Olympus OM-D E-M1 and purchased this as a replacement which fits perfectly. Since is made of rubber, it has not accidentally fallen off. 
28089 It was really great at first but one trip to the beach got it rusting pretty bad. 
28090 I was very surprised at how easy and simple it was to use. It keeps the great quality of pictures. 
28091 A nice kit for your DSLR. Filters really make a difference in the quality of your work, and also protect your lens at the same time. This is a very reasonably priced kit. 
28092 Firmware is not updating over internet.. Certain albums are not displaying. Is there an option to update software by USB or SD card?? 
28093 Works perfectly! Don t waste hundreds in an electronic viewer. This is actually better! 
28094 Would not work!! Would not connect!! We put it to the side and forgot to send it back!! Never used!! 
28095 Exactly fit! And very good quality and fast shipping! 
28096 I really don t know what to say, it came in and the part that you screw on to the mono-pod was broken, never did get any answer back from vendor, but it gets you out there to the subject your trying to get a pic of.... 
28097 Works great. Cheap enough I bought several. 
28098 I was hoping to soften my image a bit, but this just blurs beyond recognition like an 1980s mall photographer. Also its coming from Hong Kong so too forever to get here. 
28099 Love this Magnifying Loupe. Had been thinking of buying it for a long time and finally saw a price I could afford. The transaction was easy peasy and the seller was great...no issues....def recommend both this seller and the item. 
28100 good 
28101 Excelent cam !! 
28102 Spot on! 
28103 does what is expected, good product. 
28104 Neat little softbox for the price. Nothing incredibly but definitely better than using the naked flash. 
28105 Works great for everyday photos 
28106 Small, adjustable, great picture and sound. Built in microphone has good range and helps eliminate cable clutter. Easy to disconnect to avoid hackers who would use your camera to spy on you. 
28107 Have only used one of the batteries, but for one cycle it seemed to match the performance level of the Canon battery. 
28108 Is exactly as stated and works great. 
28109 Outstanding little camera system with many features. A great value for all you get. Mobile viewing was very easy to set up and the picture quality is good. Too many walls will shorten the distance of reception however the system is outstanding in all. 
28110 Does what it says and now I don t have to buy separate filters and hoods for different size lenses! 
28111 very good I love it. 
28112 Not what I tought it would be 
28113 great price 
28114 I bought these small binoculars for my Sister who likes to watch birds from her kitchen table! She said they work perfect! She uses them every day! 
28115 A+ 
28116 yes just what i needed 
28117 Great little camera and DVR system, very easy to set up. 
28118 Fits the GoPro well! 
28119 Makes a big difference in the overall appearance of the camera. It works very well and cost a fraction of the Canon battery grip. 
28120 As described and good quality case. 
28121 Everything it was said to be! 
28122 I combined this with http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VV7JMSC/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=1OABL0D3PBHIE&coliid=IGQJXE3GB584V for a wonderfully complete kit for under $100. The only thing I need now is a quadcopter... ;) 
28123 Perfect fit for my Pentax K50 And all the little things to hit the trails 
28124 The material is quite good but the smell of the leather is so strong ... this makes me feel uncomfortable. 
28125 Good tool 
28126 Best BIG umbrella i ve ever used, and the quality of the rods and fabric are well above average. The parabolic dome shape makes a big difference in light control. I threw a 7 Impact diffuser on it to soften the flash even more. Looking forward to shooting this weekend. 
28127 sturdy and easy to adjust 
28128 A must have for humid climates. 
28129 works great 
28130 im happy i will put sam pic or video later 
28131 Great case, perfectly fit my needs and priced right too. Arrived on time. 
28132 Solid construction. Packaged well. Performs as advertised. 
28133 Same charger that Canon ships with the camera. Lost mine. Canon wanted 50 bucks for the replacement charger. nuff said. 
28134 good 
28135 Beautiful strap BUT you better have a small hand. Difficult to get my hand through the loop and I don t have especially large hands. It s a 5 inch loop, needs to be 6 inches. 
28136 Just received my gopro today and no sd card but i choose the package with sd card :(((((( 
28137 good product 
28138 I love this. I was expecting something smaller and it s huge! You definitely need to have a place for this telescope. It is a very sturdy telescope. I haven t gotten to use it yet but can t wait 
28139 Excellent!! 
28140 The lens is amazing! BUT, I just bought this specific package because the lens hood like in the photo. When I opened I was very annoyed as they are not as described. HOW CAN WE SOLVE THIS PROBLEM??? 
28141 camera record in AVI only which is not compatible with 90% of the devices out there. I recommend buying the Wi-Fi version if you would like to actually see your videos. 
28142 Works well as a basic, every day lens and fits my close up lens set for use in flower photography. Nice addition to my camera bag. 
28143 works as described 
28144 My first review was rejected because it was very emotional, well, I will say easier, the device does not work as claimed, I did everything according to the instructions spent more than 3 hours making the one and same action and the result is zero does not work! 
28145 just what I wanted, real nice screen to see 
28146 My camera and all my lenses fit beautifully in this case. I love the fact that I can just grab it and go. 
28147 for the money ok but lots of plastic will fatigue ecome britle and break over time Im sure. More cheap junk from China. 
28148 Great for low light and quick photos. We use it take photos inside mostly and it works wonderfully. With just the little bit of light that makes it into the room from outside, we are able to take fantastic photos that look like they were taken with great lighting. 
28149 Def awesome does it all 
28150 They work great with both my 60d and the 70d. 
28151 Broke after one month. Need to return for one that works but is past return period. Motor just clicks but does not move. 
28152 Works great! 
28153 Exactly what I was looking for 
28154 Cannot beat the price on this and goes with my little vintage style polaroid perfectly! 
28155 ok 
28156 One battery was ok, but the other looked 20 years old. So swollen, it wouldn t fit in the compartment. 
28157 Love it! The retractable design makes it easy to carry. The brush is soft and it does the job very well. You must have one if you love your camera lens. 
28158 The lens hood work effectively and fits the lens correctly. 
28159 Product was useless, and the installation took almost an hour with cable Internet, as fast as it could be, I am still not able to set this camera, the My D-link was pain to find the product. 
28160 Please read comment By jnunniv on April 23, 2015. He is 100% correct. I followed his advice and, just as he said it would, it &#34;works like a charm.&#34; 
28161 ok 
28162 Soft, Gel-feel that you can keep on for hours. Camo is a plus too 
28163 So far so good 
28164 Worth the money. Don t see much difference I m GoPro brand with length of battery life 
28165 great 
28166 Fast shipping, great price! 
28167 Good Stuff 
28168 It does the job it s supposed to do. 
28169 [[VIDEOID:6cdee2e305bf59b79ec48101e10270a9]] I have reviewed the Ambient Weather BC-3000 intelligent battery charger and highly recommend the product if you are looking for an all in one battery charger for your home or business. 
28170 This is the greatest drone ever. It takes great pictures and videos. I am very happy with its easiness to fly. Definitely an A+ rating. 
28171 My cell phone takes better pictures, and my cell phone takes awful pictures. 
28172 With 1) a sensor battery life of only 6 months, compared to a Honeywell system of 3 years, 2) No-one that wants to monitor the system. makes this system not very realistic for an alarm system. Spend a little more money and buy a real system. 
28173 remarkable range and reach that most users will come to love. The main reason why I fell in love with it. 
28174 Like the way it brings out the blue of the sky. Awesome Poduct. 
28175 Only half of the picture was color. The other half was black. So much for &#34;rainbow&#34;. This was a birthday gift for my girlfriend... never been so disappointed. 
28176 Cute film, awesome colors. 
28177 perfect 
28178 little small but really protects lens 
28179 Very impressed with the clarity and quality of this film. Looks as good as digital but with the character of film... Nuff said ;-) 
28180 WASTE OF MONEY! 
28181 The quality of the video is fantastic. The microphone for sound is very sensitive to wind noise making the audio during the ride completely useless. 
28182 all ok 
28183 Works great, decent video quality and easy to set up 
28184 Too heavy. 
28185 One of three arrived torn. Extra material on the back is great if you need a sun screen, but a pain in the tail to deal with. Likely will cut excess material off. Just not worth it. 
28186 worth the money for clarity 
28187 Exactly what I expected 
28188 Love it, just love it. Simple to install, connect & configure. 
28189 Worked as expected 
28190 I got the 720p , picture very clear, infare red cool, its like having alight on, visiability only around 30 ft at night. Set up was easy, the only real work is running cable, which has label s, so you can t mess up. we love it! 
28191 My Camera is amazing...Maybe a bit overpriced but nevertheless it was worth it. 
28192 It s made out of plastic,the unlock bottom is flimsy I m afraid it might get stuck in the long run. 
28193 Nice easy to fly toy quadcopter. Great for first timers - like the blue color, I have 3 white ones that I have flown to death. 
28194 Just what I was looking for 
28195 just so so,it is tiring to change the camera lens 
28196 Excelent 
28197 The camera was more than I expected. Pretty much brand new with instructions. Completely satisfied with my purchase and this seller. 
28198 The battery was the correct battery for my camera and is working fine. Walt 
28199 Takes forever to focus whenever you zoom in and the picture will often come out blurry even when it indicates it s focused. Constantly made loud static sounds in the background of videos. Returned it the same week. 
28200 Did what it supposed to do 
28201 These batteries work beautifully in my Canon EOS Rebel XS. They hold a charge as well as name brand. I got them so I would have plenty of backup batteries on hand and I am so very glad I did. I will definitely buy them again! 
28202 I am very happy with the product... Customer service at amazon is the best... Thank you. 
28203 usefull to put all the elements of your camera. easy to open and get everything you need 
28204 We love our new camera. It took amazing photos of our Smoky Mountain vacation! 
28205 We like this camera but it is not doing everything it is supposed to do. It looks like there is some software glitch along the way. 
28206 How could you not like these. Five reasons to say thank you. 
28207 I bought this based on some of the reviews, one of the review s was a video review and what I got was not the same thing in the review s. I returned it. Later I read some of the other folks had the same problem. 
28208 Great for extending cables without have to splice new ones in. 
28209 I miss read their ad, but they stepped up and helped me out. 
28210 Great product thank you. 
28211 Great service Calvin! Camera works well after help from support. They were very responsive. 
28212 great little webcam. 
28213 Love this backpack. It even has a nice compartment for my netbook. Thank you! 
28214 fake gopro product with bad quality cheaply made chinese goods 
28215 The video not clear. The sound is bad and nosy. The detect move notification is late. It is realy useless 
28216 seems to work well 
28217 The lens has it s limitations, but if you know what you are buying it for, it s a great lens for the price. I absolutely love it. 
28218 good strap arrived on time 
28219 never worked as described 
28220 did not work with my altura flash. no problem with refund. 
28221 Works as advertised, no issues! 
28222 Excelent Product, Use to carrier a Video Camera (Handycam). 
28223 fast shipping, as described. 
28224 it is a good product, it is too small, though. 
28225 fits well 
28226 I love this tripod. Its is very strong and has a lot of features. I strongly recommend it, you wont regret it. 
28227 Love them and they came on time!! 
28228 It is perfect. My identical camera had broken and this is completely like my old one. I love it and it was packaged beautifully 
28229 The orange tabs did break, I bought a bag of 24 clamps from Home Depot (various sizes) for a better value. 
28230 Holds my DSLR well and protects it 
28231 Great product--leads to fun memories. 
28232 Great set of filter. They truly add contrast and detail to photos. The case is really good quality as well. 
28233 Product as described!! 
28234 Excellent product. Multi-element achromatic design provides very high IQ compared to single element close up lenses. Adds flexibility to large aperture zoom or single focal length lenses. 
28235 This is a great value !! We love it 
28236 Very sturdy and great quality 
28237 excellent 
28238 Amazing product definitely not a fake I highly recommend it. No problems with delivery or the product itself. Comes with a lot of accessories ! Love it ! 
28239 Better than original go pro batteries. 
28240 The first one I had was great, but i lost it. The second one for some reason the top keeps falling off. 
28241 delivered as advertised very reputible. 
28242 Better than Expected! 
28243 Ok 
28244 Amazing quality for such a small lens. I love it. 
28245 Auto focus does not work with my Sony, but it is not a big problem. This lens lets you get some really interesting shots and people are amazed. 
28246 Wow! I truly love this camera body protector. It was just what I needed for my new canon 6D camera. It fits like a glove and it s also very light weight. I truly recommend this product to anyone. Protect your high end purchased. 
28247 excellent! 
28248 excelent , no problem 
28249 Very good product though a little costly. 
28250 This was a gift.. Never asked how it went.. 
28251 It does what I needed it to do. 
28252 Great binoculars for the price. I would recommend using a tripod for astronomical viewing. 
28253 I have owned several of these for various camera models. I have even bought them as gifts. I have never been disappointed. 
28254 Great product, great details. Not very clear description. The product is not a touch screen. 
28255 I LOVE THIS CAMERA. Stepped up from a Rebel T3i (which I love and still use as a backup body). Love the speed and the low light ability. Great pro-sumer camera. Wifi addition is tremendous and allows me to use my iPhone as a remote. Love it. 
28256 so far it work good. the only issue is that it won t start recording automatically when power is inserted which is important as I keep forgetting to turn on. 
28257 It s too hard to get an item under it to see anything. Can t really use it for the reason I purchased it. 
28258 This perfectly fit my needs. Love it! 
28259 love it 
28260 My product arrived just in time for my trip. I was able to use the covers to protect my lens. I am very happy with them. 
28261 The quality isn t GREAT, but it does OK. 
28262 I m using these as weather cams on wunderground.com. They handle FTP posting well. Directions are clear and easy to understand. 
28263 Great lens, probably not quite as sharp as the Nikon 14-24 but getting really close. 
28264 love it. works great and the accesories have exceeded expectations. 
28265 Does NOT fit the updated versions! 
28266 not working. I followed the instructions and it wont work. 
28267 Perfect fit. Love it. 
28268 Loved it...wish Flip was still in business. 
28269 Ordered for cousin 
28270 Very good value for money. All the components were good quality and worked perfectly. Will be buying a second kit for another camera. 
28271 Works great. I m only giving it 4 stars because it s aftermarket, and not canon brand. But hey- it s works great, so far!! 
28272 Good👍 
28273 No problems. Works as advertised. 
28274 This was a gift so I haven t used it, my granddaughter loves it. 
28275 Good 
28276 Works fine 
28277 NONE 
28278 It works, does the job, not big improvement on using time 
28279 LOVE it!!! Exactly what I need and use all the time...outstanding quality! 
28280 Not really that helpful but does have many functions spelled out. 
28281 Purchase was easy and product arrived on time and worked fine 
28282 Works as expected 
28283 Works perfectly and seamlessly with my 5D MkIII and my flashes. Exactly what I expected being another great Phottix product. They really are excellent! I would definitely buy again but doubt I ll ever need too! 
28284 Easy setup and good replacement for my Izon 1.0 - now i have a night vision - great. 
28285 Awesome loved go pro type this video to see it in action 
28286 Henry Campbell did a nice job helping me get my camera up and running again after moving. He remoted in and fixed it within 5 minute. Thanks, Henry. 
28287 Had to return however, did not fit my camera. 
28288 There is no info about camera on internet. Camera works well, but there are no infareds so no night vision and i can not figure how the usd cards works 
28289 Only way to connect is third party app that does not explain anything. 
28290 resistente 
28291 Works great. The people that posted negative reviews just don t know how to use this. Don t set on max setting and manually prefocus if you have to, or set at lowest setting, auto focus and only then adjust ND ring. 
28292 Works great for cell phones, quickly charges and can recharge a cell phone many times between charges. 
28293 The tripod works great. It came very fast. This tripod does what it is supposed to. Great for its price. The travel case, however, came defective and the material is not good quality. 
28294 Worked great. Batteries corroded when left inside though. 
28295 Good 
28296 Crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap 
28297 Generally good, but focus is erratic and sometimes you get poor pics. 
28298 Easy to use, glad to have it while being on our tropical trip (boating, fishing, snorkeling)! 
28299 Great kit, the pad is nice and the belt is easier than putting on your own belt. 
28300 was used and missing the brkts for attachement. besides that it won t just fine 
28301 works great easy to set up 
28302 Easy to install and it works very well. Best price you can find online. 
28303 This plate is an exact match for my Ravelli APGL3 tripod. 
28304 Once I started using these for location shoots, I ll never stop. I absolutely love the results with my speedlite. 
28305 Shipped a large fragile and valuable sculpture in this. Pelican products are simply the best - built like a tank and flawless quality and design of every detail - clasps, wheels and handle are all outstanding. Not cheap but you will never regret having any of these cases. 
28306 tHE CAMERA LOOKS GREAT BUT MY GRANDAUGHTER HAS NOT USED IT YET. I THOUGHT FILM FOR THE CAMERA WAS IN THE &#34;BUNDLE&#34; & SHE NEVER SAW IT. AM I MISTAKEN/? BARBARA K MC CORMICK 
28307 Love it 
28308 I receieved the first one it did not work at all. Then the second one I rec d only one side of the charger works. It appears that the terminals inside are very poorly attached and just fall loose from shipping. Quality is very poor. 
28309 good product, price and company. 
28310 As other reviewers have stated the cloth does leave excess lint behind. 
28311 My Phantom2 is awesome!! Easy to fly without any experience! 
28312 Good quality 
28313 keeps the neighbor from parking in my driveway when i m gone. 
28314 Very good and useful to use the telescope out of city. 
28315 Works great. 
28316 So much stuff for a really great price! It came just in time, tomorrow I have a ghost investigation so gonna try it out !! 
28317 Works great,no probs yet,I m happy. 
28318 These Sony tapes work very well in my Sony Handicam Digital 8 camcorder. Output is in nice, clear video. I have used this camcorder and these tapes to record my grandaughter s birthday party and make an excellent DVD from them. 
28319 Non-standard thread size and ilconcieved proprietary clamp mechanism make this flag too flakey to trust on any shoot. If you have spare room on a cage or rig, lots of time and odd parts maybe. 
28320 Best digital camera on the market, hands down. I ve played with and used almost every brand and functionality out there and this one won my heart. Too expensive. 
28321 Be real careful mounting ,adjusting , the arms-mounts are very delicate , flimsy, once up near my real ones ,they look good, and may not be detected as fake, 
28322 Had sum questions of if it s 1080p but it is a good pictures 
28323 good quality but it s abit big for women wrists 
28324 works flawlessly 
28325 Easy to use durable and reusable. 
28326 Worked well for short period of time and then died. 
28327 Good flash.. delivered as promised.. thanks... 
28328 it is awesome 
28329 Works perfectly great. Seems really solid for anything we d ever need it for. Holds steady and turns smoothly. 
28330 as described good product 
28331 Nice product, all is well 
28332 Nice, but not quite long enough! 
28333 Handy gadget, works great, love the little storage compartment. 
28334 Comfy!! 
28335 dope lens you can t beat an F2.8 plus its made of strong material kinda heavy too which is good 
28336 It s okay. But I find the phone apps to do more! 
28337 Keeps your GoPro from sinking to the bottom of the lake. Covers back door completely. Includes the two tether mounts/anchors, not the surf mount, as depicted in the first photo. 
28338 A lot of fun. Easy to use. However I now want an upgrade. 
28339 Fine product, not sure how good this glass is but it works and my pics look a lot crispier and warm and I get to show the awesome blue Florida and Puerto Rican skies and puffy clouds. 
28340 Arrived with tear at the seam. 
28341 Works just as described! Incredibly simple to set up, and I love the function and aesthetics of it. Will probably add more! 
28342 The camera 📷 works great. 
28343 Got the cord and it doesn t work. I had to buy another one from best buy. 
28344 GReat price great service 
28345 Just as expected...added to my home surveillance, works great. 
28346 Great Product 
28347 Product just as expected, would use seller again. 
28348 I received the items before the target but 3 out of 9 were no working. 
28349 Excellent binos. 
28350 Worked perfect. Used over-sized bulk black paperclips to hold to Cowboy speed light stands and did my first green screen video. Worked perfect. Easy to store between video shoots. 
28351 Gud 
28352 It s okay, some vignetting and the outside is a little soft. I can t really complain because it was $250. I love h the wide angle though. 
28353 I like the 8-in-1 gopro kit, it arived pretty quick. The only thing is that the straps for the chest mount can be a little small if your a big person. All in all cool to have. 
28354 worked well for paint ball mask 
28355 not the right one 
28356 what i needed 
28357 for tus price its a good buy. 
28358 Love this alternative to pocket wizard. been using mine for a year. I have 6 and, they are reliable cheap and easy to use. I found a few youtube videos and had it all figured out from there. 
28359 It is very functional and very well protected. 
28360 This item was a gift for my 15 yr old granddaughter in Texas. She loves it!!! 
28361 excellent! 
28362 This has to be the best camera in the market. Pics are sharp, performs great in low light and with 32MP you can crop like you had a 500mm lens. Lots of options, intuitive to use (for an FX DSLR). 
28363 Nice quality. Good price 
28364 Delivered on time with great packaging. Items were as described and definitely a great asset for my photography! 
28365 Works well 
28366 Good Seller and Product 
28367 Had a few cosmetic issues, but lens seems to be in great working condition. 
28368 This unit works as expected. Great quality, built well with perfect connection to batteries. No longer have to worry about having access to AC power! 
28369 Very fast shipping and very happy with it. 
28370 Great product. 
28371 Garbage, don t waste your money. 
28372 A dream lens on my D700. Big and heavy and built like a tank which may be an issue for some weight wussies out there, but hardly a concern of mine; I appreciate build quality. Very sharp, great contrast and color saturation. 5 stars all the way. 
28373 Legit. Convenient. Easy to use. Smart design. Practical. Follow me on Instagram @heyitstony 
28374 Received this in really fast time, and as pictured. Had to mess with it a bit to get it on, but the extra filters I purchased fit fine. No real complaints. Would purchase again. Thanks. 
28375 Love these Wasabi cells! My GoPro 4 Silver does through a battery pretty quickly. A whole day of photos and videos is about 3 batteries worth. 
28376 This is a great case and perfectly designed for the dji Phantom 2. The drone and all of batteries, chargers, and miscellaneous pieces fits perfectly. It s very well built, lightweight and is what I had hoped for. 
28377 everything was ok. Thank you! 
28378 Good quality 
28379 I pulled it out of the package and plugged it into my wall. I then put a battery in the charger. It charged the battery like it was supposed to, even on off-brand products. Works great! 
28380 Husband likes this case because you can t see in it plus no one knows what it is. He also like it because it s very small. 
28381 RETURNED THAK YOU 
28382 Works so well I had to buy another! lol The picture is very clear and very wide. 
28383 This is definetly a must have product! 
28384 Product arrived deffective, with one loose leg, like there is a missing screw or something. I needed it for my vacations, what a waste of time and money. 
28385 Perfect solution to watch your pets and your loved ones at home. I found out that my dog just sits and waits near the entrance of the apartment from the moment I leave until the moment I come home. Amazing. Almost cried. 
28386 Worked splendidly. 
28387 very good.... 
28388 Awesome camera We took it on an 11 day safari with a six year old and 64 year old Grandmary. Easy to use n awesome shots were taken with the zoom. We took 1084 shots n kept 200. 
28389 Does NOT fit Canon M series. There were two questions on here answered saying that it does. I bought it and can confirm it doesn t fit. 
28390 Great all work fine 
28391 nice quality 
28392 Easy to fit on the handle bar. the actual GoPro holder can be removed from the handlebar holder what leaves a small peg on the handlebar 
28393 It meets my expectations does everything I thought it. Very pleased with the product. 
28394 I loved 
28395 very nice great value , perfect for those quick shots w/o using a slr. 
28396 This adapter is life. Works perfect! 
28397 It was lovely. 
28398 excellent 
28399 The quality is low but you get a lot with the deal. 
28400 good outside bad inside 
28401 Good price compared to battery stores 
28402 thank you 
28403 Works as advertised. I like the charger being independent from the camera. Have not fully cycled the batteries yet but don t expect issues. Also provides 12V. charging. Much cheaper than others. 
28404 takes fantastic pictures, model is a little older now, but cant beat this camera at this price point. Do not hesitate 
28405 Very nice filter set. 
28406 I love this Air Blaster..easy to use...no problems at all... 
28407 Richard. did a great job helping me set up port forwarding as well as email triggering.......10 Stars !! 
28408 My 18 year old and my 13 year old traveled to Toyko Japan and Manila, P.I. for the summer vacation. My teenager daughter got awesome videos using the GoPro while riding the wooden sailboats in the Phillipines. 
28409 great for the price 
28410 Seriousity and fast shipping!! 
28411 Just what I needed! 
28412 This is exactly as described. I bought this as a second battery for my camera and it is better than the original in that it lasts longer. The charger charges both batteries fine. 
28413 Does what its supposed to. 
28414 nicccccce! 
28415 Love it, but two weeks later and I still cannot figure out the instructions for downloading. 
28416 Not what I was expected. Came without any parts or helping page how to use it and how to see your pictures. This is our way to our future. Will be a disaster as planned by the experts in Washington, D.C. 
28417 Used on my panasonic dmc-fz70 camera. Fits perfect and pictures/video are great. Like that it protects the main lens. 
28418 Absolutely perfect, great price! Thanks! 
28419 Does what it is supposed to 
28420 its very good for taking photos but not good for videos. very smooth 
28421 A bit bigger than I expected, but works perfectly. I really like the fact that it can be plugged in directly in case the batteries in the receiver do die. 
28422 nice 
28423 It served the purpose. 
28424 Here s the bottom line: people wave at it as they walk by. :-D 
28425 Batteries are just as good as the original Nikon battery. I really love the travel charger. I keep a spare one in my suit case so I never leave home without one. I highly recommend. Shipped as promise I would purchase from this seller again. 
28426 Excellent Camera, Thanks. 
28427 It s very difficult to get off. It does wok but I wish it was machined better. 
28428 Omly wish it had beewn waterproof. Excellant telephoto and video. 
28429 Fit is very very good. Would buy again. 
28430 Very nice camara 
28431 cool looking 
28432 Awesome purchase!!!! Came in fast and everything is wonderful quality! Def would buy again 
28433 video/audio quality were good. i liked the product until the only button on it broke from pressing lightly. it was useless after that 
28434 works great 
28435 Fits like a glove, keeps out dust and protects the connectors on my a6000 flash shoe. 
28436 does what it is suppose to, and its made of metal. 
28437 Got this for my husband discounted to review. My husband has a canon camera but it didn t fit so he gave it to a friend who has a Sony. The friend says it works well. But the adapter does not work with all canon cameras. 
28438 versatile unit and easily achieved the position i wanted. 
28439 Great camera and the quality of the lenses are out of this world 
28440 Great--fits snugly and makes the camera look better, too 
28441 Works well. Cracked easily when dropped and now doesn t float well. 
28442 Everything perfect! Thanks! 
28443 You ll look a little silly with it since it s so huge but your camera will stay dry. 
28444 Takes clear pics. Great video! Small, portable, and powerful. 
28445 Amazingly sharp cutting wheel that will trim such a small sliver of paper from a photo if I didn t position it correctly the first time I cut it. Love that! 
28446 Nice polarizer, nice price! 
28447 They didn t work on my Kindle 7. 
28448 Excellent product.. it helps me a lot since I m new with my camera so I use it a lot... for me it s perfect to have more than one battery to use. Thank you! 
28449 Works great for a fraction of the price of the orion brand. 
28450 Great Camera Bag. Bought one as a gift in 2012 and the bag is still protecting the camera and lenses. 
28451 Exactly what I needed so I m not constantly changing lenses. The &#34;leash&#34; for the lens cap is a sweet bonus. I have &#34;lost&#34; the cap so many times in my travels. Also, the bag is well-padded and perfect for my Nikon and the new lens. 
28452 It s made out of plastic not carbon fiber. While not perfect, it will give some protection. 
28453 The backdrop is exactly how it looks in the seller pictures. Pictures can out looking great. Recommend this item. 
28454 I realy like my new Phantom!!! Thanks 
28455 WORKS GREAT BUT A BIT SLOW TO CHARGE 
28456 Awesome! use as a security alert. 
28457 FANTASTIC UNIT 
28458 This filter is working very well. I ve read where some photographers have had a problem unscrewing a filter (not necessarily this one), so I don t tighten it down all the way as with all of my filters. I m very happy with it. 
28459 bad. very bad. didnt charge my battery. went to a wedding to shoot, popped out the battery, and it hadnt been charged. the design is bad too. the battery easily falls out of the charger. 
28460 Works great but make sure you either carry a tool that will loosen these. They work so well with the gasket that sometimes your hand strength isn t enough. 
28461 it works great.pain in the butt to get set up right but with a home security system you will have that 
28462 Came quickly and as described. Worked perfectly for my Canon Powershot 
28463 Bought for my mother as a birthday gift. She loved it an it s many capabilities.The touch screen makes it very user friendly. Great resolution and IR mode. Very pleased with this product. 
28464 this part finished off my telescope. perfect 
28465 Works great with my 18-135 canon stm 
28466 Purchase inspired by Ken Rockwell review; it s totally awesome for power, compactness, and utility with a consumer-grade D3300. The price was painful, but the product was worth some of that premium. 
28467 Excellent 
28468 Fits my Canon SL1 with standard 18-55mm lens, battery charger, and USB chord. Tight fit. Good compact case. 
28469 Did what it was designed to do. But the product that I used it for (not a Sony product) did not work out. So I sent it back, along with the defective camera. 
28470 It worked great 
28471 Uncomfortable and pointless. You cannot comfortably take image with your hand in this thing with a D3300 
28472 Needed a back up battery, fit the bill nicely. 
28473 as advertised 
28474 I liked the product, and had no trouble with the purchase. thank YoU! 
28475 Thanks 
28476 good complement with the purchase of the quadcopter I recommend this a lot 
28477 Waterproof case doesn t work, water got in and now it doesn t work, never opened. Screen turned greened after 1 use 
28478 Thanks to Joseph badge #AR004204 for the set up help, product works great! 
28479 The case is attractive and compact! Like the feel of it and the utility! 
28480 Couldn t get a picture to show on the screen. Directions very poor. Tried some you- tube video instruction to no avail. Toshiba laptop should work with it but doesn t. Emailed Protensic but never got an answer. Don t know what else to do. 
28481 It s really great, but after some work in events I m not using because it s heavy without the chest acessory. 
28482 5 generic-brand lens covers for for my camera for less than 1/4 the price of one of the name brand. Fantastic! 
28483 Great product just wish the case was a little bigger 
28484 it started to shake. I barely used for 5 times. 
28485 Love it great light great customer service from seller great experience all the way around 
28486 When I was trying to download the firmware files. The wifi from bebop drone keep saying. Impossible to connect. It toke me about 30 mins to download the firmware. :/ 
28487 If I could rate it lower I would. It was a complete waste of money. Worst video quality you could imagine. I should have known better trying to save a buck. 
28488 Works great! Quick delivery. 
28489 They work really good 
28490 I like so much. Yellow bobber is easy to find in the water. 
28491 GREAT DEVICE at an Outstanding Price!!! 
28492 Works well as a monocular... however unfortunately it calls itself night vision. It is not even kinda night vision. 
28493 These have everyone fooled. combined with some legitimate Brinks security yard and window signs, I think this is a decent deterrent. 
28494 Works well... 
28495 I am very satisfied with this purchase. The camera is like new and charges itself, I never need to replace batteries as I had to with the old Coolpix. 
28496 Strong case but makes some of buttons hard to press 
28497 As advertised. 
28498 Great! 
28499 Worked ok but speakers were not very loud for video. 
28500 the fan has a problem, at first everything was fine, now is making a lot of noise 
28501 No problem with them.. 
28502 Excelente 
28503 This filter is remarkably constructed. The build, quality and and overall construction is excellent. It screws on nicely onto the lens and fits snugly. The coating is even and of high quality. Breakthrough Photography really makes great filters for a great value. 
28504 Great product and fast delivery. Look forward to next time 
28505 I ordered this battery for my Nikon D7000 and put it into a grip. Used it for a night time star shoot and had no problems. I ll know how good it is after a few months of use but so far so good! 
28506 I still have this canon camera and still use it for everything! it is so simple if you just like doing simple video and photography. And you can change the way it looks depending on what size lens you buy. 
28507 So far this floating bundle has been great! Easy to use and good qualtiy 
28508 Installer said it was a malfunctioning camera. I had throw packaging away so I did not return and counted as my loss. Discourage as a client for future purchases. 
28509 Bag was too small for my new 3/4 Lumix 
28510 camera did not function 
28511 Working good 
28512 So glad I bought the extra batteries for my Canon Camera. They keep a goo charge and comes in super handy for those long days of shooting pictures. Great Price as well for the pack. 
28513 I am amazed with the quality of service and as well as how I received my order 
28514 fitted perfectly on an om-d em5 even if its not listed as compatible, and its really good. perfect as replacement for the original one it may already broken 
28515 Really hard to rotate at times. does not bend forward and back well. It is fine for the price it is at. Will get the job done for low cost 
28516 Part of the head fell apart when I went to mount the camera! I returned it and got my refund back 
28517 Got it delivered very quicjly and it is perfect for me. As a photographer, it s so nice to have something so comfortable on your back! 
28518 Received the case which I like a lot it makes the camera look very retro ad offers good protection. 
28519 works great. I use it as an access point. Setup is very easy 
28520 DO NOT BUY THIS TRASH!!! IT TOOK FOREVER FOR ME TO GET AND ITS NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE IT WAS FIRST OF ALL IT IS USED AND NOT NEW THE PASSWORDS AND USERID DID NOT WORK SO I COULD NOT RESET IT AND ADJUST THE SETTINGS! 
28521 cable s a little too short, so buy an extension cord. other than that, It works well. 
28522 Buen producto 
28523 Thank you 
28524 It is a good back up battery. It has a lot lesser charged life... about less than 2 hours maybe. Where the original Lumix can go 4+ hours of photo shooting. But for the price is worth it... 
28525 Most of the time works fine, but sometimes you have to re-connect it to the shoes to make better contact. 
28526 Good range does come in clear 
28527 Good product but it does not screw on my t3i. I heard you need the filter for it to fit I ordered one we will see if it works now. 
28528 Much cheaper than Fuji original, fits to camera, looks good, made from solid material. 
28529 I m still testing it out. I wish there was a way to turn them off to conserve the battery. 
28530 total crap. 
28531 This has worked flawlessly, nice looking and sharp images. I use on my desk at work and love the reliability and quality. 
28532 Awesome Quality! 
28533 Much better than having a camera! All pictures look good! Do not expect real colors, it s like old instant photos. Be careful not to open accidentally the film storage cover. 
28534 The seller was quick to respond to my question regarding the type of camera that the case would fit. It does fit the Cannon Rebel 1000D with the 250mm lens. I am very happy with my purchase. 
28535 wasn t all that is cracked up to be 
28536 The unit has the front red windows was broken, the horizontal movement is not smooth but jerky.The movement is continuous and can not be used for multiple shots into a panorama. 
28537 Good for a low budget tripod. 
28538 The customer service is awesome and the camera works great. Great picture and set up is easy with videos. Hard to find great customer service today and this company and product is exceeding expectations! 
28539 No prob. Good quality. Recommend 
28540 Does not operate all that well. 
28541 The best camera for adults having to much fun and great for kids too! ;) indestructible!! 
28542 Great system 
28543 This was a purchase for myself and I have found it as advertised and a good purchase. The seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with. 
28544 Can t beat for the money but don t keep a large as long as original brand batteries. 
28545 Great Product 
28546 Fits nicely, to replace my lost Nikon D5100 battery lid. Don t have to live in constant fear that the battery will fall off. 
28547 Seller was great. Very good quality camera although it is just a basic one. 
28548 Timely arrival for a great price. 
28549 Good 
28550 Work good 
28551 Lasted about a week. Camera lasted three days. Buy a &#34;real one&#34; if you want a drone. 
28552 Quality 
28553 Its a camera battery and works just fine as expected for a Canon battery. I have never had it run low, even after 400+ photos in one session, using an external flash, but the builtin. 
28554 Not calibrated very well. 
28555 kenneth helped me out setting up the camera and camera works great just not as smooth as i thought it would be but everything else is perfectly fine. 
28556 Haven t used it in the water yet, but this is a nice, comfortable hand grip. With the wrist strap, this is a no Brainer for water enthusiasts! 
28557 Great!.. Thanks 
28558 works OK hard to use 
28559 Keeps my GoPro 4 going, charges fast with my Anker chargers. 
28560 very good 
28561 A good product. 
28562 Just exactly what I was looking for. Thank you. 
28563 Love the ball design ...can angle my camera in abstract way to capture a pic and it captures right every time...also like the ability to switch from tripod to monopod without falling...not a professional photographer but highly recommend this tripod 
28564 BESTTTTTT Love it!!! 
28565 Its great just what i was looking for. 
28566 great product for price , needs better instructions , not Bluetooth cabable 
28567 Add stated for phantom 2. However screews included were for phantom 3 only. 
28568 Don t use wrist mount the part that spins Broke off when I was on my jet ski and I lost my hero 4 
28569 I purchased this item for the Nikon D7200. It s a perfect fit for both the top and rear monitors. Very easy to install, no bubbles, no troubles. Does not degrade the display quality at all. 
28570 Bien 
28571 several year later and still going strong. love this accessory so much for longer battery life and for better grip. 
28572 I was looking for a tripod for my camera and not for a phone. 
28573 We took about a days worth of pictures and another half-hour of video (flyboarding) and the battery was just about done. These work great and the charger handles the original battery from my Olympus TG-4. 
28574 This is a fun scope to take along any where. I was surprize at how clear and good viewing through it was. I like and recommend all the Orion products. 
28575 Worked ok when I was able to use it. Every one of the loops that the strap goes through came off on one end. Super glue doesn t even want to hold them in place on that cheap plastic. You get what you pay for I guess. 
28576 love it, small enough to fit in my pocket, takes great pictures. wpi;d recommend to buy it. 
28577 Works as described. expensive for what it is, but I really didn t feel like trying to build my own and the cost for dies to cut right and left hand threads, so I paid the price. 
28578 O.K. Please send me a Guide to understand better to use it. I need also drawings and guidelines because I have problems to know better to use it. Thank You 
28579 The Best...... 
28580 works as expected 
28581 So glad I found a replacement for my camera, works great! 
28582 Love this camera! Not as intimidating as I first thought it would be...takes great pictures, no buyers remorse or disappointment. Very happy with my purchase. 
28583 Getting a real canon IS lens at this price is great. It s not as hefty as the more expensive lens, but for the price, it s hard to beat. I find this a must for those interior shots where 24mm and up just don t capture what I need. 
28584 Works great! My images look fantastic. 
28585 Don t work. Don t charge 
28586 Great lengths for the money 
28587 Doesn t work for me - cannot see to focus - view is distorted. Trying to return 
28588 Excellent remote. 
28589 Exactly what I expected. 
28590 Worked great for taking pics for eBay 
28591 Works great! I ve should ve gotten one of these ages ago! Helps my night photography a great deal. 
28592 the L830 is a wonderful prosumer camera sadly the shutter speed is not controllable 
28593 Decent camera for price. Quick delivery 
28594 The product is exactly what I needed. The speed at which I received the item was very good. Used the item day after I got it and it works great. 
28595 Our lights arrived quickly and in one piece. They are bright. 
28596 I bought this and 5 weeks after I bought it the base rusted. They expect me to pay shipping cost to get replacement. Bad product, Bad company, bad support. Bad use of money 
28597 Perfect.......better than expected! 
28598 The battery is just what I wanted. Thanks. 
28599 Works over wifi or cell service from any where in the country. It does freeze if signal is weak but you can speak through it and listen to conversations. It is an excellent low budget home surveillance alternative. 
28600 So great filters with good price, high quality build. 
28601 I am very pleased with the quality of the product, and the price and prompt delivery. A+ 
28602 Ok so the selfie stick itself is pretty good and sturdy but.... The go pro attachment snapped off in my hand which was lucky because with what I do it could have been the end of my gopro... An extra $10 later I buy a real adapter which was annoying... 
28603 These actually work very well - I now have 4 of them. The product would be better served by the inclusion of instructions that are better written in english; however, that notwithstanding, they perform as would be expected by a more expensive product, and are recommended. 
28604 Lost my original charger, this one works wonderful 
28605 Fast and efficient. Your batteries exceeded my expectation. Thank you for your great customer service. 
28606 It is exactly what I ordered and what I expected 
28607 great 
28608 great flash 
28609 received as expected 
28610 High quality and durable, honestly I am very impressed with this kit for the price! 
28611 My hope was to trigger my Canon 580EX-II off camera and this bracket is perfect! Most of it is metal with the exception of the knobs and feels very sturdy. Great product! 
28612 This tutu is absolutely ADORABLE!!! The quality is great and the color was exactly as pictured. Any little girl will look like the cutest little girl in the world with this tutu abd headband. Highly recommended this product!! 
28613 I really don t use it very often, but when I need it, it does perform as expected. It might not feel super sturdy and tough, but taking the price I paid for it into account I give it 5 stars. 
28614 Fits my new Nikon P600 camera perfectly. 
28615 Awesome, as usual for Canon products!!!! 
28616 Well and aesthetically built. Works fine, uses widely available AA batteries. Now all my studio devices run on the same type batteries. Great tool for a studio or outdoors shoots where extra lights are needed. Not that easy to use as it has so many functions. I am still learning. 
28617 I bought this a couple of months ago. I am disappointed. When the wifi does work, it will only let you upload 1 photo at a time. It is slow and frustrating. I wouldn t buy this product again. Don t waste your money. 
28618 Very nice for the money. Everything fits and works wekk with my Panasonic AG-HMC80. 
28619 So happy with it, it is so compact. Also happy that it has a re-chargeable battery. Also easy to use. 
28620 Excelente. 
28621 Kind of a joke not being able to see any history without having to pay for subscription. It s not a bad camera but not the best 
28622 Great price, and works as needed. No complaints. 
28623 This was a surprise to me how much I like these. Good enough for my elaborate home studio. 
28624 Great price for remanufactured, works great with Amazon oem battery and chargers available. 
28625 I got this for my brother and it was really cool! 
28626 It works some times and doesn t work other times. I was hoping it was more reliable to use my iPad or iPhone as a monitor when shooting video but it seems to be more of a deterrent than helpful. 
28627 AMAZING! 
28628 As described. Perfect high quality Galaxy S6 dummy phone. Fast shipping! Thank you. 
28629 Great value for the price 
28630 Does NOT fit the 55-250 Canon lens. 
28631 Item delivered on time and as described. 
28632 I m very satisfied with this purchase, because it s exactly what I was looking for. It work perfectly and is the battery that I need for my video camera. I want to Thanks the seller because they still have this kind of products in existence. Thanks. 
28633 Very high quality CCD. For the price you can t go wrong. Very good fish eye lens for outdoor. 
28634 Very good camera!!! 
28635 I don t like typing 
28636 Excelent product 
28637 Great and fast shipping. Lights are near daylight and perfect for my application. 
28638 Does what it is supposed to do, hold the camera nice and tight. 
28639 Only issue is they are a bit hard to separate. 
28640 Very good film camera. What else could I say? 
28641 The color is darker than shown in the picture, but all in all a neat little case. 
28642 Its bulky, just not the fit for me. I ended up stashing it behind a tree on a hike, and leaving my camera around me neck, with my extra lense in a smaller bag. 
28643 It worked even better than what I had anticipated. I strongly recommended this little but powerful gadget. 
28644 on my phone when you plug it in the phone it act like it want to zoom so it doesn t work but I set the time on my phone and use it that way not that big of a deal 
28645 Now both my wife and my self have spare battery for our photo trips. 
28646 I like how I can start a video shoot right away and not miss the event! Haven t had it underwater yet, is nice size to keep in my purse. TY :) 
28647 good seller, I recomend 
28648 Definitely a &#34;5&#34; on a scale of 1-5 in the COOL FACTOR Ratings...Adds a little style to my new X100T...Love it! 
28649 We are using it for 5 years, and still works as day 1. 
28650 good 
28651 This works great as other reviewers noted. Still trying to figure out how to set up motion sensor to start recording. Otherwise recordings and snap shots are clear and I love the two way talk. Love to have an outside version of this video cam. 
28652 Most happy with this kit. Came with everything I needed 
28653 The A77II is a great camera.The battery grip helps for extended shoots. Picture examples from the A77II. 
28654 Great picture 
28655 It work Great 
28656 Fail. Bought two. One dead upon arrival. Would not hold a charge. 
28657 The person for whom I purchased it as a gift was delighted to have it. 
28658 Fits great and gives extra much needed grip to the smooth as silk Rx100 exterior. 
28659 Hmm quality of the construction is solid and looks good, but I found that using camera under water and then on sun the lens sweats from inside. Also lcd screen had same issue. All covers was closed and using in normal conditions. 
28660 great suport great item, 
28661 Works as expected. 
28662 great strap 
28663 ggreat product 
28664 Use these all the time. 
28665 can not delete misinstalled Canary 
28666 I love this camera. It works great. The staff is very helpful with any questions. 
28667 Great it works 
28668 Its a smaller size but its really fun and durable! 
28669 Really good 
28670 We love these little things - they are so economical, we wound up with a half-dozen - even one keeping an eye on the water heater closet. 
28671 sturdy, good product 
28672 Exactly what I was looking for. 
28673 Got it , have not had a chance to use it fully, when looking through it you can see circle s. Don t know if that is normal. 
28674 Great camera works well 
28675 still working after all this time; and doing it well 
28676 Much better than just looking at the screen from a distance. It helps me ensure I get the right adjustment for the light and it can detach since it has a magnet. 
28677 my wife loves it 
28678 Had it for a few years now. I have literally used it for about the first 3 months then bought me a real camera. This thing is the slowst camera in the world. Horrible battery life. Waist of $300.00. 
28679 Very nice! The entire package was much more than I really expected. I am very happy with my purchase. 
28680 Did exactly what I needed it to do, help my webcam fit my eyepiece. Couldn t ask any more from it. 
28681 So far so good. The product was delivered on the first day of the estimated delivery date for free shipping and packing was good too. Started using it and looks to be a good product for the price. 
28682 Works extremely well. Used for bear-detection in the mountains. 
28683 perfect 
28684 i have some problem on the button using the cover and i expected more from the battery BUT the quality video is good , 
28685 Alright part of it didn t work thougj 
28686 I m returning/exchanging this one. Doesn t charge from an outlet, only from cigarette lighter in the car. 
28687 This lens turned me into a pro. Love it. Easy to use. 
28688 The shipping time was ok. The only bad thing was that the instructions booklet and the camera strap didn´t came but I was rewarded for that. Regards. 
28689 poor resolution 
28690 Good Quality 
28691 Easy to setup and use! Very affordable as well. Worked with no issues Nikon D5200 
28692 It was what I needed and fits nicely in my camera case. 
28693 Fit on my Nikon body but did NOT fit my Minolta lens. 
28694 This is a must have if you have a NEX 7. Its great for protection, connecting over the shoulder harness and also easily clipping into my tripod (both landscape and portrait). No regrets. 
28695 Great battery for LED lamps... !! 
28696 Just what I needed! 
28697 Working fine, quick set up and fast service 
28698 Strap no good. Glasses were fine. 
28699 Perfect Fit for my new Pahntom 3, and plenty of room for the iPad Mini and extra battery. 
28700 Works perfect for my needs 
28701 An amazing camera. I just shot this music video in 4k and it came out great! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkheLRGWCZU 
28702 If the springs pop on you all you need to do is unscrew the 2 screws in the back and align the springs back and its good to go. 
28703 Item delivered on time, and works perfectly. Glad to have the keeper leash so I don t lose anymore........ 
28704 Best tripod I could buy, works well in all weather conditions. Doesn t float however :) 
28705 Couldn t even test out the set because I could only read about 1/4 of the digits/characters on the transmitter screen. NOT recommended. 
28706 Bought it for someone else 
28707 Great for travelling, the smallest of my 3 tripods. 
28708 It was great for about a month, comfortable, lightweight, but the clip broke and luckily I was holding my camera at the time or it would have been a disaster. 
28709 I ued this only 3 times, It can t be close-- only last 1 month.lose anymore, so I do not know how I can ship back. This cheap stuff is too expensive for 1 month lifespan. 
28710 It does not read, I thought maybe I was using it wrong so I asked the man that put my solar fencing in & he could not get it to read either. He used his own tester and got a reading. 
28711 Great case, protects without being bulky and at a great price. 
28712 M haaa a 
28713 Fine 
28714 Good 
28715 I love the way it looks like a WWII Leica case! 
28716 They ll work, mostly, but do yourself a favor and spend a little bit more. I had one that didn t want to let go of my lens (release button was only semi-coupled to the pin), and promptly chucked the set. 
28717 Works as described, have not had any issues yet. 
28718 great price 
28719 Great deal and batteries worked well. 
28720 Great bargain. 
28721 Great product. Not too heavy. Perfect for bringing on hikes. 
28722 Easy to install, great for security. The camera setting for recording is not totally intuitive. 
28723 Bought three of them already!!!! 
28724 Works great! 
28725 My unit was stolen, but it worked OK when I had it. 
28726 LOVE IT, works like the original. 
28727 I use these for all my delicate screens, cell phone, TV, and most of all for my navigation and compass clean up. 
28728 Easy to install. Works great. 
28729 I like it, but be careful when you receive it. The light went out on one side very easily. 
28730 This is perfect for what I intended... 
28731 these batteries were a good price and works perfect. and came with a car charger and a wall charger. i really needed the car charger. it really comes in handy. 
28732 Grate 
28733 Very Well Satisfied. 
28734 Great camera for the money. The website is convenient too. 
28735 Looks too fake-ish 
28736 Five star 
28737 Awesome... 
28738 Product was like brand new, everything worked and even came with a Sony carrying case I wasn t expecting. Very nice 
28739 I bought this camera 6 months ago. It was perfect for my needs. I looked at a bug collection that my grandkids found and also used it to watch while my students tied surgical knots. It works great and never had a problem. 
28740 Works well 
28741 Just as described. Received my camera quickly with no issues. 
28742 Works well 
28743 Nice design! Very good construction. Camera and accessories fit nicely. 
28744 Fits its purpose. No issues. 
28745 A good charger at a great price. Small, compact and does what it is supposed to do. Arrived quickly and as advertised. 
28746 Good battery,good price,and fast shipping. 
28747 Works the same as the original canon battery Good value 
28748 This is a really good ket for the price! 
28749 Great little case for your GoPro and some accessories! 
28750 Great case!! Took it overseas and it held up through a lot of abuse!! 
28751 Work great picture come out really nice ... Love it 
28752 Exelent product. 
28753 Got FV and not the FW 
28754 The greatest problem I have with this camera is the battery life. does not last but a few hours 
28755 Love. I am still learning some of the features for this is my first nice camera outside of pocket digital cameras. 
28756 works as advertised, nice price, seems to be reliable. 
28757 I could see the ends of the filter in the frame, its too long. Used with Canon EF 17-40 on full frame body. Didn t like the threaded mounting system either. 
28758 Awesome macro lens! I too, am newer to photography and recently discovered macro lenses. The shots I was &#34;attempting&#34; to capture with a standard lens seem a million times easier with this lens, and are much clearer. The price is also very good compared to others. I highly recommend. 
28759 The battery arrived fully charged and worked as well as the original equipment one had. Truly a remarkable value when compared with the price of an OE battery. 
28760 Video is washed out. Night time ir is grainy. Focus piunt seems fixed even though camer has adjustable focus. Pay the extra 10 dollars and get something better 
28761 Very good lens. Close range pictures have really nice colour and depth of field. I 
28762 Amazing and better!! Highly recommend this product. It performs better than expected. I did order another battery and a case to transport it in. 
28763 My light didn t work but from far away LOOKS REAL enough to fool average thief, the average thief isn t to bright anyway ! 
28764 Videos on my GoPro 4 hero turned out just fine! Colors looked good sharpness of video seems fine. The only thing I could see as an issue is the longevity of the product itself but for the money it was great. I would by again if needed. 
28765 Work well, thanks. 
28766 Great product and nice looking. Great for aero bars as well. 
28767 The screw that you tighten to secure the flash is very hard to grip with your finger tips. The first time I used this mount, my flash was on the floor within minutes. 
28768 It works great, especially for my camera lens. The grey cloth is the perfect size to keep in my camera bag, and I think I ll be keeping the larger one with my laptop! I would reccomend this product 
28769 Awesome value! Pictures turned out great! 
28770 The most versatile ruggedly made fun camcorder that you can do just about anything with from outside sport activities there s a very special moments in the home I would recommend this to everyone 
28771 Really bright. ...!!! 
28772 Replaced a previous model that had worn out over time. 
28773 Exactly what I expected 
28774 NICE ASSORTMENT OF ITEMS TO COMPLIMENT THE MINI 8 CAMERA. 
28775 Nice price and good condition. Highly recommend. 
28776 Very cheap quality. Does not fit the tripod. 
28777 STK always a winner. 
28778 Great product. Highly recommended. 
28779 Great simple camera 
28780 Good 
28781 Works perfectly! 
28782 So powerful. So useful. Get this in your camera bag right now. I know people that have 2 or 3 of these. You will not be disappointed. 
28783 Excellent product. 
28784 serves its purpose really well. 
28785 the camera, the lenses, the spare battery, the spare charger, the memory card and the lens converters are alright. I didn t like the flash, the bag and the tripod. The long distance shutter didn t work. 
28786 very good 
28787 Great! Received as described. 
28788 great value 
28789 You have moved an old timer into the digital age with this purchase. I m learning how to use yet, but I m satisfied with my purchase. 
28790 Great batteries. As far as I am concerned they are very close if not on par with the standard &#34;Canon batteries&#34;. Great Deal. Very Pleased. 
28791 So coll 
28792 Robust air blower. Never run out of air. No disposable cans. 
28793 Well-built, seems sturdy. The GoPro adapter can be unscrewed, leaving a traditional screw camera mount, so it works for other cameras as well. Very pleased. 
28794 The HD picture quality is outstanding. I am thoroughly pleased!! 
28795 It s a battery 
28796 Works well as a greenhouse/fish tank monitor. More resolution would be nice but this is adequate. It connected up at a distance of 40 feet or so from the router. 
28797 Very happy with purchase. 
28798 the image is not clear an not wide enough, do not waste your money in this purchase 
28799 Great price. Fine product. Works as expected. 
28800 Bad product but good customer service. I have bought two of these and both died after just a few months. I got a third one for free after I complained but this one also died after a few weeks! 
28801 The product works as advertised. You have to make sure the flash clicks into place though or it will not work properly. 
28802 Only problem encountered was a defective USB cable. I had to scrounge one from my drawer. The setup and subsequent use is very good. The software is an improvement over Drop Cam and I currently am using two of those. 
28803 This camera does not work 
28804 Great lense, good for shallow DOF 
28805 Clips and holds pretty nicely. Def a great replacement for a stock clip on cap. It was shipped from China, but came in roughly 2 weeks. So all in all... good buy. 
28806 This fits perfectly in my backpack to turn the front pouch into a camera bag! This way I can bring other things like clothes, water bottles, snacks, maps, etc. dedicated bags aren t quite as versatile, so this gives you the best of both worlds :) 
28807 The studio lighting is great for video and pictures. 
28808 Very good and easy to use. 
28809 Not bad for the price, it is not as good as original Nikon battery, but as a backup it is not going to disappoint you. 
28810 works as advertised! 
28811 good product 
28812 Very cute background! Looks exactly like pictured. 
28813 Excellent product, was everything it calmed to be. Fast shipping, friendly CS 
28814 bought to go with camera for 11 year old selfie generation- she loves it 
28815 It took me a little while to get everything working according to the instructions, including using sim card from at@t, but I m happy with the system. I did have a bad window/door switch but received a new one after notifying support@pisector. Their support people worked with me very well. 
28816 Works great 
28817 It works great for the camera and the other pockets will come in handy for something. 
28818 It works. 
28819 This a quality bag for a bargain price. I use this for a Sony Nex-7, multiple lenses, tripod, and all my accessories. 
28820 It works for my camera 
28821 Almost impossible to place on dog. 
28822 it is hard and inconvenient to connect, let alone keep the connection going. 
28823 Great lens, super lightweight, perfect for travel, great image quality. 
28824 Works great on my 150-600 mm 
28825 Just bought an Olympus underwater camera, used just one of the two floaty included and it works like a charm. 
28826 Motion detection doesn t work. 
28827 It s a rechargeable battery. It s still taking a charge after 4 years. What else can I say? 
28828 Perfect for my 75-300mm lens! Well made case. I love this case and having my 2nd lens right on my hip. I hate having to get into my bag every time I what to switch lenses, this case saves me so much time! 
28829 Fast service and good for beginner this is my first drome and is easy to fly...... 
28830 good item 
28831 Good 
28832 Pretty good but i have Android 5.02 which should work with WiFi feature but it does not No way of telling if it really does have WiFi or not. 
28833 Used it for the first time on my family vacation. Though I was a little nervous at first but it was an actually good buy. 
28834 LOVE THIS!!!!! 
28835 This latch doesn t hold as tight as the original GoPro latch and will let water in. GoPro replaced the original broken latch for free even after 2 years. I know keep this latch as a non-waterproof backup. 
28836 I ve ordered two of these lights and both begin to flicker after being powered on for about 30 min as they start to warm up. 
28837 Good 
28838 worked good 
28839 Bought 2 of these batteries! Work great in my Canon rebel xti! 
28840 Product as described, love it and would buy it again, thanks! 
28841 Awesome!!! 
28842 Love these reflectors! They pack up nice and compact and fit right in my camera bag. 
28843 Happy experience! 
28844 This was to be a NEW item. It WASNT. 
28845 The Camera is so great, like others in the segment, the accesories kit is fine and usefull but not so well made. Hope all of the parts works properly (425USD) for all was 
28846 At first I thought that the camera was going to not be of high quality, but I was wrong. The Fujikam camera has exceeded my expectations and I am very happy with this product. 
28847 perfect 
28848 It s not easy to use as there is no view finder so you re not really sure what you re shooting and it s very far away and you have to do manipulation on the photo to get a good print before you can post or use the picture. 
28849 One of the best values I have ever found. I don t care what others say, Cowboy Studios sells good products at better than affordable prices. If you are just starting out in photography, or a seasoned pro, you can t beat CS prices and quality. 
28850 Very sturdy, note that it will fit an unusual size pole. 
28851 Camera is still great. 
28852 didnt fit for my camera 
28853 Thanks Works Well! 
28854 It is a great buy !!! I had to return because it was not I wanted not because any problems 
28855 very Good 
28856 Did not fit my iPhone with the case. 
28857 This is a very fun camera, I appreciate Fuji for picking up the mantle after Polaroid, but it is seems a little oversized. In fact it is HUGE. 
28858 Love this tripod, very study 
28859 Quick and easy claim process! 
28860 great case. camera fits in it well. 
28861 This fish eye lens is comparable to the actual cannon version but at less of the cost. I have used these lens millions of times and I get great photos. I get great angle shots and lots of different views. 
28862 it s small and adorable, but the pictures come out too dark and the resolution is not great, just average. the pictures are misleading. 
28863 Looks to be what I needed. Thank you 
28864 Good price and very short time for delivery. 
28865 Outdated 
28866 Worked great, charged my orginal battery,and the battery that came with it. I recommend 
28867 Exactly what I was looking for...a camera case that did not disconnect from the camera when the camera is in use. It easily fit my smaller zoom and was a perfect fit for my Canon 35-300 Zoom. 
28868 AC Adapter die just after 1 yr 
28869 Good 
28870 Sturdy and well made 
28871 okay 
28872 Absolutely the best purchase 
28873 This case is bad ass. Sort of a tight fit around the motors (with the new Vortex limiting straps installed). I took pictures and sent the feedback to GPC.. all in all, terrific case 
28874 Only played with them slightly, but, enjoying them 
28875 Links easily with Honeywell L7000. 
28876 This lens is pretty cool. Can t beat the price, and it does just what its supposed to. Its also very lightweight, yet durable. A nice addition to my camera bag. 
28877 Got this case for my wife s large Panasonic point and shoot camera. It fit perfectly and had room for cables. Excellent quality bag and my wife loves the color to boot! 
28878 Currently using it on a bracket connected to my OMD E-M5 Mark ii and it works perfectly. 
28879 does what it says its gonna do 
28880 it works really good 
28881 I ordered for a Canon D10 and I received a Vivitar Kit. 
28882 A+++++, Will buy again! Excellent in all aspects & highly recommend!! Thank you! 
28883 love this 
28884 Nice addition to my gopro stuff 
28885 Works as advertised 
28886 Product worked well...it charged the batteries, and a green light indicated when to unplug the charger. excellent 
28887 Got everything in this plus a couple extra things. The suction cup is a little small. But zero complaints 
28888 I needed these to hold a few old 8x10 school photos and other nostalgic pics of yesteryear! Great protection for important mementos that are strictly 8x10 or smaller (unlike the 8.5x11 page protectors, which are slightly larger). Highly recommended. 
28889 True to description! Slim and user-friendly. My only complaint is that the photos are in the same order every time and that the memory card doesn t get inserted completely. There s a margin at the edge, so be careful if packing it with the card stored in it. 
28890 This was the perfect solution to my addiction to larger lens for my wildlife requirements. It has plenty enough room and i find comfortable for my use. AAA+ 
28891 works great and so much cheaper then the gopro one 
28892 Great mount! It can be put on a bar or handle as well as your wrist! Solid quality and trust my contour s life with it. 
28893 I thought it was for panoramic photos-it is better suited for close ups where you want a wider shot. 
28894 Fits perfectly 
28895 This would be an excellent bag/organizer for a GoPro if it was a little bigger. It just doesn t hold enough accessories! 
28896 This device a while go open it up yesterday today is the 21st August it don t work I want my money back piece of junk I charged it all night then turned it on and nothinghappen didn t clock did not even come on send me a return slip 
28897 good fit 
28898 it doesn t fit the whole screen so dirt and stuff collects at the edges. 
28899 Great item!. Used it to monitor my feline while away. 
28900 Perfect to stabilize my camera and perfect for iPhone when doing Flipagram for stop motion animation. You just need a part to hold the iphone, which you can find on Amazon, too. 
28901 Tiffin always axe a decent product. They sent me wrong size for my camera lens. Instead of 40.5 I got a 43.5. Trying to see if I can use it on another lens 
28902 Q-See has good equipment. These cables work just fine with Q-See camera. 
28903 pretty steady for indoor use 
28904 Definitely like this unit, its extremely solid as far as the frame and rods, The motors work ok with my cameras and are a bit noisy but that was expected if they hold up over time I will definitely give this rig 5 stars. 
28905 Nice set for the money. Had a hell of a time setting it up but it all works. It s not 5 stars because I m having trouble logging in because the name and password given to me for first log in don t work. 
28906 Same performance as the OEM battery at a much better price. 
28907 Nice and fresh. 
28908 😀 
28909 Charger for my Canon camera batteries. You can never have enough. Charged like the original, no overheating and my batteries did not lose the charge as some claimed. Its perfect for what I needed. 
28910 Only 9 out of 10 worked, which was disappointing when I had planned to take four pictures knowing I had four films left. The last one printed blank. 
28911 Missing some stuff 
28912 It did not fit my Sony a330 like I was told so I went to Florida for a week vacation with no camera cause of this. 
28913 Great service! Great product! 
28914 Very Happy with my Drone 
28915 Bought it again after losing it in the woods. I used it exclusively outdoors during hiking/climbing/camping. It stood up to the abuse very well for almost 8 months. 
28916 These cameras are great! We ordered two, and one of the selfie mirrors... used them at my daughter s wedding reception. Very fun idea, and not that expensive. 
28917 great picture quality, love the custom menu options. The only bad thing about this minister is that the battery mount falls off REALLY easily. Like I m about to gaff it on its so bad. But other than that the actual monitor is wonderf. 
28918 The batteries are perfectly fine, but the charger takes several hours to recharge just one battery. 
28919 Great battery last for long time for mic in sunday service for the church. 
28920 Love this strap! I wish I had another camera so I could buy another one! Very innovative 
28921 I was shipped a broken product. Gooseneck seems fine but without the clip it is unusable. 
28922 It s a great addition to my 5d mark III! Also amazing on the RED and great having the downstream LUTs for video village viewing! 
28923 Using camera for business -real estate photos - used just the auto setting but photos were amazing! 
28924 So fun to put on my dogs. They are a little confused with it on them, and try and take it off but once they get used to it they forget its on the,. 
28925 Love it, solid protection and easy installation! My screen is now protected and my investment is safe! To top it off its made in the USA!! 
28926 I got this as a replacement for another company s camera that lost the ability to get on a wireless network. I really like this camera. Easy setup, lots of instructions and support software. The images are incredible and the night vision is perfect. 
28927 Loving this system we have had in for a couple weeks or so now and it is pretty simple to set up. Also had to email support from Zmodo with a question and I got an answer back the next day in full details.. Awesome customer service!! 
28928 Very nice digital frame... Worth the money! 
28929 I wish the strap was a little longer but that s my only issue with it. 
28930 This was my 2nd roll of film, (right after the Tri-X 400). I also had this developed right away, and I love the results. I will be using much more of this film as well. 
28931 good 
28932 Shot one roll and immediately had it developed. This film is wonderful! Can t wait to use the rest. 
28933 San disk Mico SD a great media or I can say its a great performance card,greatly recommend to anyone. And the Nikon battery EN-EL 15 a long lasting life I love it 
28934 Love using these. Gives a great warmth and life to photos 
28935 Awesome 
28936 ok 
28937 Works really well, I have them in several rooms so I will always have one handy. 
28938 Works like a dream! 
28939 Awesome bag, great quality and smart design. I have space for everything. Carries tripod under as in photo. Completely waterproof, and it makes everything feel lightweight while carrying. I want to get one in all colors! 
28940 Flimsy!!! Poles seemed bent! Parts missing! 
28941 Lightweight, nice balance and cool looking. These fit on my Phantom 2, just for all those wondering. 
28942 good product 
28943 easy to apply, as expected 
28944 The LCD Viewfinder keeps fall of the camera. 
28945 A must for diy home security rigs and led uv boosters. 
28946 These lenses are very fun! I love how it s three different lenses in one! Product came as and when expected! Fit my iPhone 5 just well. Takes really cool pictures, you can get SO much more in the frame! 
28947 This is My Second Fuji Camera , I love them 
28948 for the Dollar ! Great Zoom for a cheaper camera 
28949 It was easy as 123 I love 
28950 Held charge forever! Lastest all day; photos and videos. 
28951 evth ok! 
28952 Great product, works well. Good value for the price. This was replacement to my old tripod and I am happy with it. 
28953 good 
28954 Very versatile. I can charge at home or in my car. 
28955 Perfect. 
28956 Item was received just as described. 
28957 Works but took along time to set up. not the easist set up but once installed has been good. 
28958 Will not last very long a year or so at most 
28959 Durable and well made, lightweight and lots of room. Easily fits under airplane seats. A must for traveling with your photography equipment. 
28960 AWESOME CAMERA!!!!!!!!!!!! GLAD I PURCHASED IT. PICTURES ARE GREAT. 
28961 Shipping was good. Battery works fine. 
28962 It s just what I needed. 
28963 I think this is my second 10 pack of these types of clothes. As a family of forgetful glasses wearers, we go through and lose quite a lot of these. They work wonderfully though! 
28964 I know this bag is for NEX, I have a A6000, I thought they were almost the same, well, I was wrong, the inner bag is too small for it...... the bag itself is of good quality. 
28965 My biggest complaint with this is the battery compartment; it is awkward to open and close and its hard to keep your batteries and photo chip in plae 
28966 Worth the money. 
28967 I like the ability of screen flipping between the cameras. The on thing I would suggest is to increase the storage amount. 32 my would be preferred. 
28968 Basic as it gets but it gets the job done without hurting the wallet. 
28969 works like original battery. 
28970 Excelent 
28971 Product works as advertised 
28972 good product, so far working very well 8/9/2015. 
28973 perfect 
28974 No instructions, thanks! 
28975 Compared this to a brand new battery for the same camera and this lasted about 1/4 of the time of the new battery. You are getting what you pay for here. Only lasted about 2.5 hours with continuous use. Not really worth it. 
28976 Great camera for a great price. Super fast shipping. I recommend it! 
28977 Bad camera not good at all 
28978 Excellent product, and buying experience. I will buy in future 
28979 cool looking bag!! Good enough to carry a medium sized DSLR with 18-140mm attached onto it. And a 50mm lens. + the charger and cables. Anything more you will need a larger sized bag. 
28980 Pay the extra money for the best. Do Not Waste money on the cheaper products. 
28981 It would be nice if they had indications of what they were. Specifically the color and strength. 
28982 Bought for my boyfriend for his birthday in April, last month (July) the camera stopped working and won t turn on. Need to contact the company and hope they will work with me and replace it! 
28983 Highly recommended for a Canon 7D Mark II with a Canon EF 24-105 mm f/4L IS USM lens! 
28984 good product 100% 
28985 i love this camera! must buy product if you like traveling 
28986 It´s a very good product. I found it confortable to handle it. 
28987 ok 
28988 Vincent very knowledgeable and very helpful. 
28989 This filter works great for enhancing twilight and sundown colors. I saw a video from Bryan Peterson showing how well worked, and I ve tried it a few times with great results. 
28990 Reliable and much cheaper than the original. It s a little tight in the battery compartment of the camera, so sometimes we need to give it an extra push with a blade/key to pop it out. Camera operation is definitely as good with this battery as the original. 
28991 good deal! 
28992 Love my frame! 
28993 Great set for a good price. Quick shipping too. 
28994 Great camera! Love the quality of the photo. Very crisp and clear for a small camera 
28995 Good price. 
28996 Great item to allow me to see the camera LCD on a sunny day. 
28997 Great device and I bought for very good price 
28998 I haven t tried the Panasonic version of this cap, but I will say this one works perfectly. Probably not quite as tight against fine dust as the stock, hand-removable, cap, but very convenient, protective, and considerably cheaper than the Panny. 
28999 Great product... 
29000 may be Anti-glare. But because the surface is &#34;frosted&#34; it s difficult to see though. 
29001 Returned the item.send wrong item 
29002 Have only needed one battery replacement, in 2009, for camera purchased in 2005. These batteries work great. 
29003 good for price, working great 
29004 Very good product, I would recommend it. 
29005 Bought these as backups for my Pentax WG-10. They last as long, if not longer, than the OEM battery (which is not that long to begin with). Great price. Worth buying for extra shooting time, since these cameras suck up the juice pretty quickly. 
29006 Great bag for the price! 
29007 GOOD 
29008 I brought this awesome tripod for my sister and she absolutely loves it :-). Thanks! Dear eCost, I have rated the tripod. Here is my name and order number: Name: Dwayne Martin ORDER # 112-3476448-4701025 
29009 Go big or go home. If you hike, have some camera gear and other stuff, this pack is for you. It is big, well built, functional and roomy for everything you could imagine including a camera or two. 
29010 Just the right fit 
29011 ok...ok 
29012 A highly capable lens for a bargain price. I ve since switched all my gear over to Fuji, but would recommend this to anyone with a Canon looking for a budget lens. 
29013 Great service from the supplier, Amazon Prime gives you peace of mind, the drone is working well. 
29014 Works great for my Canon Rebel EOS T3i when the battery needs to charge but I still want to snap pictures. Decent length cord so you are not super tethered to a wall. 
29015 ...I used to store a Fuji X-E2 camera, fits correctly. 
29016 Absolutely great camera and huge bonus with all the accessories! Definitely recommend anyone looking for a great camera to purchase this bundle set!! 
29017 great strap 
29018 I am quite pleased with these little clothes. I leave one at each spot I leave one of my pairs of reading glasses (all over the house and my office). great clothes and a good value 
29019 Works very well. 
29020 Great price, work perfectly 
29021 Received product and tried installing it myself, that didn t work. Called D-Link customer service and received excellent assistance from Employee id# AR004671 
29022 Take with me all the time 
29023 The idia it s good and pricticle, but i being try to charge the remote control and i can t get a 100% charge. 
29024 Exactly what was needed. Worked as anticipated immediately and was pleasantly surprised with the additional charging devices. Appreciated the quick delivery. 
29025 Excellent. 
29026 Nice package but I did not realize the filters were only for the wide lens. No problem. 
29027 Fun 
29028 I had a couple of parts broken. A Lense was chipped and broken apart and the mini tripod broke but otherwise everything else works just fine. The tripod might be my fault though I don t know. 
29029 This is a great bag! It has great features to hold all my camera needs!!!!! 
29030 Decent camera, GORGEOUS screen and excellent functionality as far as sharing your photos on social media instantly, but if you re a serious amateur shutterbug, give this camera a pass. NOT good for theater/concert pictures. :/ 
29031 Easy to use 
29032 As advertised. Great replacement as it is longer than the factory cord. 
29033 This works just fine for my 18-5m lens for my Sony nex 3n! I m quite happy with it and see no problems! 
29034 fit my go pro hero 2 so I m good 
29035 Love love this bag much better then my previous one lots of space. Great ease of handling wish I would have had this one first. 
29036 Performed as expected. Reasonable quality for the price. Would recommend to a friend 
29037 awesome in every way. don t get a gopro, get the read deal. this blows gopro away. great seller 
29038 Makes it easy to align and do long exposures. 
29039 As someone over 6 feet tall, the strap is shorter than I like it. Other than that its great. Fit my Canon G16 perfect 
29040 perfect 
29041 It works properly and charges the battery quickly! 
29042 It has a nice level and quick release but the lock doesn t always hold well. 
29043 Makes a big difference in comfort from the original one that came with the camera. I can barely feel that it is there. 
29044 I can t live without it. Very nice product and good quality. 
29045 Changed up fine. Work well. 
29046 Most of the package is good. But the tripod is cheaply made. 
29047 Great 
29048 It s perfect for a nikon j4 or any of the series. 
29049 Works great. I have had no issues 
29050 Quick delivery, great camera features. Sharp colors, 42x zoom easy to use. 
29051 So great, purchased this for a 10th birthday. It was a huge hit ! 
29052 Perfect fit to the &#34;T&#34; 
29053 I feel like this case protects my camera very well. It stands up and has great padding inside. I like the &#34;hammock&#34; it keeps the camera from sitting on its lens. Only issue I have is that the zipper gets stuck on the corners or the bag with unzipping. 
29054 It has been so hard to take decent pictures with my camera phone!!! Finally someone came up with a way to IMPROVE the pics with THIS PRODUCT!! LOVE THIS!! 
29055 Great quality for the price! Still trying to get used to the whole connect wireless with WI-FI but overall it s worth it! 
29056 works great cheap price 
29057 Nice but for my TG-3 with the silicon skin it is a very tight fit. 
29058 Very good credit card machine works well! 
29059 Works as expected 
29060 looks absolutely real!! good quality for price!! 
29061 Don t waste your money. It doesn t hardly enlarge the slides at all, and is very cheaply made. 
29062 every thing ok 
29063 Too visible. I wanted a light that was less conspicuous. 
29064 Just what I needed. 
29065 Did its job 
29066 as expected 
29067 Good 
29068 Arrived at specified date. I have mo problems at all with it. It does seem a really good beginner drone. Crashed it a lot but with no breakage at all. Just picked up and took off again. 
29069 Nice but the bluetooth will not work the video on S6 Edge. 
29070 Perfect for aluminum housing for GoPro 4. Nice add-on. 
29071 Works well with Night Owl and Swann systems 
29072 Great quality Tripod! 
29073 No complaints here. Easy to use and makes the most of my poor photography skills. 
29074 This lens is not tack sharp. I had this exact lens before and it broke and that lens was much sharper than this one.... not sure what the deal is. 
29075 muy bueno 
29076 Easy to assemble and great quality. Would recommend for anyone! 
29077 I needed a spare battery and this charger was bundled with two, so that s it! 
29078 This camera is working perfectly in my home. I LOVE the wide angle lens, the motion detector and the Mic. 
29079 Thanks ...!! 
29080 I love it, hook it to a tree, railing, small, fits in your pocket. 
29081 Good solid case, protects memory cards very well. 
29082 I absolutely love this case; it fits my camera perfectly and has room for all of it s cords and accessories! 
29083 Best one I ve found so far, doesn t completely block the flash on the camera like the others do. 
29084 Takes awesome.pictures! Was really impressed! 
29085 Fits well 
29086 As advertised. 
29087 http://youtu.be/aQB3NtnNnlk 
29088 Bon produit et livraison rapide 
29089 Ok product. No a bad product but I should have got a more heavy duty product for surfing. 
29090 Works great. Perfect for multiple shots over long time periods. Or many quick shots in short time periods. Great for long exposure too. 
29091 Easy to install works nicely !! 
29092 perfect replacement for the remote. 
29093 Perfect charge 
29094 I got this mainly because I needed a clear filter to protect lens, and this was red on the outside, thought the matching red caps would be cool as well. Cap is cheap, falls off pretty easily with a little bump, but the filter is still nice. 
29095 its a pass trought device only, so make sure you have powered mics other than that is very well built and makes it convenient if you have multiple recording devices and or external mics. 
29096 Super heavy 
29097 nice product for the price 
29098 I installed two of these with Foscam 12 volt cameras. They work! 
29099 Arrived on time, but with open box. Filter a little dusty, plastic case obviously opened. No sign of wear on filter, though. 
29100 Good one 
29101 Very bright and useful only negative is the light has more of a blue tint rather than a natural light color which in turn leaves pictures with a. Blue hue. 
29102 Amazing binoculars for a great price! 
29103 cheaply made with bad quality.not real gopro stuff 
29104 I m a little disappointed that I had to pay to replace the top plate for one that actually works. Especially after I exchanged emails with them about the original being wonky. 
29105 Delivery was on time and case holds everything I use. 
29106 Small enough to fit in my messenger bag and super light weight. 
29107 Great quality picture and range of motion... 
29108 This product is far better than i thought it would be, very sturdy. 
29109 This does not fit Panasonic DMC-GF2. 
29110 I like the concept of this, and it works alright, but it makes it so you have to unscrew it to change the battery on the Nikon D5200. Not sure about other models of camera. 
29111 It s ok. Seems solidly built. Started immediately getting some sticky liquid coming out of the joints (viscous coupling?). It s not what I expected though... 
29112 this is a great little camera very happy with it 
29113 Very Good 
29114 An excellent and affordable way to protect your home. We have been using for about a year now. Still love it!!! 
29115 Works great. 
29116 nice easy use 
29117 good little camera. I use it on my boat 
29118 it s interesting toy,cheap than gopro,worth the price. 
29119 I saw some posts that suggested the battery was generic. Mine definitely said it was a Sony. What more can you say about a battery until it s been used for a while? Guessing it will be like other Sony products - very good. 
29120 Excellent 
29121 Selfie #YOLO 
29122 Love, Love, Love! 
29123 I ve been using Canon L lenses and this ND Filter is the worst I ever seen. Not even on manual focus can not get a decent picture. Sometimes cheaper is expensive is you are gonna lose clients taking photos. 
29124 working like a champ. way better than original batterys 
29125 Work awesome and it s extra long!!! 
29126 Works--keep checking for tightness 
29127 Product is very good and satisfactory. This seller s items are always welcome. 
29128 great battery and one I highly recommend to have on hand if you have an nx camera 
29129 Absolutely love my new Canon Soeedlite! It makes such a huge difference in my picture taking. My pictures now look like professional pictures. And it s not as hard to use as I d thought ! 
29130 Great case for a mirrorless slr (Sony a5100) Small enough to carry around easily but big enough to carry the camera and some accessories. The built in rain cover is really great. 
29131 This is a really nice tripod, the price was lower than I would expect for something this nice. 
29132 The degree of play due to the overall design/manufacturing and plastic internals make it hard to adjust and use this for reliably accurate focusing. 
29133 its solid...like a good battery 
29134 Comes with all the pieces and features you would need in a simple tripod. I love the quick release base. 
29135 Very good product so far I din t have any problem 
29136 Works perfectly, just what I needed 
29137 After light use, the ball head no longer holds. It shifts from one side to another, in a straight line, under light pressure. The no-name one I bought before this one works great. Go figure. 
29138 Great battery charger. I am very happy with the item and great sellers to do business with. Will most certainly buy from them again when I need something for my camera. Thank you! 
29139 Easily floats the Olympus TG-4 
29140 instructions are minimal. I can t seem to use this product because it doesn t seem compatible with my camera. I reached out to cowboy studio to see if they sold a remote connection and they never responded to my inquiry. 
29141 I really like this camera the quality of photos and videos are amazing. Very easy to use... 
29142 Lots of space. So far so good. Wish there was a water holding spot 
29143 works well with my all Canon lens, slow with autofocus, don t work with my Tamron 28-75 2.8 in Autofocus, but all of them work fine in Manual focus. 
29144 nice lens. 
29145 Exactly what I was expecting. Nice quality, great price. Even nicer that the owner hand signed a thank you in pen. 
29146 Good high resolution BNC camera for the money... Great daytime images 
29147 OK for night does need better infrared for night use to get better images. 
29148 I’m truly disappointed with this product. At f5 150mm your picture is ok but as soon as you ZOOM further to 600mm the picture is get Hazy. I am waiting on a replacement...wouldn t recommend this product unless this issue is resolved. 
29149 This was perfect for my husband s home base business. It works great for his green screen. He has now picked up more business and making quality videos. I would recommend this to anyone. Great product and price. 
29150 Excelent 
29151 This is one of the best built monopods I have ever owned. High quality all the way through it and never an issue to work with. Recommend very highly. You cannot beat having this one. It works with you, no matter how you have to use it. I love mine. 
29152 Fast delivery, quality product. Thanks ! 
29153 Such a good price for a gopro product 
29154 This camera did not last very long. I ve got some that where bought direct from Lowes and they are still going strong. This camera only lasted 7 months before it died! Not sure why this one died so quick. 
29155 The lock broken in one month. It is very danger for an expensive DSLR. 
29156 https://youtu.be/XRIlIN1fJPg 
29157 Worked perfect. 
29158 China made crap. 
29159 Great Price. Great Service. 
29160 It was a gift for Grandson 
29161 Best color checker out there. 
29162 Excellent product and good price with good delivery time. This camera make me happy because i can take good quality pictures 
29163 This is a great little camera takes good photos this is the 4th one i bought. if it did not drop them they would last a lot longer for me. use it a lot and have taken thousand of photos with them for work 
29164 How is nobody talking about the fact that this camera doesn t have an external mic port!!! 
29165 This is a fantastic camera ! I m still learning all the things it can do, but I m well pleased with both the quality of photos and ease of operation. 
29166 Just what I expected. Very nice and in perfect condition. 
29167 Luv it....so much like my old Canon didn t take me long to learn. 
29168 Batteries stopped holding charge a year later. My SONY batteries that I bought with the camera long before that are still holding. Will not buy again. 
29169 love it works great 
29170 good 
29171 Perfect Product. I think it is great. 
29172 Amazing lens! My favorite lens! 
29173 Super light case that has just enough room for your base camera equipment along with a hydration pack. 
29174 thank you 
29175 Item received as described, thanks. 
29176 It could be better! 
29177 Connectors weren t fit right. 
29178 Good camera. Night vision is good 
29179 Gemtune 577C is a well build quick release plate. When I bought it I was hoping it was going to fit on my Benro S4 tripod head and it did! It fits perfect!!! And it also feets on my Benron K5 tripod head not perfect but it works. 
29180 Worked as stated 
29181 Convenient.Works as advertised 
29182 exact replacement for the charger I misplaced works great, shipped quickly 
29183 Perfect for my coolpix 530. Well padded with plenty of room for charger and extra batteries 
29184 Using it for DSC-RX100M3. Works fine. 
29185 Great transaction and looking forward to my next purchase. Can t believe the price versus high quality! These are my standard lens filters now and go on every lens I get from now on! 
29186 Best tripod for a heavy camera and lens! Agility and construction designed well. Based on the fact that the unit is designed to hold heavy components, it s a bit heavy, but I woul buy it again for a second camera. 
29187 This is a handy addition to your lens collection. It is a two part lens. The wide angle distance shots do have a curve to them. So be aware that it is not going to be a straight on shot. The macro portion is great! 
29188 Practical. Now, have battery to long time =) 
29189 Worked well. 
29190 NONE 
29191 these work great. i continue to buy more 
29192 Works, Can t really think of anything I would change. 
29193 Really good... More than expected... 
29194 I needed a tabletop tripod to use with my spotting scope on my terrace overlooking the East River in Manhattan. This small, sturdy item holds my heavy Kowa with ease. 
29195 No complaints, fit my product without any problems 
29196 Very nice product--cloths clean my glasses without scratching the lenses. I appreciate the individual plastic sleeves as well. 
29197 Very good 
29198 I could not activate the camera on my mac. Going to the default IP address by directly connecting to the mac or through the switch did not work. (It just hangs.) The included SADP software only works on Windows. It is going back. 
29199 Awesome works great! I love it! 
29200 worked great. Exactly what I needed. Expect to use them for a long time. 
29201 After figuring out how to sync my YN-560III flashes, the unit works great. The only thing I wish to be included in this unit is that Yongnuo put an option to turn off and on the flashes. 
29202 does take a day or 2 in the sun to charge batteries, but if you have enough you can always have some that are fully charged. 
29203 Henry very fast service. lots ok knowledge. pleasant to work with.I will recommend this product to all my friends. great camera. 
29204 good product. easy to configure 
29205 Great camera! 
29206 obodys perfect. Came as advertised. on time, just what I expected. 
29207 great product worked better than I expected delivery was on time 5 star all the way 
29208 great affordable lens. adds a nice touch to composition and does what it needs to do. works great on my sony a7 
29209 The security guys asked for $600, Well I bought these and installed them on existing wires as I had replaced my windows. Work like a charm , tested with security company all reeds work 100% 
29210 Inner lining separated. Poor stitching. I only used it a few times. But, unfortunate for me the return period has passed. I have only had it since June. 
29211 all wrong need np-fp50 
29212 Best buy! 
29213 The plastic ring around the lenses cracked just from having it in a bag. For a waterproof/ shockproof case this is absolutely unacceptable. Also the seal tends to not seat correctly so you have to really press to get it to seal. 
29214 No bag to carry the equipment and the umbrellas seem to be on the very low end of quality. 
29215 Meant for the 5D3 feels like a perfect extension of the camera. 
29216 excellent! 
29217 Same dust/oil spots issue as with D600 -- it s back to Nikon for maintenance again. Auto-focus gives up in low-light. 
29218 all ok 
29219 Not a real kit; multiple individual items shipped as a &#34;kit&#34;. The only authentic Canon item was the cleaning cloth. 
29220 Crystal clear view and a great addition to my cctv pack 
29221 Simply a joke and a ripoff. I had to place the leg of my dehumidifier on the battery to keep it in place long enough to charge it. Does not work. 
29222 Good value and perfect way to protect your lens investment. 
29223 Batteries are good for backup but are by far not as good as originals 
29224 thank you i feel more comfortable in my home now as it as done a wonderful job thank you again 
29225 Happy with the quality 
29226 Batteries charge quickly, and they use the same charging cable as the GoPro which is nice. Battery life is comparable to that of the battery that came with the GoPro; No complaints here!! 
29227 Love the ease of use and speed of attaching. I had to buy a second one for a second camera. Would highly recommend 
29228 I love it! 
29229 the product does not fit my Nikon D3300 camera even though it claim it does. But the return is pretty easy 
29230 Very light and comfortable. Seems like good quality for the price. The clasp mechanism is quite secure, though I use the backup strap as well just in case. Best solution I have used, way better than a regular neck strap, or just holding the camera in your hand. Very satisfied. 
29231 Excellent 
29232 Perfect item. Fits as snug as the one that came when I purchased the unit. Highly recommend this product and seller! 
29233 the filter is well made. and works well. 
29234 for the price i paid its good 
29235 Very good 
29236 Fun and cute designs! Order cam fast and in great condition. Would recommend! 
29237 I love the shots it captures and the price was right. 
29238 Steady, lightweight, and resistant. The ball head is ok for the price. But I would recommend to buy another if your doing panoramic or night photography. 
29239 The strap is comfortable. Would appreciate some instruction or suggested attachment ideas. None was included.. Tried to email provider but the suggested address didn t work 
29240 Camera fit perfectly in it! 
29241 great 
29242 A bit of wind can knock it over but it s ideal for the price. My first tripod and I m super happy with what I got. Stands up well and tall, also the grip latches work strong and in all it was a perfect buy. I highly recommend! :) 
29243 good camera, good quality videos even is 25 fps max on 1080p, the materials quality is ok 
29244 Good size, well padded, extra storage space, good price, and well built. 
29245 The band is high quality, but not quite wide enough. It tends to contract into the small space between the front of the lens and the manual focusing ring. 
29246 Although the unit seems to work fine (after modification). It did not include the us adaptor as advertised. 
29247 Works great!!! 
29248 Flimsy when up. Hard to handle without flipping over 
29249 Battery and charger are good 
29250 Everything in this kit has been very useful and one heck of a price. THe lens is sharp, light weight and everything you need for a walking. 
29251 performs well 
29252 Just got my X1 CPL and the thinness of the unit is absolutely incredible. I will be testing it out soon and leaving another review. But so far the packaging and the ultra slim construction have impressed me. 
29253 The first one I got wasn t a perfect fit for the lens, so they sent me a new one. Works great for my Sigma 18 - 35mm. With my Canon 70 - 210mm, it causes vignetting. 
29254 excellent product. 
29255 This is way hard to manipulate. 
29256 If you don t worry about pets, open the cover and pull the jumper off the board. MUCH better as it picks up movement almost instantly. Other than that, does what it needs to do. 
29257 Easy to adjust, easy to wear. 
29258 Great. Does exactly what it s supposed to and seems to be of excellent quality! 
29259 Used it for my wedding and I was thrilled with the results. 
29260 great lens, works as described. 
29261 Works as advertised. Have one in the house and one in the backyard. If anyone enters the garage we are immediately notified. 
29262 Just what I expected! 
29263 Does what is advertised. Very comfortable handle and easy to use mounting equipment 
29264 Recently received, It appears a sturdy, well made monopod. Just purchased a ball head for it, 
29265 Works great for all 4 of my bodies with a 70-200 (hood reversed), but grip will not fit. 
29266 excellent! 
29267 You will not be able to fit it in any case. more importantly, the flash will leave a dark mark where this large protrusion interferes with the flash. 
29268 works ok for my simple needs. 
29269 Non standard PoE and not advertised in the description of the product: it does not come with its own power supply and PoE injector and Samsung tries to sell its own solution with a recorder that costs a lot and has oownly 4 Ethernet imput adding 4 analog inputs 
29270 Wow amazing camera, great quality. 
29271 Perfect bag for the camera and accessory, great value and quality. 
29272 Damn this camera is the s***. Buy one. 
29273 The include foam breaks on in 1/2 inch squares allowing a perfect fit. I fit my Nikon D70, 2 standard lens and a 600 zoom along with my GoPro. 
29274 Works flawlessly. 
29275 Perfect for the small underwater camera, quick delivery, thanks! 
29276 excellent batteries 
29277 All good made it a great trip 
29278 DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT if you plan on using this in the ocean. I got this for bodysurfing and the camera snapped off the base almost immediately. My GoPro belongs to Mother Ocean now. And no....the waves were small - about 1.5 feet. 
29279 Good. 
29280 Not too much to say. It works perfectly, no sizing issues or difficulty putting on / taking off my camera. 
29281 arrived promptly and as promised, thank you 
29282 TERRIBLE SERVICE from the Seller. product broke in 2 months and no one will help replace. Not the seller and NOT HP. TERRIBLE al around. 
29283 The mount works nicely on most flashlights but ocassionally, the flashlight tends to drop on the floor during the middle of the ride due to the clamp doesn t have a top locking mechanism. It just had a half grip to hold your flashlights. 
29284 Great product. Works as described. Great service after the sale. 
29285 works well with a speedlite flash 
29286 Really good but I don t think it s $1000 good Returned and bought em5 mkii instead. Much happier 
29287 Good product. Work as expected. 
29288 Works. 
29289 Use it all the time and takes great shots 
29290 This is the best case for my phantom 
29291 Way too bulky. Impossible to go on trip without tripod and without tripod rings. 
29292 After very little use, one of the props continues to spins but without the force behind it to lift properly. 
29293 Gave it as gift for my Brother in law - He LOVES IT!!!! 
29294 Lost the charger for my camera and so happy to find it available on line. It works great and now I can use my camera again. 
29295 Works perfect on my d5300. Wanted a flash to get started with and its perfect for learning. Get the remotes too! 
29296 My wife LOVES them! They work great - better than we even expected! 
29297 for an LED light it takes a lot of batteries but it produces plenty of light. 
29298 Arrived after I left for vacation. didn t do any good setting on back porch. 
29299 arrived and in all working order good to go the batteries are heavy and you ll need to make a bace for them when charging but thats it 
29300 Simple to set up .Works great ! Thank you 
29301 Price was also great 
29302 Very satisfied 
29303 Amazing product 
29304 It worked out fine. 
29305 everything was great but the camera settings won t change kinda of a bummer.. 
29306 Fits my Nikon Coolpix P530 perfectly and should fit all similar cameras. It s attractive looking and feels very well made. Very happy with my purchase, especially for the price. 
29307 Lightweight and compact. An excellent tripod for hikes and for backup. 
29308 Sold material works very well. I am using this to mount my H4N on my DSLR 
29309 this was exactly what I needed! 
29310 Worked just fine 
29311 Perfect match for my Sony camera. 
29312 Great little camera. Comes in handy when hooking up my boat trailer too. 
29313 Works well with the mobile app and easy to set up using the mobile app. However, I have yet to actually set up the camera because the detailed setup is way too confusing and difficult. The mobile app is good for basic features. 
29314 It was a little smaller than we anticipated but otherwise we are very happy with it. 
29315 Great Charger! I like the way it lets you know on the screen what is happening during the charge process. 
29316 Ordered this a week before a trip to Chicago. Not only did I receive it in time, but it fit and worked perfectly. 
29317 No comments 
29318 great. 
29319 Very happy 
29320 I really like this lens. It comes in a soft Pentax pouch. 
29321 It is exactly what I ordered and exactly what I needed. No problems! Works perfectly! 
29322 Works OK 
29323 Horrible!!! Do not buy!!! I used it twice and on the second use it blew a fuse, caused sparks to fly, and fried the cord... & a clients floor... Also the product is made cheaply 
29324 It s all all right!! 
29325 I am completely satisfied with this camera. I haven t had any problems. 
29326 A bit too small, even for my small camcorder ... but well made and designed. 
29327 Perfect! 
29328 Excellent Product! 
29329 They are best battery I ve ever used very good product don t mess with the rest 
29330 It never worked. 
29331 Arrived before I expected it and was fully charged out of the box, unlike the fuji battery that came with the camera. 
29332 The poor quality of this tripod was immediately apparent. Plastic, lightweight, I m not sure how it stands to support anyone s camera, but it was definitely not suitable for mine. 
29333 A++++ 
29334 It was easy to replace the old DVR with this one. Very straightforward to setup and access via the mobile apps. 
29335 Great 
29336 Took it with me to Yellowstone. Comfortable enough, and I liked all the different ways to get into the bag. I m a little concerned about the durability of the zippers. Had just the right amount of space for my regular lense, my telephoto and some extra things. 
29337 Just what it said it was. 
29338 I use it for outdoor work, good 
29339 Works like a charm! 
29340 Works great. 
29341 better than i expected. 
29342 This works great. I had to purchase this because I lost the cord for my camera. Now I can upload everything I want. 
29343 So easy to use and install. I love that I can check on the house while I am away. The picture is great too! 
29344 Great product, easy to use with my iPhone and my iPad. Quick shipping is a bonus!! 
29345 Works with my Sony camcorder however DOES NOT work with my Canon Rebel T1i. The Canon does not have the second hole on the bottom to attach it to the tripod base :( 
29346 Good package deal! The camera is very good and have been getting great results so far. 
29347 Arrived very quick. I love how pictures are capture. 
29348 Just the right size for &#34;Grab n Go&#34;. 
29349 This tripod is great for run and gun , the only issues are the legs , after the 4th time i used it the lega became loose , maybe the item that i got is bad , other than that run and gun shoulder stablizer was amazing 
29350 Excelente. 
29351 These are the best deals on security cameras I have came across. They work just as well as the high price cameras. They are weather proof. The IR s work great in total darkness and they have a wide angle lens that covers a larger area. A GREAT DEAL.... 
29352 Use this while on vacation. Could have one battery in the camera and the other one in the charger 
29353 Excellent product 
29354 Love this bad so far. Wish there was a few extra small zippered pockets to keep some smaller accessories separate, but all in all its been a great bag so far. 
29355 Perfect, no need to purchase a light stand when I have extra tripods! 
29356 Love it. easy to setup. Takes a bit to get used to the navigation. Wife loves it. She can fast forward thru the commercials. Worth every penny. 
29357 very lightweight and easy to carry. well done. 
29358 okay 
29359 Wonderful 
29360 A really fine focuser. Built well, heavy duty, very smooth and powerful. A worthy upgrade for a fine telescope. 
29361 pretty good camera, had it for 6-7 months and a camera has already gone bad. but pretty good picture. You want know who robbed you, but that you got robbed! 
29362 Fantastic little monitor!!! You simply can t beat the quality and features at this price range. Wish it had SDI IN/OUT and HDMI out, but come on... for $139... this IPS monitor is AMAZING!!! I promise you wont regret it! 
29363 This Kit is awesome, Worth every penny, It has all that you need to clean the sensitive parts of your camera. I love it. 
29364 The video is blurry and unable to capture license plate numbers. I guess you get what you pay for. I will be buying a better one. Sounds are good. The video gets distorted when it gets too hot. 
29365 A high quality product. 
29366 was a gift. Very well received. 
29367 Great Product! 
29368 Friend went through. 3 batteries before I went through one with this 
29369 A quality piece of equipment. It fits well and is well made. The extra quarter inch added to the bottom of my Sony a7mk2 makes it easier to hold. Combine that with the ease of using the arca swiss style plate and it is a win, win. 
29370 Great product, great price 
29371 The remote works well but their is no bag that comes with it for protection. 
29372 Not an infrared filter - it is a neutral density filter - you can see light through the filter 
29373 Great Product 
29374 The camera is too &#34;smart&#34; constantly adjusting...I need to read and look up youtube demos. Some of the flash photos have a bit of red in the color. It is heaver than expected and cannot be concealed at concerts...OK (sue me) anyway the dog doesn t mind the flash. 
29375 Works great! 
29376 Works great! And very economical. 
29377 They fit like a charm! 
29378 The camera was all that I expected and more. I m very pleased with this product. 
29379 junk 
29380 I liked the product 
29381 I got this for my 9 and 13 year old boys. They love it! Took a few tries to figure out how to fly it, but once they got the hang of it, it is great. Just make sure you go to an open field. 
29382 Does not fit the GPH4B perfectly, it s a bit loose. 
29383 Loved it, great condition, excellent pics, better than Nikon 200 
29384 Very helpful!!! 
29385 Great for everyday use, pictures are not as crisp as what I am used to. Good value, if you want great photos, spend more. 
29386 Exactly what I wanted perfect and for the price 
29387 This charger never gave me any issues, and did just what it was supposed to do: Charge batteries. Even though it s not an &#34;official&#34; Song charger, it still works perfectly. 
29388 It was good... until I dove just below the surface of the water... then it leaked 
29389 useless 
29390 Works great for our Nikon camera! 
29391 This lens fits perfectly with my Sony A5100 camera. The pictures are crystal clear. Totally worth it for the price! 
29392 not good spend more and get something stronger 
29393 Great quality adapter ring screws smoothly no binding onto camera lens and filters.Fast shipping too thanks Goja. 
29394 It worked fine 
29395 perfect camera if your into the outdoors and are hard on cameras. has never let me down ... even with underwater pictures 
29396 Extremely surprised - super great sound quality. Appears is little cheap (pastic wise), but does the job. Used them on my Canon 70D. Picks up great sounds from the back of an auditorium (80-100ft). 
29397 Works as advertised. Charged up my batteries for my range finder. 
29398 Great replacement. 
29399 Its a bit darker, but not enough to offset how helpful this focusing screen really is. Recommended for anyone with fast glass. 
29400 Works as advertised 
29401 Could not get to work with Mac edited images. Returned 
29402 Works on iPhones, cameras & small animals!!! I have even used it to read books. ymmv 
29403 just too light to be useful - going to return mine 
29404 meh. My older coolpix took nicer pictures. was really hard to figure out how to connect to my phone. returned it. 
29405 I m sure this is a fine product, but could never get it to transfer images from my camera. Remote control worked okay, but never transfer. 
29406 Well made perfect fit, looks like it belongs with the camera. Saved me from hitting buttons while holding the camera. And made my grip better. Love the material, aircraft quality machining. 
29407 Worked as expected. Charged batteries without issue. Only thing I did not l like is that the plug is attached to the unit. Not on a cable. This made it problematic with multiple charging units on wall outlets and strips. Other than that, it is a good purchase. 
29408 I go through lots of these it seems 
29409 excellent 
29410 Everything is good and just wish the recording resolution is bit higher than 480. 
29411 Top choice 
29412 At random, the system would restart or get stuck for no reason. Other than that, the unit is OK for the price. 
29413 Don t be fooled. The color is florescent pink, but its not florescent at all. Impossible to see with full blackout on stage. Unfortunately, this is of no use to me. 
29414 Works as advertised, looks good, feels good. glad I could use this on my A580 instead of the big expensive unit Sony says is needed. 
29415 I m in the installation task and adjusting the wi fi configuration. 
29416 Everything I needed and more for all my small cameras! 
29417 Great little case well made overall! I will be buying a larger version very soon 
29418 This is the tripod I ve been looking at. 
29419 Good hood for the money. The clasping system is very cheesy in my opinion however that is not their fault that canon made that bad call. If it had the flocking is give it 5stars but overall nice for the money! 
29420 Really good pictures for a small inexpensive camera. Nice size when traveling and want to take a lot of pictures and not use I-Phone 
29421 Good. Just what expected. 
29422 easy to set up like all Nest items but I wish you could move the camera remotely. 
29423 Amazing and funny toy. Excelent for beginners. 
29424 An excellent buy! 
29425 I have taken this camera just about everywhere so far. The ocean, mountain biking, on roller coasters, and hiking. I even mounted it on the side of my speed skates for a pretty cool angle. I m very pleased with the outcome, and the cost was great. well worth it. 
29426 Thanks. This will be my extra battery. 
29427 Good bag, but after owning for awhile the velcro attached to the straps ruined any shirt I had on. Was not noticeable at the time, until it ruined a sweater to the point that I no longer wore it. 
29428 Don t work well 
29429 Worked just as well as the original, and having the travel charger was great. 
29430 Great Item! Would buy again. Did not disappoint. 
29431 Was exactly the camera I was looking for as a gift for my granddaughter for her birthday. Great size and weight for a 10 year old. Easy for her to use. 
29432 Ordered this to fit my binoculars. Great product, very thick foamy material on the strap. Easily hooks to camera. Feels very secure. You shouldn t be anything but satisfied with this, if it s what you are looking for. 
29433 NEEED MY MONEY BACK!!!! thanks 
29434 great seller - delivered as promised! 
29435 Very impressed with the system. Picture quality was more than expected, set up was fairly easier. Love the fact that can link multiple devices and have 24 hours live access at no charge. Very happy. 
29436 Stopped working less than 3 months after purchase. 
29437 Yes this is a very good case but my Nikon D750 did not fit in it. But for my D90 it was perfect. If you want it for D750 or D810 please look for something else. 
29438 No complaints on the quality. I do wish it had more capacity. There s really not enough room for anything more than the basics. Room for extra batteries, a small charger, and touch screen back pack accessory (for hero 4 black) would be nice. 
29439 Great image quality. But i m still using my pen lens for everyday ... size does matter especially in the small mirrorless category. But still it s a great lens. 
29440 Works perfectly! 
29441 The model I received (which might be a fluke) would not even hold my GoPro after I locked into place. I was really disappointed. 
29442 Works great. I used it to look at dates and markings on coins. 
29443 Great motor. It s a bit bigger than regular Nema 23 motor, but hole spacing and sizing and everything, fits everything made for Nema 23. It is also much stronger than any Nema 23 motor that you can get and can be wired to be parallel or serial. 
29444 kenneth was helpful with setting up an external ip address for us to view our camera from a different network. At times it was hard to understand him. But overall it was a positive experience and we were able to set it up successfully. 
29445 Package hot here on time. Love the camera! Great purchase! Thank you. 
29446 Took this little Action Camera with us to Puerto Rico and it worked perfect. I bought the extra battery pack and boy was that handy! I recommend this product for the price and its quality. 
29447 I bought it for my niece she really loved it. Everything work and fit perfect 
29448 not was I was hoping for… 
29449 Does a great job. Easy to set up on my phone too! 
29450 The adhesive is great. They are still on my lens months later. 
29451 Good 
29452 Great product 
29453 Fools everyone. 
29454 Absolutely amazing!! Huge upgrade over my Phantom 2. 
29455 Great filter. Now I can shoot video in sunny condition with low aperture and fixed shutter speed. Good deal! 
29456 Great bargain easy to use, fairly intuitive, but recommend reading the manual first. 
29457 i have an extra battery for gopro now. it works~ 
29458 this was just what my little camera needed to help stabilize it to eliminate blurred photos! 
29459 We attach this to a model rocket, and the audio and video are awesome. 
29460 their perfect 
29461 Thought it was a good value, but to good to be true... pictures not consistently clear and didn t double focal sight. 
29462 it s ok 
29463 Fast delivery. Batteries fit & worked fine in my Nikon S9900 camera. 
29464 and it will hold more that just filters; things like lens caps and body caps; I wish it closed more tightly (the Velcro is not wide enough if the case is not really stuffed full). 
29465 Wasn t sure what to expect because of price, but it really holds a charge. 
29466 Al Was perfect 
29467 Met my expectations and was priced right. 
29468 to small, good golly how did they make it. 
29469 Great selfie stick. very portable and surprisingly sturdy. inexpensive and fashionable. even works on snapchat. 
29470 works woderfuly keeps my Nikon D3200 lens clean 
29471 good product 
29472 Its okay, video looks good in the cam-recorder s screen, But, while seeing in the computer, it is okay, not very good. Picture quality is also pretty ordinary. 
29473 Just what we were looking for. Well satisfied! 
29474 Great Product! Why pay $60 for the Black Rappid when this is the same thing for a fraction of the cost 
29475 The quality of the head strap was great! 
29476 works great and feels sturdy while use in my go pro4 camera 
29477 Great little camera very sharp pictures easy to use 
29478 Great when shooting low to the ground. I use with a baby backdrop stand and an umbrella. Also good for back lighting a backdrop. 
29479 Excelent 
29480 The price is fair and the item is built in pretty strong material. I use it to mount my digital recorder on top of the DSLR. It works fine. 
29481 Camera works. Put it under my garage door opener and now if door is open get constant video. You can turn off too. 
29482 Good dependable power I think a bit over priced. 
29483 dank 
29484 This Brinno camera is outstanding. Many operational choices. Very fast shipping service. Construction is perfect. Well thought out design. 
29485 Does what I expect for a camera at this price point. One heel of a zoom range! Sometimes a little slow focusing in busy areas. Pretty crisp and clear too. 
29486 might need it 
29487 The internal screw terminals allowing an external sensor was a welcome surprise. This should be part of the documentation. I discovered that it worked by testing it. Sensors out in the garage are working well, but needed a repeater. 
29488 These are great batteries. Just what I wanted. 
29489 Not only protects the hot shoe when not in use, but also provdes a convenient spirit level! 
29490 Fast best-of-the-breed telephoto lens. Fantastic pairing with a tc-14e III teleconverter and/or aps-c camera for extra reach. It s big and heavy though but personally I find it manageable. You will get a workout but I m still spry and haven t been hospitalized because of that. 
29491 nice 
29492 great for my river raft trip 
29493 Doesn t do much 
29494 We love our GoPro! This thing is amazing! The editing program is very user friendly as well. I recommend buying some kind of steadying mechanism though... the video will look so much more professional if it s not as shaky. 
29495 Good quality and really amazing 
29496 doesn t go to terribly far but it s lighter then a d celled one 
29497 Looks nice and cool. Seems to be sturdy. Would recommend. 
29498 Had to discover after delivery that this item will not function without buying the additional Capture Camera Clip for 59.95$. Either sell the entire kit in working condition or don t sell at all 
29499 Served the purpose to communicate from the 1st floor to the 2nd floor. No power plug was included so they run on batteries which only last one week. 
29500 Awesome. I live one block from Lake Erie in Ohio. I love all the ways to use my go-pro gear-pro camera. I would highly recommend to take on vacations and adventures. 
29501 Arrived on time and better than expected. Great product when you don’t have three arms. 
29502 Amazing bag- really cant say enough about it. Even let friends borrow it for their Hawaiian honeymoon when they went hiking and they loved it. We used it all of Europe and it was invaluable! My husband felt comfortable wearing it and didnt feel out of place. 
29503 I don t know who comes up with these things. They should go work for Mattel. This thing is a joke! 
29504 Connects with Microsoft LifeCam Studio 1080p HD Webcam (Q2F-00013) 
29505 The telephoto lens works fine but the adapter included in this kit did not fit my G16. The telephoto lens does however fit a real Canon LA-DC58L lens adapter. Since I really bought this for the lens I m satisfied with this purchase. 
29506 It was a steal. I shoot music videos with it. I shoot events. Its great i just need extra batteries. 
29507 These batteries are added to my growing collection of LP-E6 s for my 5D and SmallHD monitors. They seem to work as good as my OEM batts as well as my Chili and Wasabi Power batteries. Thanks STK 
29508 Everything worked as described. The charger was slower than I expected, but it did charge the batteries completely. 
29509 The batteries are great and the delivery was earlier than promised or expected. All together a great experience for me with Amazon! 
29510 Great product and a good quality for how cheap it is! 
29511 Received as expected and works great on my Nikon D5000. Slipped on easily and is very comfortable to use. Great product so and I would definitely order this again! 
29512 Great 
29513 Worked well give it 5 stars 
29514 just because I ordered to a European address didn t mean I wanted the Eruo plug... super inconvenient since I m not even in Europe any more. 
29515 good little lamps 
29516 Henry was absolutely wonderful! He totally got both of my cameras set up. I didn t have to really do anything, whioch was great being I do not understand a lot about computers. Thank you again Henry! 
29517 I have old Nikon and new Panasonic. Went on trip to Alaska. Held batter charger and batteries and san discs. 
29518 Perfect 
29519 This external viewfinder actually works quite well, but it s prone to breakage since it s dangling off of the camera. Also, for $250, I would recommend just getting the newer Sony A6000 or NEX 6 that both have viewfinders. 
29520 favorite black and white film 
29521 No quality control at all! :( - Monopod sections don t lock, so camera flops down, rotates with gravity. - One of the lens adapters doesn t thread properly - Remote doesn t work (Even tried a fresh battery) 
29522 User friendly, crisp imagery, good battery life. 
29523 Great product and fast shipping. Just as described. Thank you! 
29524 Works fine for just a hint of extra lighting or if used as backlighting, but makes VERY LITTLE difference. Get something a little stronger. 
29525 The batteries do not hold a charge. We charged them for 24 hours before using them and they lasted less than 20 minutes. 
29526 I had some difficulty setting up external access from the web, BUT I called the Foscam tech support people and spoke to a gentleman named Edward, and he fixed me up in under 5 minutes. so far so good. great resolution on this camera 
29527 Love this case, came as shown in picture. The foam was easy to remove and everything fits snug. 
29528 I didn t make note of the three inch size when I purchased them. They are really little! 
29529 I love this bag!! perfect size and looks more expensive than what I paid :) 
29530 Love it. 
29531 good price and product. 
29532 My 15 year old loves this camera. The film is very expensive, but it is a very fun camera she uses with her friends. 
29533 Great film. Enlarged one of my Ektar negatives to 20x20. Looks fantastic on my wall, professionally framed. Amazing skin tone quality. 
29534 Good price. 
29535 Don t be fooled because this is a third-party brand; this is an outstanding lens! I used it on my Canon 7D. It s manual, but don t be scared of that. It produces some great images and the 8mm is perfect for crop sensor bodies. 
29536 as expected 
29537 Great features, Love the ease of use, Got this for a parent that s not super tech savvy and the fact that there s a button for taking pictures and another for recording video is awesome! 
29538 Do not buy. Accessories are not as per the details provided. And after sales experience is also bad. 
29539 nice adapter now I can use all my Nikon lenses on my Sony vg10 
29540 Did NOT fit my camera 
29541 very pleased with it all! 
29542 Love it! So much for a great price!!! :D So happy!!! 
29543 Not built very well and the tolerances are not great, but you get what you paid for. The item works well enough for me and I am satisfied with it. If you are doing hobby level macro photography, this works just fine. 
29544 If you don t have one of these you need to. i had some stains on my UV filter that lens cloth wont touch. But after useing this pen they where gone. i gave thisitem fivestars. 
29545 Great protection 
29546 Excellent lighting solution for my video game streaming set up! 
29547 I use this w/ a Tascam to record my mando. Rock solid. Finding well-made stuff in the sea of never-ending (cr*p) makes me Happy. 
29548 works great 
29549 Works like original battery in my Minolta digital camera 
29550 I tested this in a pool and no leaks! I was going to use it on a snorkel tour, but it was canceled. Not sure how well it works in deep water 
29551 I really love this lens! 
29552 worked great but now after charging the camera says the batteries are dead. Cannot seem to charge them at all 
29553 Works as described. Easy and the case is very nice 
29554 Just used it on our river trip in Europe and found the settings to be spot on. Threads easily and adjusts smoothly. A good universal fader. 
29555 Broken and not working when it arrived. 
29556 I like it it is working fine 
29557 everything fine. works great. 
29558 Works great, and I especially like the car adapter. 
29559 The order came in record time and was exactly as advertised. The pole looks very well made, with robust aluminum parts and no cheap plastic. Company seemed to take suggestions about its last iteration of this pole to heart and made the lock screw captive. Very pleased so far! 
29560 A cozy but good fit for the Canon SX 50. Room for extra battery and memory cards. 
29561 A relief to find avreplacement that works. Go-Pro was no help and don t support older products! 
29562 same as OEM if u wanna save a few bucks buy em 
29563 Excellent!!! 
29564 Nice kit, I ordered it for the hood. It is good enough and stylish, I like it. Filters are fine and I like the case they came in, very handy and useful. Came fast and well packaged. I recommend this item and the seller. 
29565 This product is good and reliable! Packaging was good! 
29566 Very good enclosure and mount for the Dropcam Pro or NEST camera outside. Just add a Fosmon 10ft Micro USB to USB Flat cable to get under a closed window and you have a perfect installation 
29567 We used these for our wedding guests to take selfies at the wedding reception. You have to find a place who will develop these and they have to be sent away for processing. We loved the idea and it was fun! 
29568 Outstanding Item and fast shipping. 
29569 Worked fine, though I never did figure out how to use the dividers. In the end it met my needs to have a sturdy, safe way to store and transport my family s collection of slides from the 1950 s-1970 s. 
29570 was a gift. no complaints so far. 
29571 Battery hold a great charge! Good value and well built. 
29572 So far so good! Still can t believe the price for this bundle. Looking forward to diving more into this product. 
29573 Met every expectation 
29574 Seems just fine. No problem, no regrets. Good value. 
29575 Package arrived on time as promised. Batteries did not last as long as original GoPro battery. One battery worked once and then would not charge again. Package returned. 
29576 great price and works great 
29577 The battery gets discharged completely if left in the camera overnight. It recharges fine and it says it s 100%, but doesn t hold the charge at all. I have Canon and STP brands also and they work fine. Total waste of money. 
29578 Great size & colors that won t get lost in the bottom of your bag! 
29579 very compact and easy to use. 
29580 I haven t cracked the code of shooting with a white background yet. Everything turns out gray unless it s essentially over exposed. That said, this is a decent little setup for occasional use. 
29581 Easy to setup. Mydlink works great on Android. BUT The picture quality is way below expected. I increased the resolution which helped, but nothing was ever in perfect focus at any distance or lighting. Disappointed 
29582 buy it, strap and brackets work well 
29583 Its ok but hard to set up 
29584 Very well made. I used a youtube video to get it on my camera, which I recommend because if you put the strap on wrong it can come off and your camera can break. This strap is very solid and the pattern is beautiful. 
29585 Make sure to pick up the right SD card for best performance 
29586 great product thank you 
29587 Worked well but after a couple weeks the app is not working so I can view on my phone! I am pretty angry cause I can t get it to work. The cameras work fine and do their job. App sucks. 
29588 AMAZING!! There isn t one thing in here that I have a complaint about!!! All of it worked awesomely, is durable, and I have yet to have a problem with any of it. Plan to buy two more for Christmas gifts! 
29589 Richard Helped me the reest of the way the cameras aree great and the wireless distance in my case is excelllent aso have utdoors wide excuse me i have treemors 
29590 Worked like new. 
29591 Works nicely love it! Picked it over the Dropcam. Very happy used it for a few months now. 
29592 Everything came as described. The cleaning pen works very well. Plus you can never have too many microfiber cloths 
29593 Shipping is fast and quality is good 
29594 Very nice filter. Slim profile and machined very well. 
29595 Haven t tested it out yet but it is obviously made of high quality materials! 
29596 I like it! 
29597 used this in the ocean with my go pro and it worked great 
29598 Great mount, aggressive price. 
29599 Too big for bikes or motorcycles 
29600 great! 
29601 This was a real surprise. It was a cheap gag stocking stuffer gift for my wife. The gag was on me. We have used our GoPro soo much more with this than ever before. Definitely worth the price and convenience. 
29602 as described 
29603 Seemed like a good product. I just wanted more of a walkie talkie so I could use inside unite anywhere in my house. Seller was very good about saying they would give me a refund. 
29604 Awesome. If I ever need a part I will definitely use them again 
29605 Was a gift for my daughter and she really likes it...she used to have the same one that her son drop by mistake inside the water.... it became a perfect gift for her :) 
29606 Minimal design, Solid construction. Needed to mount my monitor on to my gimbal. Works great 
29607 Our dial was broken but we did not get a chance to return it before the 30-day window. Luckily, the manufacturer fixed it under warranty it just took a while. 
29608 These are visitor brand batteries at a Bargain price as far as I can see. Basically getting three for the cost of one fuji battery. Came well Packaged and Fully charged. Superfast service. Highly reccomended 
29609 heck ya 
29610 This filter is superb, use it all the time when traveling especially 
29611 As described, great Product. 
29612 It s great to have an external charger and extra batteries. They save a lot of fusle. 
29613 Is ok 
29614 good quality. 
29615 Great case 
29616 Just like the original! 
29617 This was perfect for a trip I just did to Nicaragua. It helped me to have great pictures and not having to worry about my camera. 
29618 This case is the perfect fit for my DJI Phantom3! Plenty of room for all accessories including my ipad! It keeps everything firmly in place and can be adapted to almost any accessory that you might have. The wheels and handle are rugged and store away nicely for travel. 
29619 Works well 
29620 Henry 
29621 Very good quality and fun to use As described, easy to use, bluetooth paired without problems with my samsung. Good quality design, the phone holder grips the phone securely, when unextended its like the size of a normal umbrella, fits into the handbag. Worth every penny, no regrets. 
29622 shorter than expected, but I ve heard it s all about how you use it and size isn t necessarily everything... 
29623 Cheap plastic lenses, scratch easily... Shade limits photo area & casts shadows at certain angles 
29624 Have been using this for a long time now. Works great. Always keep extra batteries available when on vacation. 
29625 fake 
29626 Good value and easy to set up 
29627 I haven t actually testing this under water, but I m happy with it. It s just what the description says it is. 
29628 excellent 
29629 I finally received my order I believe it was lost in transit. I have used a product and it is like magic 
29630 Great product, well built, easy to use, delivered on time. 
29631 Nice case 
29632 Yep! It works! 
29633 The cold shoes are milled wrong and will not accept a flash shoe. 
29634 Flimsy and poorly crafted. Strap broke in 3 days. Stitching started to come apart after 6 days. Stay away! 
29635 field of view small. recordings will not play back on mac or pc. 
29636 VERY cute film!! I m definitely looking forward to using it as it is definitely one of those &#34;here&#34; moments for your fujifilm. I will treasure it and it came very fast and securely packaged! Would order again! 
29637 As described. 
29638 Nice case - covers lower body and easy to take on and off - looks good. Has little door on side to open for access to USB. One drawback which others have mentioned is to change battery or get access to SD card you must remove the case. 
29639 It would have been better if it could charge from USB port. But overall it is pretty good price and quality for two battaries. 
29640 This camera is everything I wanted, except the battery doesn t last as long as I would like. This is great for sports pictures, they came out crystal clear, love it. 
29641 Very nice strap, I have a full frame DSLR and been wanting a different strap but didn t like the ones that connect to the tripod mount. I saw another photographer with one of these and he liked it and I really like it also. 
29642 Fantastic strap that really fits. Shot all day, all week and hand rested well when camera hanging down. Room to use index finger on shutter for once. Great device. 
29643 Excelente 
29644 Horrible...replaced the bulb and blew within a week I would not buy this!!! 
29645 Great for that extra camera body so it is ready to go onto your harness. Nice and snug and good firm click when engaged. I do not worry about them coming undone. 
29646 fits loose but it seems ok 
29647 i ll try it later this week. 
29648 Great Product 
29649 good value and works like original 
29650 Terrible &#34;x&#34; banding at darker settings 
29651 works good 
29652 Works great 
29653 Great back up. Holds charge. Similar to original Canon battery. 
29654 Excellent product and great customer service!! The seller worked with me to fix some issues which were caused by me. Highly recommended. 
29655 I didn t even receive the rilakuma film. It was little twin stars. What the heckie! 
29656 I really like these. I ve bought four of them. Their mount is a little bit hokey, but it works, just gotta be careful. can be used on the camera, or hand held. Really very flexible and at a good price. 
29657 Awesome! 
29658 One stopped holding a charge and inflated in size indicating short circuit, the other worked fine 
29659 cheap made 
29660 wrong size for my camera 
29661 Great size pictures for scrap booking 
29662 It is what it is and what it is is fun. 
29663 This product arrived as promised. Everything that was described on the site was delivered. Very satisfied overall 
29664 it worked perfectly for my camera and got here just in time! 
29665 As advertised. 
29666 It holds the microphone. Can still hear shocks though. 
29667 Good product and received it quickly 
29668 Worked perfectly with my camera. 
29669 Obviously not top of the line. But it does the job wonderfully! I used this because I will be upgrading my camera soon and the underwater housing for the camera I will be upgrading to would not fit my camera now. So until then I will use this! 
29670 I can t say if the video quality is good or not because I can t figure out how to work it. The instructions are terrible and don t make any sense. I would love to be able to find a video showing you how to use this. 
29671 Love this camera. Got it for under $100. The red is nice color. Needed wifi camera with 1080p hd video and at least 16mp and this does the job. Bought accessory pack for $20 for case and extra battery. 
29672 Great for pics with baby. Cute 
29673 Nice camera for a decent price. However, I was eager about the wifi automatic uploading function. It is WAYYYY too complicated - I have never gotten it to work, and I am not tech illiterate. 
29674 Not work after two weeks 
29675 It is really good 
29676 as promoised 
29677 wonderful and easy camera to understand and use. 
29678 its a case ? 
29679 A little bulky 
29680 Super handy. I have to always use them with stage weights or sand bags. The base legs do not spread wide enough considering the giant sail that is attached to them. Very light weight, so treat them gingerly. 
29681 not much room at all 
29682 Works great from the moment it arrived which was on time. 
29683 Works Great. Very small and compact, can trigger the camera from the front, or from the back of the IR detector on the camera. Includes 2 buttons - one for focus and shutter release and the other is for a 2 sec delay. Tested range - 3m. 
29684 Wonderful camera and you get sooooo much with it for the price! Love it! Perfect for beginner or intermediate photographers! 
29685 Not gopro brand but high quality none the the less, great product for the price 
29686 Great quality. Not a huge fan of the fish eye but was expected with wide angle lens. 
29687 Novelty camera, photos are small and washed out. Don,t waste your money 
29688 As an amateur, i found this camera excellent, easy to operate, realistic colors and the build quality is very sturdy as you expect in a product like this. Lens upgrade is a must, the default lens is a bit poor in zoom in my opinion. 
29689 Worked great for my application. I m very pleased. Plugs into mic input for DSLR camera. Works for computer and iPad also. 
29690 Dove with these about 8 times up to 65 feet and had no fogging problems. I also used a stock gopro 1 and had no leaks, did not use any special dive case. 
29691 To expensive 
29692 Easy to use, lightweight and compact and came with all the accessories I needed. Shipping was quick! 
29693 The eye cup is too big for the Nikon D7100. It s loose and the right side partially blocks the diopter. 
29694 Batteries work great in my night vision scope... 
29695 Two stars 
29696 In the day its a wide clear color view... at night its clear black and white in the pitch dark :) 
29697 really surprising 
29698 I haven t used it yet, saving it for my cruise in October, but my camera fits nicely into this pouch, and it s triple sealed so you camera won t get wet. 
29699 Description is deceiving it states, &#34;higher quality video than what is provided through cable and satellite operators,&#34; which leads you to believe it can work with Cable or satellite TV and it does not. 
29700 As described 
29701 Works fine 
29702 Work like a charm, dusts on sensor of my Nikon D7000 were cleaned, thanks 
29703 This should hold my 15 x 56 binoculars steady. 
29704 A security camera has no Audio!! Whats the $190 for ?! that was the worse purchase I made within years. On top of that there at least couple of seconds delay. Non of these is acceptable for security camera, garbage! 
29705 THIS WORKS LIKE A FRONT LENS CAP SHOULD!!! WHOa !!!1! 
29706 Good product for the price; but doesnt feel it s going to be durable... screws seem they will break with use after a few months...let s see... 
29707 Excellent 
29708 Work just fine. No surprises 
29709 nice item, works well on my bag 
29710 Good protection at a decent price. 
29711 Arrived as described and on time. Thanks 
29712 Not the highest quality build that you have ever seen but it does what it needs to do and does it pretty well actually. It has very bright lights and takes double A batteries and it does last a pretty long time. So pretty good purchase made here! 
29713 not very sturdy. recommended to spend extra money on the actual stick from GoPro 
29714 We love this. It makes the target you are shooting about 100 yards closer. 
29715 Excellent 
29716 Essential equipment for all photographers can t wait to give it a try. Especially for night and tripod shooting. 
29717 I bought this lens for astrophotography. I tried on a clear night in a place away from city lights. The results met my expectations. I recommend this lens to anyone starting in astrophotography with a DSRL. 
29718 Just what I needed. Thanks 
29719 Great tripod. Grips to anything. Small and compact. Very easy to use. 
29720 Awesome camera, setup was a snap! 
29721 Awesome video quality, light weight and small in size. Perfect for my 250 quad build. Will do business with again 
29722 Thanks! 
29723 Received these and have charged them up, work fine, thanks much. 
29724 Excellent product. Works great. I couldn t get all the features to work at the beginning. Called customers support and spoke with Calvin, everything working perfectly now. He helped me set up the Wireless and the Laptop support. One of the best technical support calls I ever had. 
29725 this is a very good flash, it won t disappoint you 
29726 Genuine Pentax batteries are the *best!* The shooting time I get with a genuine battery is 10 times longer than a non-Pentax brand, and the battery retains most of its charge after long periods of storage. Highly recommended! 
29727 Bought one for me and as a gift for a friend. Trust putting my d-800 on it with a small lens. Great for the price. 
29728 Everything works perfectly and for much less cost. The Sony has smaller batteries so you must have one or two on hand when you go out. This really fills the bill. 
29729 No what I expected:( 
29730 I love them! They were cheap and good products. At first it only shipped one so I contacted the seller and he automatically sent the other one. I got the other one about a week later. :) 
29731 Great product and allowed an easy installation of my Security Camera System. 
29732 Great value 
29733 really nice and conpact 
29734 It works great just as stated. Veto is very clear and night pictures are great. 
29735 I use this to mate a Nikon D3100 to the Meade ETX 125EC, still requires T-mount that &#34;clicks&#34; into the camera 
29736 Excellent 
29737 Haven t seen the Canon version, but it can t be much higher quality than this one. 
29738 Did not fit our Canon camera as described. Returned for refund. 
29739 Works perfectly with no issues. 
29740 This case is a snug fit for the Sony Nex-6 with a compact kit lens installed. 
29741 has rust which tells me it obviously got wet at some point, though it does work (but for how long) 
29742 These cloths have been invaluable for getting my glasses clean. No cleaner necessary, just a few rubs and I can see again clearly. 
29743 Best new toy! 
29744 Received as expected 
29745 Good price, and good quality. 
29746 Works as advertised. 
29747 Great little flash for the price. 
29748 Super cute. Goes well with my camera and I just love it! 
29749 works fine. 
29750 Everything you need to start capturing the best moments. Love the fact that everything was in perfect condition. I m really enjoying my camera. Even though it s a refurbished, you won t notice it. Because it performance is the same as the new one. 
29751 great circular polarizer, fits my 52 mm lens, does a good job in various light settings, makes the colors look so vibrant and nice, particularly the sky when i take landscape shots! 
29752 When used with various Lowepro bags this is a great way to distribute weight and reduce the strain on my shoulders (already an issue with two Nikon DSLRs). 
29753 price is good but its very cheap made and cant adjust levels on the leg 
29754 The quality of this I thought was going to be cheep. I was surprised very sturdy well worth the money! 
29755 very light but stable 
29756 Definitely love my Polaroid! Film is a little expensive but it is so much fun and in good shape. 
29757 Wow. these actually work. I thought for the price they would be half azzed. Can play music, record video, charge thru your PC. If you ride a motorcycle they can be indispensable. 
29758 Very very sturdy tripod, I can feel it immediately when I hold it in my hand. All the locks lock in very steady. And the monopod function is very nice too. Generally a very good buy! 
29759 Great Camera. Crystal clear and very vivid picture. Love it. 
29760 Don t come close to fitting around my 62mm filter. Waste of money. 
29761 good to observe Moon only.. not good for even... Mars and Venus. 
29762 Works and fast shipping! 
29763 The filters work well well for the price. 
29764 gave as part of gift bag for someone with new Go Pro and they loved it! 
29765 Does fit over case of my I phone but not stable easily dislocated Has typical fish eye distortion as expected 
29766 GoPro products are such good quality. This clamp is very strong and I would trust my GoPro clamped to anything with this mount. 
29767 One camera came broken and the other two they drain brand new batteries in less than 24 hours 
29768 Large enough to fit all my components and to travel with , made very well, I would definitely recommend this for the GoPro 
29769 Although it is said to be the h4 3d gimbal, the computer software recognized it as an h3 3d....? Flew great but due to software issues I returned for a full refund. 
29770 Works very well on my camera. 
29771 This is pretty poorly constructed and doesn t really match the camera at all. I ended up returning it and buying the genuine Panasonic part (which is much better). 
29772 I can t get it to work and I threw away the paperwork - so I cannot return it. 
29773 Perfect camera for my quad. Simple and easy to install. 
29774 works great 
29775 Exactly what I needed to complete installation 
29776 It works very well. Ken Wolf 
29777 This lens came well packaged. So far it has performed well 
29778 The bundle work awesome, the stick are very steady and not slippery at all especially I use it to do Tough Mudder..and the boater work wonder since I dropped my go pro couple times in the water during the obstacles. 
29779 Great lighting kit. Everything described perfectly. I actually received an extra Sandbag that was not listed but love it since it helps to hold down the hair light. 
29780 Just what I needed the battery that comes with the camera does not have near enough power the handle an hour of recording time. I recorded about an hour and a half and the battery was still at about 75 percent charge 
29781 Doesn t last as long as a GoPro brand battery but pretty close. But they are totally worth it for the price. Fit perfectly in the gopro 
29782 We bought this for our Nikon Waterproof Coolpix camera. It s a perfect fit with enough room for the charger and wire! Great quality and light weight. Definitely worth the price! 
29783 Very cool 
29784 Love this looks real. keeps people on their toes. 
29785 Great cameras, fantastic value 
29786 Got the battery, charged it, and it is working perfectly. Fact that I have two batteries makes it better!! 
29787 I haven t been able to try it yet but I think it will be awesome. 
29788 Awesome camera. Loved it 
29789 Inexpensive, a terrific buy! 
29790 Camera freezes, we tried it for backing up our 5th wheel but the camera would either be black or freeze up. It was working for just connecting the hitch but now it is freezing up on that too. Very disappointed after reading all the good reviews. 
29791 Dark filter works as it should, but polarizing filter is not impressive at all. My honest opinion - isn t worth the money. 
29792 Does the job thank you !!!!!!!! 
29793 Nice little camera for the money- I may buy more 
29794 I like it, it s well made all metal. 
29795 Really love using these polaroids in lieu of traditional photos as they add more of an artistic touch to the photos! I would definitely recommend this! 
29796 Lobe this camera! If you wanna have fun with photos this is the product for you. 
29797 this does not charge from the sun, but will charge from electrical. it will not charge my phone at all. 
29798 VERY NICE THANKS GUYS !! 
29799 Almost worthless. Customer support is useless. I cannot get my computer to recognize the sd card to view the files. CS was unable to help me and offered no solutions. Save your money on this product. It does not work as advertised. 
29800 Works well; strong glue. 
29801 Extra batteries are great, charger is super fast! Although that mini tripod can barely hold up any weight.. doesn t stand a chance to hold up my Nikon D5300 (36.5oz ~2.3lbs!) 
29802 Good 
29803 excellent 
29804 It s a piece of junk. Haven t been able to contact the seller to retire this junk so I m stuck with it. 
29805 I love that I can bend the tripod to fit where ever I need it to be, used it on a TV, on a shelf. and on my arm! 
29806 Love it! perfect for monitoring my house!! 
29807 so far good kit, just learning it. will follow up soon. 
29808 I bought this originally to hold me over until I could afford the Money Maker from Holdfast. But after 12 weddings in the 2-3 months.....I m not sure I need the Holdfast. Granted it looks awesome....but is it worth $200 more than this??? I m just not sure. 
29809 Excellent. Wors as advertised, and the price can not be beat. 
29810 Looks real and the motion sensor works up to long distances triggering blinking red light. Great deterrent-very happy! 
29811 Works fine as a back-up battery for the camera. 
29812 Hold up as well as the name brand cannon ones I have. Great battery! 
29813 great battery, I have many older cameras and this works great 
29814 I bought this for my Nikon D7100. I love it, light weight and durable. 
29815 Hi,the quality is not good. After 3 times the screw was broken, my new flash has been dropped and he has had damage! Don t buy this product! 
29816 very nice 
29817 So cute!!! Love it! And the delivery speed is very impressive! I ordered at noon and received it the same night! 
29818 Did not charge my Sony battery or battery it came with!!!! 
29819 Nice Props....no problem at all after 16 flights. Recommend to get prop guards also. 
29820 Purchased two of these monitors and was very pleased in the ease of setting up. Now all my family members want one. 
29821 Item was broken on arrival. 
29822 I really did not know what to expect. But this little light weight tripod is great! I like that the legs extend if needed. 
29823 Product arrived on time and was as described. Perfect condition. Thank you ;-) 
29824 They re ok.They get the job done but just get a real sensor. 
29825 This product looked lioke and advertised to be a two lens case. It is not! only one lens fits into the case when it is closed. 
29826 Exceptionally clear and crisp for a cheap lens. Great depth of field with plenty of bokeh. Nice for DSLR video or pictures. 
29827 very nice quad, realy easy to fly and take videos, even for beginners 
29828 after 3-4 flight the battery connector was melted. (both sides) 
29829 I love my len 
29830 Needed a replacement charger for my video camera and this one really came through for me. 
29831 Perfect! 
29832 Ie worked perfectly with my old camcorder. 
29833 Works just like the GoPro brand name one. Perfectly fine for me. 
29834 awesome selfie stick! 
29835 This product is more than I could have imagined. 
29836 Works as advertized, extreme high qualith cloths 
29837 I could only use autofocus on intelligent automatic. 
29838 I wanted an IR camcorder to do some amature paranormal investigation. For the price you get what you get but that isn t all bad either. I added the Poloroid 36 led IR light and get up to 30ft of lighted distance. 
29839 First time I used it the screen froze. I waited to use it for a vacation and by the time I got back the 30 day return policy had passed. Stuck with a paper weight. 
29840 Great product and arrived on time. The charger works well and the batteries hold a charge at least as well as the much more expensive Canon one, possibly better. I am very happy with this product and look forward to buying from this seller again. 
29841 This fits my Canon Powershot SX10is perfectly. Price is great. Arrived promptly. 
29842 In bought 3 of them and none worked!!!!! 
29843 Fantastic item and very economic. I cannot recommend this enought! I am using it with my Sony A7ii and YN-560 III and RF-603. 
29844 Kenneth helped me to set up all 3 of our Foscam s so we can have security throughout our home. He was very patient and very helpful. Thank you! 
29845 Other reviewers were correct. OK for finding lost change in your sofa. A bit weak for finding anomalies in rifle tubes 
29846 Philips wireless Home Monitor is perfect...It is small in fact tiny and can be put in a inconspicuous area. I love it and it does the trick... I can see who is in my home and see if someone is up to &#34;no-good&#34; Money spent well! 
29847 Just as described 
29848 Works perfectly, just what I needed 
29849 It s good, isn t big enough to get the ring in subjects eyes. But it functions very well. 
29850 I have been a pro photographer for over a decade, why did it take me so long to buy this lens? It s amazingly sharp and contrasty and great for portraits and candids. 
29851 It s Great! Great price and just what I wanted. 
29852 Great working camera. Day/Night mode switch over creates a loud click but works like a charm in night mode. 
29853 Great addition to your camera set. Definitely a great buy. 
29854 Good product 
29855 Great case that protects your camera, is compact enough to fit in a purse and easy access. Love it 
29856 Works well so far. Good price. 
29857 Very cute and worth the price :) 
29858 This is an absolutely necessary accessory to the LX100. The clip-on cap is cumbersome and you will end up losing it. This one is always where you need it. Who needs filters anyway? 
29859 I love this camera! It s so small I can put it anywhere. I love the color of it. The only thing I didn t like was you can t see what you are recording. Other than that it takes great videos and photos. 
29860 Works perfectly on my Sony a5000 camera 
29861 Excellent in every sense 
29862 Out standing clamp, I hem-hawed over the price for a bit, looked at other options. I already owned a Arcatech ball head, the quality is top of the line, made in the U.S. You get what you pay for in life. 
29863 nice item 
29864 Definitely a smart purchase 
29865 it did meet my expectation. very good picture quality, nice camera color and easy to use. 
29866 Yea...this flash is AWESOME! I ve been using a canon 430EX in manual for a while now and I still use this Nissin in manual also (mostly). But the lower profile by itself and easier to use controls just really adds icing on the cake. 
29867 This is one outstanding piece of equipment for the price. 
29868 great camera 
29869 Remote does not have much range to it 
29870 Setup is a little confusing, but once you get past that it works great. Access from my smart phone, tablet and PC. 
29871 Bought for 17 year old daughter birthday. She loves it. Picture quality is great. 
29872 The battery that came with it didn t work. Foto& Tech were quick to reply to my first review. I went to Walmart to get a new battery and it works fine now. 
29873 They work great, shipped fast. Would buy again. 
29874 poor quelity... fair for the price. 
29875 Works great to attach a handle to and is very high quality for the price! 
29876 Great quality sound, can hear voices very well even with a great deal of background noise. Highly reccommend these as a very economical yet very effective means of audio monitoring. 
29877 Great real like it. 
29878 Worked great for me. Did a DSLR video for a big well-known organization using those filters. It worked like a charm. Everybody loved it! 
29879 To lobotomize a drone tie a heavy cord or even a light chain to it. The higher it goes the more weight it is dragging. While debugging your new drone, start in the middle of a field, not in a room. 
29880 Works great. 
29881 cant fault the camera for anything so far. So I should really give 5 stars. However, lack of local storage is a significant drawback. The fifth star lost for lack of local storage possibility. 
29882 Total crap. Bolts didn t reach nuts, cheap cheap construction with no QC. Didn t come close to being worth what I paid. Save your money. and get this instead. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WFN4UIS?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2 
29883 Works great on my Watson Duo Charger. Now I can charge batteries for my X-T1 and 7D at the same time. 
29884 Received as new 
29885 Great! Works perfect for my sony camera 
29886 Was damage when I buy 
29887 Great camera, so great we just ordered another one. Wonderful day image and super clear night image. Our DYI security system works great, especially with our cell phones at work. Great for watching the dogs while we are at work. 
29888 Thank you you were very helpful! Couldn t find the batteries anywhere else! 
29889 Got it and tried right away. Picture was very good using an older SD card. Just ordered the new model of SD and hoping it will be even better. Glad I bought this instead of paying $300-$400 for something else. 
29890 Great. I will buy more 
29891 Thank you, A+ 
29892 Was impressed with the packaging of this product, as well as my camera! 
29893 Gives good battery life and fits perfectly in the Canon SL-1 camera. 
29894 works for me 
29895 B 
29896 Works great and is a must for non-floating cameras. 
29897 Looks decent arrived with one broken bulb and another one flickering like crazy. Reaching out to Seller to see what steps they are taking to rectify. I will write more reviews about that and also the product when I use it. 
29898 Just what I needed for my wide-angle zoom lens. My only concern might be that the fitment to the 35-70 mm lens could have been a little tighter. Otherwise, it works great. 
29899 Love this case. Already have it too full. Looking for next size up. 
29900 Slipped these feet into my Watershot case. iPhone 5c now fits. 
29901 Great product and received as described 
29902 A+ 
29903 The battery was delivered timely. It charged as advertised and seems to be holding it s charge as expected. I ve only had the battery for a month, so it s still working from it s initial charge. I bought it as a backup for a Canon 70D. 
29904 Excelent 
29905 great 
29906 sooo clear in picture and sound... BUMMED it took me this long to buy it! 
29907 it was OK 
29908 These cords work well at a fraction of the Canon price points. 
29909 For an inexpensive lens this is easy to add on and does enhance the distance. 
29910 Easy to use, easy to carry - can hold very large lens and camera and still be very stable - would definitely recommend. 
29911 This was a slight upgrade from my old Canon digital which was misplaced. Really great high res photos in any light. I use it for merchandising online. 
29912 Absolutely love this camera, the white really sets it apart from the typical DSLRs out there. I highly recommend this for any amateur photographer like myself. 
29913 Meet my expectation 
29914 Quick, fast, simple, easy 
29915 The same as the two cameras I had previously. I lost both to water accidents. I bouth another because I like this model. It is small, inexpensive, has a view finder and takes decent photos and videos. 
29916 Junk! Kodak will not support this and the sellers charge a fortune to return plus a restocking fee. My first one completely died after only a year and that was only turning it on during holidays and special occasions. 
29917 must have! 
29918 I ve been using this with both a FL-600r and an FL-50r. It does it s job but overall I much prefer to just use a small softbox for on-camera. I couldn t recommend this for off-camera use either. 
29919 awesome 
29920 Great 
29921 These cloths work amazingly well and the price is right. 
29922 Works good for the price 
29923 Fast shipping, smooth transaction, perfect product Thanks! 
29924 Product is exactly as expected. They are sitting there as spares - hopefully will never need to use them. 
29925 DID WANT WE WANTED IT TO DO 
29926 doesn t havew the strength it needs 
29927 CAMERA IS GREAT FOR THE PRICE , NO PROBLEMS 
29928 This is a great camera. Its worth the cost 
29929 The motor is loud and you can hear some of it on videos. I also do not like how short the battery life is. It does make nice videos otherwise but I would recommend getting a spare battery and external mic. 
29930 Worked has advertised. Was able to take shots of the starts and lightening. That was the whole reason for the purchase. Excellent price, well worth the money. 
29931 Both hoods work very well for my application. I use the retractable hood since I can extent it as needed. I have purchased several products from Gina and have always been happy with my purchses 
29932 Worth every penny, AAA+++ 
29933 very nice! 
29934 Good product, fits perfect on 55/250mm IS STM lens and cheaper than original Canon lens hood. 
29935 I like this a lot but I m not a huge fan of how you strap the tripod on. 
29936 Finally found a good product for safely cleaning my monitors and flatscreen TVs. The spray and magic fiber cloth work well together and get a good streak free clean. I ve got the small magic fiber cloths for my sunglasses etc. Quality product would definitely recommend to everyone. 
29937 Love this bag, great seller 
29938 no good. 
29939 Bought this device to enable me to download images from my camera to my iPhone for sharing. Absolutely easy to install and intuitive to use. Works as advertised for me. 
29940 Supposed to be HD, but it s only low quality SD. Very narrow view lens, can t get much of what you are looking at on the video... maybe somebody s ear, or a blank wall, etc.. 
29941 Batteries worked great with my S32. Two batteries got me through a 14-day backpacking trip, hot and cold temperatures. 
29942 It works 
29943 They do not fit in the camera. I have a canon t5i which it clearly says that they fit, but they do not. They do however fit into my battery grip, but that is not why I bought them! 
29944 Super product 
29945 as advertised 
29946 Hard to remove ! Excellent fit and quality 
29947 Love it. It costs less than my previous camera, which I unfortunately dropped and broke, but this seem to have better features. I just hope I don t drop it again. 
29948 Excellent! 
29949 Purchased 2...easy setup...works great...runs smooth...fast delivery...tech support is there when you need your questions answered...PS LIVE SUPPORT. 
29950 I love this polaroid film. However, the light sensitive layer in one pack arrived damaged and each polaroid in that pack was ruined, which is a bummer since each polaroid costs about $3.00 
29951 fits on my shotgun and my bow. but feels a little flimsy and may easily break 
29952 Fun gimmick, although package arrived damaged on the corner, the lens itself was fine. 
29953 Great! Wouldn t use the selfie stick in water... It rusts in a few hours😂 
29954 I have been wanting a macro ring light for many years. The Canon light was always too expensive for just casual, non-professional use. This one works great, has adapter rings for almost any lens and is so inexpensive, you deserve to try this. I m very happy. 
29955 It doesn t work how can I return 
29956 ok for the money, obviously not even close to the manfrotto version, but it will work.. 
29957 Awesome little kit. I can t think of a single complaint for these. 
29958 Awesome! Vendor great too!!! 
29959 Excellent purchase 
29960 Nice setup, just the car mount alone normally runs about the cost of the full package. 
29961 Use all the time. Do exactly what they are advertised to do. 
29962 Very solid but seems to be easily scratched. Perfect use to build a customizable shoulder rig. 
29963 Already broken but I didn t keep the information to return it. What a disapointment! 
29964 good stuff! 
29965 AVOID this case. It leaked while submerged in 30&#34; of water and ruined my SJCAM. No clue what to do from here. There s something to be said for shopping at actual stores. 
29966 Very good system 
29967 Great little camera for the price!!!!!! I bought this just to keep in my pool bag and it works fine! 
29968 Good tough straps that allow very good length adjustment. They were very close to being exactly what I was looking for. The strap adjustments could be tighter to prevent movement. 
29969 Work perfect and really come in handy when you have the bluetooth running. For sure need to get if you have a gopro 
29970 Excellent package deal. Love this thing. 
29971 focus doesn t work and the flash doesn t woik 
29972 Lets be honest, you re getting what you paid for. Cheap plastic, cheap quality, looks good for decoration at least. 
29973 Fit the case exactly as stated. I didn t have too hard of a time getting the screws in as others have mentioned. Really helped me fit all the smaller camera gear in my case to utilize the most space possible. 
29974 Works well really pleased with the GoPro product line. 
29975 These are amazing!!! I have one on every lens. I will never lose another lens cap again! The adhesive works perfectly. Best deal ever! 
29976 nice item..... 
29977 vintage 
29978 My son loves this camera! 
29979 best strap i ever had. this is way better than those that comes with the camera. this is very comfortable and my camera feels secure. for the price, its no brainer not to get this strap. 
29980 Product didn t work. It kept crashing and was very unstable. When I called for support I spoke to someone in India who eventually ask for access to my computer. Although this may not be unusual I declined. Returned the product. Great disappointment. 
29981 Okay head, had to grind down the screw heads on the base so that the clamp would fit flush. Also, the clamp is okay, but I have to adjust the tension as the size of the Desmond brackets are different than all my other ones. Wouldn t buy again. 
29982 Worked as expected. Car socket adapter made it a plus. 
29983 This product really works. Bought a bunch for me, family and friends. 
29984 Amazon Basics does it again with amazing quality products at an affordable price. I feel like I stole this thing, it is so much better than it s price tag suggests. I can t imagine what more I would want in a tripod. 
29985 As described. Works well. 
29986 The majority of the accessories did not fit my GoPro Hero 4 and I inquired about the issue twice will no answers 
29987 Works as well as the technology permits. 
29988 Works just like the more expensive canon flash. Does what it s made for as long as you know what youre doing. 
29989 dont buy from this buyer even by mistake! product looks worse than a chewed up cellphone! 
29990 gives you all of the cool items for any adventure 
29991 I rarely use it right now, because my mic. Once that is resolved I can use the whole thing. 
29992 Great &#34;old school&#34; type cameras and were fun to bring to an event. 
29993 This was a gift, but my friend seems pretty happy with it. 
29994 It s a great value for a Canon camera, we couldn t be happier. 
29995 I love this little thing. It gets great angles from my gopro and very durable. The only thing I don t understand is the Rope thing that came with it. 
29996 Great product 
29997 Exactly what I wanted! 
29998 Does not sync up to our openers. 
29999 Horrible product and service. 
30000 Had the same problem as others. I plugged in the charger and 30 seconds later I heard a pop. My battery was damaged and the charger no longer worked. 
30001 it work !! 
30002 This does exactly what it s supposed to. I am able to fit my Sony Nex-3n as well as a Kodak Zi8 and extra batteries, cables, and sd cards. For small cameras and accessories this is a great bag. 
30003 Right fit. Lost my original while on vacation. Works great and reasonable priced. 
30004 Good 
30005 I ll try to remember to add to this next year because these are to replace two competitor s batteries that didn t last but about a year. So far these charged up well and seem to hold their charge well. 
30006 Descent. Set up i got what i could afford to learn with. I know its going to be fun either way. 
30007 This viewer worked great for slides that are 60 years plus. 
30008 Very good 
30009 Great housing for the Xiaomi Yi camera. Adds a bit of protection to the unit. Recommend, especially at this price. 
30010 Works great, exactly what I needed at the star party. Best to wait until it is on sale. 
30011 No problems, charges and lasts just like described. 
30012 very grainy picture quality but what do you expect for this price. 
30013 Order more, limited life. 
30014 Works 
30015 It s perfect and wonderful for cutting out glare while looking into the viewfinder. 
30016 Works great for spare batteries for the GoPro. And great price compared to GoPro branded batteries. 
30017 It did what I wanted with the slides, I have yet to try it on my super 8 film and negatives. 
30018 I bought this for my NEX 5 camera to use when we went to Yellowstone this summer. It is a fine lens but it is rather heavy for the camera. However, I am pleased that I had it with me because I got some excellent photos! 
30019 Excellent lens hood at a great price fit perfectly! 
30020 Exceptional product - in fact, I liked it so much I bought another one! Lightning fast shipping. Great experience and would definitely buy from again!!! 
30021 work great best camera at this price. 
30022 too small for my use 
30023 Arrived quickly and was exactly what I needed. 
30024 Horrible back drops. 
30025 Super! 
30026 The clapper had separated from the board during shipping and i had to glue them back together. Other than that the quality seems good and the price is right. 
30027 Received in an appropriate amount of time. Very pleased. 
30028 spend the money and buy the real deal 
30029 as advertised 
30030 Still learning how to use it all. 
30031 It fits ok in general but clutching the stop buttons requieres more handling 
30032 Best birthday present I ever bought myself. I m still learning this camera and have yet to fiddle with each setting; but the photos I have taken with this camera are polished and look fantastic. I love submitting them to photo societies. 
30033 excellent product. it was what I was expecting. 
30034 I bought this camera as a birthday gift for my sister. She absolutely loved it! In the digital age where everything is online she was so excited to have instant &#34;old school&#34; pictures. 
30035 Awesome product and customer service! 
30036 I had one before. I bought one to replace the old one and they work fine. 
30037 Got to love Gopro. I recently lost my old Hero 3 Black, and found this one as cheap as it could get. All items arrived as described, it was just as new. Great Photo and Video quality. 
30038 Works well! 
30039 For the price, this is a decent saddle-bag weight. The material is nylon but appears and feels durable. I placed zip-loc plastic bags inside the compartments of the sand bag then filled those plastic bags with sand. 
30040 Great item. Love using it when we are surfing and also when kayaking and hiking 
30041 Nice blacked out housing 
30042 lenses won t focus - don t waste your money 
30043 Fabulous package with so many accessories in it! Couldn t have asked for more! 
30044 Very, Very Good Camera. Metal casing is heavy, but I shaved most of weight by making a 1/16 inch thick plywood box for it. Now weighs 0.6 oz. 
30045 great 
30046 Great 
30047 Nice. Easy to set up, sturdy, and is a very gracious size. Also, the carrying case is very helpful. 
30048 Like everyone else says, the plastic parts seem weak. But higher priced versions have similar or worse complaints about the same problem. I came back to this one and am pleased that with some care it will stand up to my infrequent needs for a reflector stand. 
30049 Case was well made and fit perfectly. Appreciated the extra thought involved in developing the battery change panel. Surprised with the gift wrist added to the package. 
30050 I purchased this while I was expecting my first baby so I could capture all her firsts 
30051 So simple to use, which was great while I had pregnancy brain! Videos are amazingly crisp and clear and look great on our HDTV! 
30052 More than I expected. Came with car charger and even plug that we used un Iceland. Great value 
30053 Very bad quality products. One mount cracked at 1st time I tried to use. Monopod seems like its gonna break when u extend it. All these cheap chinese stuff. 
30054 The strap started ripping I only had it for a month if that. 
30055 Cute 
30056 Good stuff 
30057 This product needed to be set up with their web site and their link didn t work! Still can t use this product! (Not happy!) :-/ 
30058 I love these accessories for my go pro hero 4 silver, works perfectly and looks so cool :) 
30059 What a tool. this camera rocks. 
30060 Very nice lens and affordable to. helps get that clsoer shot 
30061 ok for the price. It fulfill my basic needs for a monocular 
30062 Lightweight, well built, great optics. Perfect for our Kodiak Brown Bear viewing operation. 
30063 helpful 
30064 Glad to find original Nikkon products 
30065 Excellent!!!! 
30066 Arrived as promised and fits the battery. Haven y used it since the battery arrived already charged. 
30067 TERRIFIC! 
30068 Easy set up, works well, phone app lags a little unless you have 4G but still very useful. would be good if you could adjust the audio notification, motion notification works great. overall a great camera, I will probably get another to monitor another part of the house 
30069 Does exactly what it is supposed to! Very well made metal lens hood. I needed a 62mm wide angle for my 28-80mm vintage zoom lens that works great but is prone to flare. This hood solved the flare problem nicely! 
30070 Surprised the wife and it works great on vacations. 
30071 Love my new Fugi! 
30072 Works with d5300 
30073 Great polarizer, does not attract dust and I have not had problems with it getting stuck. Inexpensive for the quality, although if you have a budget for a more expensive filter like B+W that would be a better route to go. 
30074 I like it. Nice, smooth and eazy to use 
30075 Good price, excellent product!!!!! 
30076 Would not stay registered on my Veralite, even though I had a repeater less than 20 away. I was unable to get Vera it to recognize it again, even when I brought it inside. Maybe defective - I sent it back. 
30077 Works great for mating the pistol grip from the Amazon Basics 70-inch Pistol Grip Tripod to a monopod that s fitted for 1/4-20 thread. 
30078 Five star récord. 
30079 Never got it to work, and I tried on multiple OS s. Very disappointed 
30080 Works as well as OEM at a fraction of the price. 
30081 I can t fault the product, it is as described--- but I seldom us it. Too lazy I guess. 
30082 it works ! 
30083 Fixed the blinking red light of death issue with my FI8920W. I replaced the failed power supply with this one and I was back up and running. 
30084 Fits the camera fine, just don t like how it fits in the camera case. Sticks out so far that you have to leave room for it or take it on and off. 
30085 Absolutely great value! Super snug & comfy with just the right amount of compartments and dividers. Would purchase and would recommend. 
30086 Love using this for my DSLR in the kayak! I holds my camera nicely with extra lenses and some supplies. The shoulder strap is a little awkward, but at least it has it. 
30087 I have had no problem with this battery. Works great in my Canon camera. 
30088 Excellent ball head, especially at that price! 
30089 As expected 
30090 Very nice camera for the price. Good clear image, great features, easy to setup. Very easy to use, both from my smartphone and laptop. My wife loves it for watching our pets when not at home. 
30091 Perfect and much less expensive than the go pro ones. 
30092 Too flexible 
30093 Great camera for the price. I m not a great photographer who can use the SLR s. This camera is about as close as you can get to the quality of a SLR, without buying a SLR. Very pleased with the purchase! 
30094 The right arm broke at the 4th use... and the camera died within a week... Don t buy this :P 
30095 I put 6 rechargeable AAs in it to see how long it would stay on at full power. After 10 hours I finally had to go to bed. I am very impressed with this unit. 
30096 This is my third Sony Cyber shot, I feel like it s NOT made well, but it does take AWESOME pictures. 
30097 Excellent for low light. Great build quality. 
30098 Great camera, great transaction! 
30099 Its pretty good but its not very strong, thats why Im gving it 3 stars 
30100 Works great 
30101 nice 
30102 I slip this into large purses, totes and backpacks so that I can take my digital camera with me without having to bring a separate camera bag. It seems to cushion the camera well. 
30103 Light weight material makes this tripod easy to carry - it comes with its own carrying bag, too. Surprisingly tall (when the legs are fully extended) and sturdy. I mounted my heavy binoculars on this tripod, and the whole thing was very stable. I would definitely recommend this tripod. 
30104 Looks so real 
30105 cheaply made 
30106 Perfect to use with my older GoPro Hero 2 and the inline microphone. 
30107 Excellent product, it works perfectly. 
30108 Good product 
30109 Great 
30110 I love it. it is light and have a lot of adjustment. it perfect for me. thanks 
30111 It works ok. Not spectacular, but ok. 
30112 I LOVE LOVE LOVE this item!! PLEASE restock so I can buy more!! :) 
30113 Beautifully sharp portraits from this lens with gorgeous bokeh. So glad I saved over $1000 by getting this one instead of the 1.4G! 
30114 good results 
30115 This was a sweet camera until the view screen stopped working after a year of light use. I wouldn t buy another one although the color resolution was excellent for art work. Now a monument to wasted money. 
30116 Works as intended..... not easy to operate, but that s how it can be made 
30117 Great backup! 
30118 Excellent product and oportunity, great price... 
30119 great value and excellent product 
30120 This was a purchase for myself and I have found it as advertised and a good purchase. The seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with. 
30121 Perfect!!! 
30122 I upgraded from the FC40. This unit is amazing! 
30123 Fantastic camera for the price. I have gotten several hours of HD video out of it. Love the fact that it automatically corrects for orientation of the camera. 
30124 Great package. Fits my Panasonic LF1 perfectly. 
30125 horrible pictures. piece of junk. 
30126 Perfect for sage keeping and easy transport 
30127 Nice well made hood. I purchased this hood for my GM5 and it fit the kit lens perfectly. 
30128 The sensors are lacking on this product. I am not impressed with the quality and I would have went with a different one if I had it to do again. 
30129 The film I received was either expired or defective. Once I went to use it all of the pictures came out like they were not properly developed. 
30130 lots of product for the price 
30131 great light for video filming the only thing it does not come with the stand 
30132 Fell apart. Crap 
30133 LOVE IT!!!! 
30134 It does a good job with AHD cameras. So far so good. 
30135 Works great. 
30136 it works only a couple of times than just die 
30137 Hope I never have to use it.... but I will.... and I will demand to be served. Thanks. 
30138 Great, and very useful. 
30139 FRIGING best thing I ever got for my GoPro !!!!!! I use it on 75% of protects it allow me to get so many different angles that mounts sometimes restrict you to have. 
30140 Very nice 
30141 I haven t used this enough to know if it will hold up, but so far it s a good tripod for the price. 
30142 Works great. You can mount the brackets on the wall or use c stands for more portability. Great product and the quality seems good. The rollers and chains are plastic, so naturally I was worried but they are sturdy enoug. No complaints. 
30143 Barely got it last night, BUT. First thing I notice is how noisy the shutter is. This surprised me since no one else mentioned this and I thought an electronic, mirror less camera would be silent. Not so! 
30144 Ok 
30145 This little camera works great! VERY cool, and affordable. Here is a little time lapse I did https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRXNr8AMMrI VERY FUN! 
30146 Good product for the price 
30147 Nice and clean shots. I use it with all my lenses now and it is producing get shots for it s cost. 
30148 The Hood did not fit my Canon t5i, as described. I was able to wedge it on most of the way, but even after that, it did not work as well as the other lens hoods I ve used. 
30149 Great product! 
30150 Works a treat 
30151 Needed this for an older JVC. The cleaner did the job. The heads were so bad that I had to run the cleaner through two times, but I can now view and transfer my old Hi-8 tapes to disc. 
30152 It was as described. Have not used it yet. I got it for using under water when in Hawaii. Might go for one that is a bit longer. 
30153 solid 
30154 These cloths are perfect for display screens, glasses, tablets, kindles etc. I use one mostly on my Kindle, it s great for wiping the finger smudges off the screen. 
30155 It is kind of bulky but it provides much more battery time than stock battery that came with videocamera. 
30156 Battery drops dead withins three hours. 
30157 These are excellent cameras, at a great price. Very well made and a definite improvement in resolution and night vision over the cameras that came with my Swann system. I will continue buying them as replacements and add-ons. 
30158 Works great. Good battery life. 
30159 Excellent product. 
30160 Got camera. Working. Fast shipping 
30161 All I Expected! 
30162 Great harness. I took this on a 60-mile hike and wore my camera 6 days straight.. couldn t be happier. 
30163 Was as advertised 
30164 very pleased with the batteries and receiving them so fast 
30165 Excellent camera at an excellent price. I graduated from the SX 40 so had a good idea on how to use it. 
30166 Great product 
30167 Cheap material. Light won t lock in place very flimsy. But the pro is the lights are very bright. 
30168 Excellent product. I have several monocular but Polaris Explorer is another level. Very high build quality, very good optics. Highly recommended. 
30169 This works very well, does all the single shot and burst and timer and bulb shots, exactly as expected. I have not tested the transmitting range distance but am never very far from the camera in my photography. The instruction manual was surprisingly helpful and well done. 
30170 Love this camera, but the history feature take a long time to load. Maybe I need to set it to 780 instead of 1080. 
30171 Worked perfectly as expected. 
30172 It works as advertised, but I do wish the brick was a little smaller. 
30173 Works very well with the Samsung Camcorder. The professional wedding photograph even used it. 
30174 I use this quite a bit with Macro photography, works really well.... 
30175 excellent product 
30176 doesn t work ;( 
30177 It was everything I excepted. 
30178 Very well made. It can even be used as a regular purse if needed. There s plenty of room to fit other stuff besides the instax mini. Beige looks very classy as well. Overall very pleased with my purchase! 
30179 This was purchased for my grandson and he loves it. 
30180 Nice prime Canon EF lens for portrait and low light shooting. It is soft when wide open, but sharpens significantly at about f2.8. I don t use it often, but when I do the results are very satisfactory. 
30181 Average. Works, but not especially well-made. 
30182 Excellent 
30183 No issues 
30184 These worked well with my D3100. 
30185 I love this strap. It feels so good when wearing it because of the velvet that touches the neck. Very good quality and beautiful! Worth the extra money then some others I ve looked at. 
30186 Used it the same day I received it. Have no complaints, as described. 
30187 i love it so much; but the one thing i can t find is the &#34;flash button&#34; to turn it off. 
30188 It served it s purpose for street shots in Europe, but I always wanted to be able to change lenses 
30189 Poor quality. Plastic, not durable 
30190 Great 
30191 Works fine for thé moment. Will really use it only in tow monts. 
30192 It is perfect. This I exactly what I wanted. The camera is a gem. 
30193 Excellent product, fast shipping. Buy without hesitation. 
30194 Awesome camera has alot of extras but moves around when accelerating like on a dirtbike. Just need to figure out how to keep it facing the right way but great picture underwater and regular 
30195 Shipping was fast but missing tripod mount. 
30196 Great product at a great price. Had all the features of the expensive flashes at a fraction of the price. I love this flash! 
30197 good 
30198 Amazing sandals very comfortable 
30199 Was tight at first and nothing said it won t fit with the lens cap on but now its fine. 
30200 Better than previous model with the IR separate, also has audio feed. A challenge of sorts to mount, but doable. Great picture for the price, make sure you get English firmware. check the suppliers.. Some say it is others say from China. Not support available to upgrade if from china 
30201 I love it. 
30202 Just note that the USB cord is for the battery charger not to transfer data from your camera to your laptop (my mistake). However, the battery works great on my Nikon CoolPix AW110. 
30203 Great picture quality day or night. You wont be sorry if you buy this camera. My ZModo system came with 4 and I added 2 more they were that good. 
30204 very good 
30205 This camera is great. I bought mine for a nursery camera. It does get hot when I to turned on so I try to turn it off when I am not using it. But it is super handy and the remote option is awesome. 
30206 cheap! broke on it s first use 
30207 I am returning Kodak Easy Share Printer Dock. We were delighted to find one, but it only prints half a picture. I am enclosing sample. Would like to request refund procedures and information to print return label. Thank you 
30208 Really nice lens bags. Good protection and smooth sides so they slip into my overloaded bag really easily. Will buy more when ii need them. Better than the Nikon bags that come with their lenses. 
30209 No instruction manual, doesn t have very good video at night 
30210 I need more direction 
30211 makes the motor and iris very noisy and slow. but it works i guess 
30212 Love this, if you do not get anything else get this. This really makes you life easier. 
30213 Really like, fits alittle small. 
30214 My son loves this!!! 
30215 Horrible definition 
30216 My son is in love!!! He s a sports fanatic and into all things outdoors. These let him and his friends use their GoPros hands free!! And I don t have to worry about it getting smashed up or left behind!!! 
30217 The carmers is a replacement they work fine and they were what I want. 
30218 Works for Sony action can 
30219 excellent! 
30220 Loved it, I just needed 2 but is good to have them in a drawer next time you need it. 
30221 Yes this is fantastic for our baby monitor. Can put the monitor everywhere now. Very happy. Although it does look very suspect in its packaging which the postman gave me a funny look!!! Lol 
30222 Great for smaller items 
30223 good for the price! here s my sample clip @1080P https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfuSAyqW8_Y music outdoor sample acoustics https://youtu.be/SdLSbkG1EKE https://youtu.be/lSs5epPOFHQ orchestra/band https://youtu.be/Q37u77MbnaA https://youtu.be/1Q-L_ffqd1c very nice zoom downside battery life 
30224 Limited value with sigma 150-500 mm lens since you can t use auto focus and it is hard to manually focus, like shooting craps. Not worth the money. 
30225 I ve had this remote a few years. Recently, the cable stopped transmitting, but Promaster s warranty is wonderful. In a very short time, they shipped a brand new cable to me, and the whole remote works just like new again. 
30226 The plastic finish could be better but the results match the expectation, great flash for any camera. Good battery consumption. 
30227 great what i wanted block out light 
30228 Excellent 
30229 Great little camera. Nice size for a pocket or a purse. Takes great pictures. Nice zoom range. Also, didn’t buy it with the idea of taking any video but the video capability is a good addition and the video quality is better than I would have thought. 
30230 Perfect light with the size , solid build 
30231 Great camera!!! Excellent quality, both pictures and video, a lot of cool lenses in this set. Tripod is very light so you can take it anywhere with you. 
30232 The case was covered by full of mold... But lens covers were ok. Works good too. 
30233 Long and black -- connectors are good 
30234 bad I never worked and the seller did not want to be responable, Amazon had to help me and I returned the money 
30235 Holds a charge well, does its job. Would buy. Again. 
30236 everything came and look like it was in the picture 
30237 LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this camera! GREAT picture, LOVE that you aren t replacing batteries all the time, just needs a charge once in awhile, easy to get pics off, and AGAIN GREAT PICTURE! WORTH EVERY PENNY! 
30238 Quite a few tapes for the money. 
30239 Love just as much the second time purchasing as the first. Awesome product at a crazy awesome price. THANK YOU! 
30240 Exactly as described. Great quality paper! 
30241 bueno 
30242 This is an excellent buy for the money. Very satisfied. 
30243 Everything looks just as promised. Used the products last night and they did a swell job! 
30244 Unit received fits well on my camera and allows a secure hold and feel. 
30245 You really can t beat a good Pelican Case. I mounted these to my 2000 Triumph Tiger 885i and the size is perfect for long rides. For daily riding I m just using my Seahorse tail case. 
30246 Best bang for your buck out there. I use these for star gazing at the milky way when in the bahamas and for other scouting uses during the day. they work very well. 
30247 Thank you. I got it! My friend said he loves it too! 
30248 I love these batteries Work great and they fit my camera 
30249 Now I can carry all with me incase I need a fresh charged one. Great deal 
30250 As expecteted 
30251 Pros: Shipment was timely and met specs as advertised. Cons: Not recommended for a heavy DSLR with large lenses. 
30252 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv0BUK0YocQ Check out the video I did on the unboxing of this item! 
30253 Perfect fit, no loose connections to mess with! 
30254 Awesome 
30255 works as advertised 
30256 Works fantastic even in sunlight at F/1.4. I highly suggest it. I am using it on a 1.5x crop-frame DSLR, so I am not sure if any issues full frame cameras would encounter. However, it s a perfect ND filter to start with. 
30257 Defective product, poor customer service, one of my biggest mistakes 
30258 Fantastic optical quality. 
30259 I could write a technical review here. Many have touted the 7DII and its amazing performance. I will say simply......untouchable for a crop frame camera. If you are thinking of adding this to your collection, DO IT! 
30260 The ball joint works fine, but for the price this company charges for the weather proof housing and this stupid ball joint, it s ridiculous. For $30 you should get the housing and the ball joint. Instead it s $70 for both. 
30261 So far I like them. The rest we will know when he gets back from the deer camp. Anxious to see how videos turn out 
30262 Nice lens for the price. 
30263 charges my camera up right 
30264 Batteries charge up and hold charge well. Great value at a fraction of the cost of Canon batteries. 
30265 I have not as yet had the opportunity to use it, hence the 4 stars. Based on design, appearance, and the ratings of others, I am very confident that it will perform as expected. 
30266 Great quality great quality and intensity 
30267 Nice case, not too small and not too big. Several pockets outside and inside. I have a camera backpack, but I use this case much more often. 
30268 Worked perfectly on our older security monitor set up. Much cheaper then trying to buy a bunch of cat monitors. 
30269 Works like a charm. Lock the mirror up on your camera for steady shots. Great for selfies of my wife and I as we send pictures to our friends. 
30270 I bought this as a replacement for the original canon one that broke. It looks as good as the original however it constantly slides off my T3i. It doesn t lock in place securely and the slightest touch makes it fall right off. 
30271 Love the camera, new to DSLR. Easy to use, on auto settings, yet definitely want to explore more manual settings. Highly recommend. Came as advertised. Delivered on on time with prime. 
30272 Great looking camera but did not check out the functions since I had returned the camera. 
30273 You get what you pay for. The lens is exposed to dust even when not taking pictures. You have to hold this camera very steady or the pictures will be blurred. If this is a 10.1 MP camera, I am disappointed. Bottom line, it is a cheap camera. 
30274 Couldn t get the wrinkles out 
30275 Excellent products and good pricing. Thanks much. 
30276 It s a nice beginner scope but it is very hard to sight in and shakes a lot when trying to adjust. 
30277 Super happy with my drone looks great everything is there how it was advertised thanks guys 👍👍 
30278 very good 
30279 GREAT FOR HIKING,EXTREMELY LIGHTWEIGHT. GREAT VALUE. 
30280 Good Product Works as expected 
30281 OMG! I don t know how Ive done without this! 
30282 So far so good, a lot to learn with this camera to use it to its full potential. 
30283 Sharp views. Takes care of lot aberrations. Excellent high end eye piece for an affordable price. 
30284 These floats work as advertised. Used them in pool and ocean. Used on my Galaxy S4 phone and Kodak waterproof camera. All went well, items floated and the colors were visible. 
30285 Excellent! 
30286 Arrived quickly, and just as expected from the order. Thanx! 
30287 Unfortunately the tapes do not work. Not sure why but ever time I put the tapes in my equipment it would say the tape was dirty. I had to clean my equipment. Unfortunately I missed the window to send tapes back. 
30288 it sucks 
30289 exactly as described, I love this lens 
30290 Great bundle. Only thing is that the tripod seems a little low quality but that s something that we all have preferences for. Other than that amazing. Very pleased :) 
30291 Good camera bag, has a lot of compartments, well padded for protection and durable to use. 
30292 Tripod is a little off center like the guy posted in the video but is easily corrected. I use it with a Logitech C615 Webcam works amazing for this. 
30293 This is the best. I love how compact it is, it fits in my purse, and holds an extra battery. Definitely worth having. 
30294 My experience echoes the experience of others—they re super functional and a good buy. 
30295 Only used to scan 35mm. Magnifies small dust. 
30296 Lens works great 
30297 The order arrived quickly. The batteries and charger have been as good as the battery that came with the camera. Performance as I would expect. 
30298 I m a film student in NYC and i want to take my filming to the next level. The stabilizer was a gift from a dear friend of mine. After expressing my need for a stabilizer, my friend did his research and found the perfect combination of affordable and excellency. 
30299 good pictures, cycle time a bit long. 
30300 For a DSLR such as a Canon Rebel or Panasonic GH4, you need this! Make sure you don t leave it in direct sunlight or you will burn up your LCD like ants in a magnifying glass. 
30301 This is horrible only because mine turned out to be a fake. It wouldn t work and looking at pictures of the same camera, they looked nothing alike. :( 
30302 OUTSTANDING 
30303 Great glasses. Everything we wanted. Thanks 
30304 Great product 
30305 Fantastic backpack for camera and accessories. I don t go anywhere without it. 
30306 first they sent wrong sin card , went and got the new one and it doesn t record!!!!!!!!! The pictures freeze all the time, what a waster of money!!!!! 
30307 Great product 
30308 Nice to have some extra for all my USB sticks and then some 
30309 A complete kit,very usefully Nice and thought camera 
30310 I was sceptic all at first but after playing with the cenera and learning to programimg I am very pleased 
30311 Excellent quality and very fast shipping thank you. 
30312 Great camera for a great price. Still highly recommended 
30313 nice product and an excellent seller 
30314 Zipper broke just after 30 days warranty period expired. Do not recommend this product. 
30315 Film didn t work Did receive refund 
30316 I LOVE, VERY GOOD AND EXCELLENT 
30317 The notes showed this was good for beginner star gazing. It s really hard to set up and not user friendly at all. 
30318 Fits my Tamron 150-600 mm to a T! Quality of materials and fabrication are outstanding. Should last many years of heavy use. This item was supposed to come in September, but it arrived even before the other items I purchased from Amazon on the same order! 
30319 Some work, some don t. When they work they are great for a dark cabinet or a gun safe. Unfortunately some arrive DOA. 
30320 awesome case. helps you keeping it organized and protected 
30321 People had mentioned previously that it doesn t seem to have the same battery life as original camera battiers, but I have not found this to be true. I am very happy with this purchase 
30322 Work great , not problems 
30323 Hard to find Polaroid type film. 
30324 Wonderful camera, color is sharp and clear, the night vision IR is also great. No complaints here great camera at a great price. 
30325 I thought it will be good from the reviews, but no. Its not a quality product, maybe some users liked it but your experience may differ. The part that connect the legs is s***ty and sort of broken? One leg gets off really easily. Sorry, not worth the money. 
30326 This is truly a great value and is very functional. I received this product as promised, in great condition, and it nicely fits my iPhone. I was a bit skeptical about this product because of its low price, but it is truly a great deal and it works nicely. 
30327 This arrived so quickly and is working like a charm. 
30328 Unfortunately this is not adjustable and didn t realize it is big, would not work with someone with smaller wrist. Seller is very professional. 
30329 Good for what it is. Head mount. I don t really use this but its not bad when wearing a hat so you don t feel the elastic sucking the hard plastic pieces onto your forehead! 
30330 Does not improve lens of Fuji HS50EXR, save your money. 
30331 I had no problem installing and they work great. 
30332 No complaints so far! Affordable and far more compact than the manufacturer s charger. 
30333 Just what we wanted. Price was good and arrived as expected. We are very satisfied. 
30334 Would have been far better had it come with some directions. Bought it for my wife. Neither of us are tech gurus. Will figure it out but it would have been far easier with direction. 
30335 The product description mentioned a non-corrosive set of accesories such as the floating handle grip and the hand-held monopod extendable telescope pole, and both have signs of corrosion starting to show in addition to the floating handle grip getting full of water. 
30336 After finally figuring out how the charger works, this is a wonderful thing to have. I think the instructions of use need to be a little more clear to purchasers though. Always glad to have extra batteries for my camera though. 
30337 This is a pretty good little remote. Was able to use it from 16 
30338 There are no bells and whistles - just shutter button and a 2 second delay option. Your camera must be set on self timer - the 10 second mode. Easy, 
30339 Decent product BUT they put the name of the company very large on the side. Masione. Written large on the side. Simple google search tells you they make FAKE cameras. Why not put ANYTHING else? Gonna try and sharpie black it out. 
30340 Great product 
30341 Great for the price! 
30342 Fast shipping. Good performance from products 
30343 Great for underwater photos but extremely mediocre for normal use. Flimsy strap provided broke in a week. Takes blurry photos. Disappointed. 
30344 Great product! Good price and fast delivery!!! 
30345 This stand is HORRIBLE!! Took it out box to set it up and literally pieces began to fly everywhere.The center rod disconnected from the base causing it to be un-level. I could go on for days but overall very inexpensive,bad craftsmanship, It s TRUE You Get What You Pay For 
30346 impossible to make it work. 
30347 OKay, range is a little to be desired. Batteries that came with it were dead, thought it was DOA until i switched it out. 
30348 Very well-built 
30349 Good fit for our Sony A6000 with 30mm prime lens :) 
30350 Works great and easy to use/install! Great online help guide too. 
30351 We are enjoying watching our backyard birds with this great pair of binoculars. Finally had to buy new ones after the one pair we had is over 25 years old. Thank you! 
30352 I am very disappointed to say the following; Item came or received not as advertised in the amazon site. Model came was &#34;Incorrect&#34; and different from the picture shown. No item description or Label see on the device itself and looks like fake and not at all a &#34;genuine&#34; product. 
30353 The pictures are great, I kove this camera. 
30354 Unbelievable. I really appreciate this product. High quality! Amazing photo, video and time-lapse! 
30355 perfect, just what I wanted to protect my camera when out and about. 
30356 Great for my purposes 
30357 Equipment looks great, to bad it s worthless. 
30358 It seems to be doing what I bought it for, protecting the lens from dust and fingerprints and etc. 
30359 runs out quick.... 
30360 For my first backdrop stand it was a great buy. Sturdy and come with a carrying case. Great value! 
30361 These batteries are great for on the go and work very well to keep a long charge! 
30362 Given as a gift. 
30363 Great product 
30364 The camera is great and the service is quick. Walter helped me get I back on the app. 
30365 small bag which does the job for a starter 
30366 This light modifier produces lovely directed light. I wish it came with a carrying case. 
30367 The life of these batteries is about 40% of the battery that came with my GoPro. That s an estimate. My GoPro battery lasts about 3 - 4 hours at 1080p / 60 fps. These batteries last about 1.5 - 2 hours each at the same settings. 
30368 The charger worked and the delivery was very good. Happy with purchase. 
30369 Roy 2nd call did the job .as far as camera ,for the money ,excellent and great picture and wireless ,perfect 
30370 Works great 
30371 Package came waaayyyyyy before expectancy date (like 2 weeks early )it was amazing product is gorgeous and fitsss nicceeee 
30372 Great !! 
30373 I purchased this while on vacation so I could get all of my cameras and lenses back home safe. this is an amazing case. I love it 
30374 Perfect day bag for quick trips. I don t like to carry all of my accessories so this works perfectly. Can fit my DSLR body, two lenses inside easily. Outside pocket is great for extra batteries and memory cards. I use the side pockets for my cell phone and money. 
30375 Works ok. The only thing I would recommend to the designers is away to know that a camera is truly straight. Maybe put some markers to know a camera is leveled. 
30376 Great batteries. They save you money as the C123 s are very expensive. I ended up buying an 18650 for 1 of the lights and it worked amazing but it was to big to fit into the other. These will do. 
30377 Everything was as advertised. You could spend more and only get the charger. Here you extra batteries as well. 
30378 ok 
30379 As advertised. Quicker than expected. 
30380 The opteka micro lens does not even fit. They really try to trick into saying this is made for the AX100 this company needs to get its act together. 
30381 Worked for my 77mm Variable ND Filter which had 77mm threads and 82mm opening on front. Good quality. 
30382 Very good for an everyday use of online selling. Be aware that this is only for small items and if you have bigger items to photo-shoot you need to get something bigger. price is excellent. 
30383 love the borders! perfect for a day at disneyland. 
30384 Awesome 
30385 Thank u 
30386 Great Cam for the price! 
30387 I love these camera s, and with the Hero 3+, every change has been a solid improvement. 
30388 got these for hero 4 silver. no problems at all, and the dual charger is super handy! also charges the GoPro battery with no problem 
30389 I have already used this product numerous times. Including on my boat when my camera battery died! I LOVE IT! 
30390 works great...and still working great 
30391 Everything works pretty well. It get what you paid for. But I did not recieve the spare battery in the package. It is included with the picture but I didnt get on in my order. Other than that its not half bad. 
30392 The sound from this little guy is great. Love the bass that comes from it. 
30393 The fix for the battery is a bit loose but, it does the trick for the price. 
30394 Without screw lock on bottom of case, camera will fall out of case.....when opening to shoot? WHY??. 
30395 functions well and looks good. L E D has discontinued to function after a month or so. Will not operate without a battery. 
30396 The best deal in a TTL flash. Complete kit with off camera remote. Everything except batteries included. TTL Zoom flash pairs perfectly with Nikon 5200. If you need a flash but unwilling to spend $300-400 for Nikon branded one, this is what you want. 
30397 Can t fit extended battery. 
30398 I ordered these especially to make colored sleeves to put over my Windows Phone in my purse (so I could find it!). I ordered Aug. 15 and received the cloths on Aug.17. 
30399 Good Batteries for the prices. 
30400 Fit easily and looks good. 
30401 I just received these items yesterday 8/10/2015 and everything seems to be just fine. 
30402 good 
30403 Great underwater shots! 
30404 Ordered in March, stopped working on June...ineligible for return. 
30405 Cheap and effective. Arrived very promptly 
30406 It s strong and smooth. The only minor drawback is it could use a locking mechanism on the horizontal axis. But the friction knob is very adequate when transporting in the wild. 
30407 Excellent product 
30408 Very Good for Great Price 
30409 These work just as good, if not better than the GoPro version. No complaints and you get more for your money. 
30410 I was nervous it wouldn t fit/work. It worked great for my Fuji Fine Pix F850EXR. Very happy. 
30411 Works like a charm. 
30412 love, have a lot to learn best next to top of line cameras lens is built in and a viewfinder. 
30413 I believe it was a combo of 45 plus developing time and problems with it not feeding the 1st or last pic right which left me 6 pics.....bummed was stoked on the idea. 
30414 Great price with great image 
30415 Very comfortable, and very secure. 
30416 perfect for a beginner 
30417 Work great! 
30418 Just what I wanted. 
30419 Resolution, not that good 
30420 works but very flimsy, do not expect to much out of this thing. 
30421 Clear videos....takes a learning curve to have it up and running, but I got through it. Love the &#34;quick&#34; settings so the camera can move faster. Linked it up to my cell so I can see whats going on from my workplace. Either in the home or away...very nice camera... 
30422 Simple case that offers protection but not a lot of bulk. I like the zipper pocket -- I can keep extra memory cards there or just a little cash. 
30423 Good product. 
30424 Just what I needed. Couldn t find the right battery for my camera. Now I m taking pics without having to purchase a new camera. Thanks. 
30425 Not for outdoors. I hate it 
30426 This was the same number battery, but did not fit my Kodak camera. 
30427 Great fun recording waves and surf. Can not wait for the surf to quiet down a little to get some snorkeling done. 
30428 Works to get better looking video using my DSLR Nikon camera 
30429 Quick shipping, just what I needed and works well. 
30430 asdf 
30431 The particulars of this plan seem to suit my needs if I should need to utilize this protection plan. 
30432 water leak about 25ft 
30433 Very good. 
30434 Great quality from DJI as expected. I have purchased knockoffs at a cheaper price and they have all failed. This is by far the better value. 
30435 works for me great product and real peace of mind keeping my go pro safe. Thanks!! 
30436 Very soft and nice just like the vonoto. This one came in the write color. 
30437 Very good and cheap batteries, I am satisfied ! 
30438 Works great and has a good picture. Pretty easy to set up. 
30439 I love this bag, it is now my primary 
30440 Exact fit for my Canon 70D. Easy to apply. Touch screen function still works perfectly. Highly recommended. 
30441 A gift for my father. He loves them. 
30442 The device didn t work 
30443 Perfect for my needs. Very versatile, quite bright. I have three now. I have some vision issues and this is a lifesaver when I m doing fine work 
30444 Fine purchase 
30445 The GoPro stays on perfectly. No issues with that. But if the pole is extended it rotates. To keep it in place I have to have it retracted and hold the silver part of the pole so that the GoPro stays upright. Not satisfied with this product. 
30446 Excelente. 
30447 excellent 
30448 Excellent and they actually float too 
30449 My daughter loves it. 
30450 So glad I bought this replacement. Works great and charges well. 
30451 Great kit, and great value. 
30452 i really like it,,its a little motion senitive but all in all a good little camera 
30453 Did great. Went on vacation 
30454 Rained a couple of days and did not worry it got wet. 
30455 Working great and the longer length is nice too. 
30456 Can t beat it for the price! :) Fully Manual, but works! 
30457 the quality is noticeably worse with these papers zzz quite disappointed. the ones that come with the printer are way better. now i m going to have 100 crappy pictures ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ never again 
30458 Well done, I Like 
30459 very simple plug and play gimbal. very good value. great if you are to scared to but those metal 3D gimbals for twice the money 
30460 Good product, but buy the 6-pack and get the free case from the PolarPro site - better deal and more complete. 
30461 works well. the alarm will continue to sound until you turn it of. The GE model will stop alarming when the trigger is released. 
30462 Excellent case is much bigger than expected. Holds my extra batteries, suction mount, chest and head mounts, and tons of fixture adjustments. Very well padded, perfectly fits standard locks, and the pressure release valve is very useful when travelling across country with altitude changes frequently. Worth every penny. 
30463 Very good camera , the only flaw is the instruction book only in Japanese. 
30464 I recommend, fast delivery. very good 
30465 Reverted back to my old Pogoplug because this wasn t working right. 
30466 works ok, sometimes it goes off when no one comes in 
30467 Really good cleaning cloths!! Highly recommend for anything with a screen 
30468 Great! 
30469 Super easy to use ! 
30470 awesome flash for videos 
30471 got this as a gift... but hope to get one for myself soon. 
30472 Works well, I took it snorkeling with my underwater camcorder. The extending and retracting method is a bit difficult and needs getting used to. 
30473 Perfect for rooms. 
30474 Does not work. Trim falling off. 
30475 Shipped quickly and is as advertised. 
30476 Works well with my lamp stand. cord would be a little longer. 
30477 Cheaply made in China. Instructions would have been a big help also! Don t buy it! 
30478 Junk. Did not work - at all. 
30479 Item does not work according to the manual. very poorly made. 
30480 The cables were perfect. Just what we needed. They are a nice quality. 
30481 Very good! 
30482 Work just like the battery that came with the camera. So convenient and charge quickly! 
30483 Original cap for my Lumix camera. Fits perfectly. 
30484 very good 
30485 Very well made Product. 
30486 This set is awesome.It is very durable and easy to use, It keeps your go pro in place so you dont have to worry about it getting damaged or falling while in use.I recommend this to everyone to use! 
30487 pretty impressive little gizmo. Everyone in my office wants one. The phone app is also great. All I do is touch the app on my phone and I can see my living room. 
30488 Mobile phone tripod attachment. Works perfectly well. 
30489 It s not professional quality, but for $24.99 you can t really complain. 
30490 Works great! 
30491 It was what I wanted at an affordable price 
30492 perfect 
30493 Fast ship! Very well-designed bag at a reasonable price. 
30494 Nice cameras easy to install excellent picture quality 
30495 Just what we needed 
30496 It worked for me for a year and then my cmaera would not recognize it any more. Next time I will purchase a Canon grip. 
30497 Definition of image is not very good even with adjustments allowed by the program. But what could you expect for the price. Would be nice to add a mirror to be able to see at angle i tight space. Probably could pay twice as much and get a better image. 
30498 One of the Camera s don t work and the hard drive doesn t record. One of the holder for the camera is strip. They haven t responded back to my request for a new camera and hard drive.. 
30499 I couldn t find a better price, and their quick shipping to Hawaii is second to none. Product is as described. The precut slots are perfect for my GoPro and accessories. My only regret is not getting the large sized since I ended up buying more accessories. 
30500 excellent product and fast delivery 
30501 surprised with how solidly its built. provides extra utility as a baton, if needed. 
30502 Works well 
30503 Works great with my Honeywell vista 20p panel. I picked it specifically because CDMA coverage in my area outperforms GSM by far. Telguard interactive is also a great feature. Very happy with the product. Long time Telular customer back to SXT1 
30504 It s ok 
30505 Works great! 
30506 WORKS WELL. 
30507 Good 
30508 nice product i ever used. just go for it 
30509 Love it 
30510 This did not work as expected. 
30511 Works wonderful for all of my lens. I like the hook on them for security and also so I can hook them onto whatever bag or case I am using for easy access! 
30512 Great lens, check out some photos I took with it on my instagram @jonathinadams 
30513 Does the job it was made for. Thank You 
30514 Worked perfectly! 
30515 POJ! Make pics blurry. They make magnifiy 2x but its not worth it when every pics comes out blurry. Returning. 
30516 Camera is good but battery life is low. It drain out fast. Need more power full battery. 
30517 good 
30518 The mechanism seems to be doing fine, but the programming of the system is terrible. Need to make some major improvements. 
30519 This kit comes with everything you would need. The quality is excellent 
30520 Great flash best ever 
30521 Thank you ! 
30522 Great camera, underwater pics turned out awesome! 
30523 Great 
30524 Excellent product! 
30525 Not much to say here, good quality cloths for a pretty good price. Gave me enough to keep one near each of my primary devices, the little phone wipe is neat but overall just kind of gimmicky. I feel like it will lose it s sticky properties in short order. 
30526 This product worked for 1 week, then it wouldn t recharge. My opinion spend a little more money and buy a more expensive one. 
30527 Everything went smooth. 
30528 It s not what I expected you need to remove the whole front cover in order to take pictures 
30529 Poor / little instructions on use i cant figure out how to cycle through all cameras on full screen not switch from 1 to a 3 view. 
30530 Still learning to use, good starter kit in my opinion. 
30531 I like it a lot... My first ring light and so far is good... 
30532 Good product, bit of a fiddle to apply, but then they all are. Customer support from them is excellent. 
30533 Cheap, easy to use, small enough to fit in just about any pocket of my pack. Lasts as long as the GoPro branded stuff. 
30534 I bought it as a portable container for my GoPro and various accessories. It works, but despite the flexible sections inside it really isn t ideal for it. I do like it, and it seems to be holding up well. 
30535 Better than I had hoped for an aftermarket product. Fits perfectly and snugly to boot. Well worth it. 
30536 Great Item! Would buy again. Did not disappoint. 
30537 The acessories not very goos, the camera is amazing, but the quality of the acessories not the same. 
30538 Loved the look and feel. Sadly it fell off after some time never to be seen again. 
30539 Works like a charm! ✔️ stabilization is quick and easy! :) 
30540 Works well as advertised in my Sony A6000. 
30541 Good 
30542 DVR is junk and not usable from web even internally. Received and returned to replace 3 broken cams. Should have sent the whole system back but I had already ran the cables throughout walls. I m now replacing it with blue iris and WiFi cameras 
30543 Awesome juice when you need it. 
30544 It works great thanks 
30545 wish it came with an owners manual like my other one. 
30546 First lens I got for a beginner camera. Works great. 
30547 this thing is better than a gopro picture good but the video is awsome 
30548 Great thanks!! 
30549 Came very quickly and works great! They don t make this camera anymore, and mine got a crack on the battery casing, so I was happy to find a good used one on amazon. VERY SATISFIED! 
30550 Very Good 
30551 Great pictures 
30552 Exactly as advertised. Good camera, accessories were not premium quality, but I knew that going in. This was a great value for me. I m using it to take vacation and family pictures and hobby photos. 
30553 It is good battery 
30554 Came in as expected! 
30555 i need help with this how do i use this i cant find out[[ASIN:B00M7RROU8 8GB Mini HD Glasses Spy Hidden Camera Sunglasses Eyewear DVR Video Recorder Cam]] 
30556 It arrived on time. Everything was as advertized. 
30557 Perfect for my Sony RX1003. Snug fit, looks good. Priced right. 
30558 Fits perfectly and gives piece of mind. Like some other reviewers I had the issue fitting the installed guard in my hardshell backpack, but after a little careful cutting of the pack s foam w/ a sharp knife, the guard slides right in, secured w/ the zip ties. 
30559 My Swann video security system came with four cameras with the DVR able to support eight. I purchased two more cameras and needed the additional power supply. This unit powered up the new cameras just fine and has been working fine for several months so far... 
30560 Excellent for holding multiple flash units 
30561 This lens hood fits perfectly on my 75mm f1.8 lens. I have not seen the Olympus equivalent, but this lens hood is well built and works as expected. 
30562 Dead right out of the box. My dogs were roaming the neighborhood until I could find a decent replacement. 
30563 as described 
30564 Nice backdrop. 
30565 Great 
30566 This strap makes carrying a camera very simple without pulling on the neck or being uncomfortable. I would recommend to anyone. 
30567 Good build quality, but did not fit my Canon EF 24-70mm 4.0 lens, despite the listed technical specifications indicating it would. 
30568 guuud 
30569 Good quality 
30570 I wish that I had this from the start. Now I have my 18-55 and 55-300 that are useless to me. This does it all and yes it is very well constructed. Nice Job. 
30571 Great Product, it is a better back pack than the actual DJI back pack. 
30572 Did not work! 
30573 Does not connect to wifi no matter how hard you try, had to return product 
30574 This item arrived promptly. Unfortunately the white reflector was marked with purple throughout. Whereas, I have done a lot of positive business with Fotodiox in the past, I am willing to upgrade my opinion of this product once it has been replaced. 
30575 Every bit as cute as shown. 
30576 Extremely helpful!
