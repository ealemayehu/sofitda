1 Excellent battery. Holds charge as good if not better than the factory battery that came with the LUMIX. Will be buying more. Also the charger works great too! 
2 So many accessories come with this camera for any situation! Also my GoPro accessories work with this camera as well! 
3 This item worked as expected, and was great for the simple task of keeping an eye on my drive way. 
4 It did what it was supposed to do. Satisfactory Product 
5 Great camera 
6 While this will do the job, the plastic construction is very flimsy and more expensive that others that appear to be made out of better materials. Look for something else. 
7 Bag is very nice quality. Beware of how small it is though, I end up have to return this! 
8 Why purchase a great Sony lens and get a knock-off lens cap? Picked up this as an extra. 
9 Use these to upgrade cables I got with cameras. These cables work great. I installed 13 Lorex cameras including a PTZ camera and have not had any issues. There is no signal issues particularly for cameras more than 100 feet away from DVR. 
10 These are fakes! I could barely control my Phantom with these on and nearly crashed into nearby objects. DO NOT BUY THESE! 
11 good 
12 I bought this thinking my camera needed a new battery, but it turns out it has some other issues. The battery itself was great along with the shipping which came early than anticipated which was fantastic! 
13 GREAT LENS FOR THE MONEY 
14 my new baby love it!!!! 
15 Attached it to my waterproof Nikon coolpix camera and it works great- the camera floats. Also, the floatie is not overly big and bulky. 
16 Has short depth of field. 
17 No support. Doesn t do ftp doesn t work properly with motion detection, doesn t seem to do anything well. 
18 Good buy 
19 So far it works well. My only complaint is that the cord is shorter than the original. 
20 Easy to adjust and fits comfortably on anyone s head. Perfect mount for any activity to get great action shots with the GoPro! 
21 Hands down, the best mount Ive came across! I originally bought the $5 knock off one, and it broke the second day I had it! 
22 It was a gift. She liked it 
23 A bit bulky, but it held my brother s camera above water when dropped it in the ocean on accident! 
24 This thing is a pile of junk, cannot even figure out how to make it take pictures! Once you turn it on you cant turn it back off you have to wait for it to die. 
25 Love these wipes! Third time I ve bought these. 
26 With no OSD there is no way to change the camera settings and the picture is so bright it is almost washed out. I m replacing this one with something that will work for FPV. 
27 Everything I have ever bought from Cowboy Studio has been good stuff. 
28 Nice bag overall. One of the side buttons was broken. 
29 I can t seem to get this strap to the point where I know it won t drop my camera. 
30 Fits my Nikon D3100. neck strap very comfortable. Can t beat the price. Would recommend to anyone wanting a more comfortable strap than the one provided by Nikon. 
31 display went broken, purchase was quickly reimbursed, so I bought Nikon 610P 
32 Works as promised, lost my other one, and this one fits perfectly! 
33 Excellent product. It adds flair to my black/white/pink camera strap. 
34 Great backdrop. Does have folds but I believe those will go away over time. Great product for the price! 
35 Good. 
36 These batteries are not good at all. They hold a charge a fraction of the time of the regular battery. 
37 Everything came as described! Great deal! Fast shipping! Would buy from again! Thank you. 
38 I needed a new camera and bought this going on very little info. I LOVE IT!! It has been the best little camera for everyday pics and video. I m always pleased with my prints. 
39 Love it! Everything I need fits in neat and comfortably. 
40 Excellent product. With all three tubes connected was not able to have auto function but that s not a problem. Will never use them all together anyway. Would recommend. 
41 Great camera, got it few months back and enjoying it. Superb quality and fast shipping from beach camera... 
42 Very disappointed, needed my software tools to get the going. Did not stated in description. 
43 Arrived earlier than expected and as described. Very good price for all included items. 
44 Works great with smartthings... Wish it was a little smaller. 
45 rec d as promised and as advertised 
46 when i purchased this, i do not remember it saying things were not included, i can almost remember it saying it was a complete kit. NEver been out of the box, since hubby knoew it wasn t complete kit. 
47 Got this camera at a great discounted price and am very happy with it excellent night vision, very easy to set up for use with ipad. 
48 AAA+++ 
49 Very good camera. Works great!! 
50 a great little case to carry your Coolpix Camera around with you in the car or anywhere s. it protects it from damage that could happen if you just carried it everywhere without this case. Has a strap to carry it by too. 
51 love it 
52 Real easy mount to handlbars 
53 Perfect, exactly as described. 
54 They work great. I did not.use the cables that came with it 
55 I use regular mono audio cable. 
56 Just enough there so I don t drop the camera. 
57 Looks and feels like a great product arrived on time and was exactly how it was described haven t used it a whole lot but seems to work good 
58 Wow great filter very smooth rotation and really nice fit and finish super thin should work well on my Tokina 11-16. 
59 Love the color resolution of Ektar; again I am a free-lace professional photographer---went to the Nikon School of Photography---love experimenting with various formats 
60 I like the camera. It came with a nice package. 
61 It is what it s stated. The horn works great. 
62 lovee my lamp 
63 Works well enough, but it s a huge rip-off that this item doesn t include the velcro strap that holds it to your speedlite. It includes sticky velcro bits, but these would be stuck to your speedlite permanently and wouldn t allow for other, similar attachments (like a diffuser box). 
64 Battery charger works fine; cheaper than Fuji product. 
65 I couldn t be happier. 
66 Great item 
67 Kenneth was very helpful dealing with the problem that I was having with my 2 camera s. They are both up and running. The port forwarding is up and running also. Thanks again for the support. 
68 it s okay 
69 Exactly as expected. 
70 It is so nice to have a machine to take our old slides and negatives and make them digital! Nice quality. 
71 Very nice little camera 
72 It s ok. 
73 All the velcro comes off and my camera and gear gets jumbled. Great durability though! But terrible &#34;compartments.&#34; 
74 This is a great portable tripod. It s sturdy, and easy to use. 
75 I use this for my gopro.I loop it through the case hole which works reallywell the onlydonside is you cant attach it to anything else but then again if you are using a wrist strap you should be holding the camera anyway 
76 Pen Camera & Keychain Camera works perfectly and delivered on-time, Thank You 
77 It s ok 
78 They are a little different from my original battery but them make good back up batteries. 
79 Needed this for a larger lens I d purchased...great! 
80 Does what its designed for. Seller was great with customer service. One of the batteries died after 3 weeks. Big Mike sent me a new one free of charge. I did have to send the defective one back as proof but that s cool with me. Mike 
81 fit my light exactly 
82 perfect for the job. 
83 This fit my GoPro 3 waterproof case perfectly! It allowed me to securely attach a floating lanyard wriststrap on my GoPro for when I shoot hand-held at the beach or out in the surf at the ocean. 
84 Great product for the price 
85 Work great. Nice and bright. 
86 Works great, it brought life back to my older GoPro Hero 2 and the batteries last much longer than the original. 
87 Seems sturdy enough to handle what my son throws at it. Been on bike rides and under water and not treated lightly, yet holding up well. 
88 May not be real leather, but fits like a glove and classy looking. 
89 The product did not fit the camera body properly and was a waste of money. 
90 Amazing deal, and this works so much better than even the battery that came with my camera. 
91 so coool i got to get more usin this one to control the LEDs on my tool box 
92 This one is much better for someone with smaller wrist because this is some what adjustable. 
93 These batteries are better than the one that came with it. Very happy with this purchase. 
94 work as we were expected. 
95 Camera spins all around. Terrible extension pole. just by the &#34;GoPro&#34; made products. They are more expensive but the quality speaks for itself. 
96 Package came on time and works fine. 
97 Great replacement battery 
98 This is my 3 camera like this. Love it and have given to friends. While I have newer cameras, this is an excellent goto and carry camera. Easy to use and excellent results. Has everything and more on it. 
99 Product was missing POE injector. I ordered 5 none of them came with a free POE injector as mentioned in listing. 
100 Use it on my cell phone and Sony Action Cam. Kinda short but does the job, also build really sturdy. 
101 Awesome technology with a seamlessly integrated experience. Nest cam linked to Nest thermostat and tied to a mobile phone with IFTTT is the answer to all your home automation desires. 
102 Just perfect, works great. Get one and throw it in your camera bag. 
103 Everything was just as expected. Thanks. 
104 Great for the price 
105 Everything can be used on my hero 4 
106 Nice snug fit, yet easily removed. Perfect positioning on xe1. Nice finish. 
107 I lover it , nice camera , I recommend for any travel 
108 Easy to use ! Just a button 
109 All of my friend and family love it, Have a fun time with this instant camera Must have item in the party 
110 Small camera with great picture quality 
111 Works great 
112 made with high quality. No issues. 
113 Arrived quickly and works well. 
114 excelent 
115 I love the camera, works great in low light. I would not purchase from this seller again. 
116 Worked great holding my go pro 
117 A wonderful case. Well constructed and stylish. I m not sure it represents a value at over $100.00 though... 
118 works great as expected 
119 like camera a lot 
120 cameras are working great 
121 Good quality, covers all the basics. Very happy with the items 
122 Does what I wanted it for. Very pleased with purchase&#62;&#34; 
123 Works well. Doesn t last as long as the Nikon batteries, but far cheaper. 
124 Excellent shoe- very comfortable 
125 works well as expected 
126 Easy to use; load, unload, operate and keep dry. 
127 Works just as good as my D cell military issue 
128 This stabilizer is a piece of junk. Save yourself the trouble and just buy a glide cam. 
129 Awsome product you can t beat it 
130 its a fantastic addition to my camera. 
131 dosen t stick to the surface of my Jeep dash. 
132 Much larger than I thought it would be, can be awkward to have hanging on your neck strap, but it does hold the lens cap so I won t lose it. 
133 Great screen protector for the 5Ds even thought it can shift side to side just a little bit. Id recommend it to anyone. 
134 I ve used that can literally hold my Nikon D610 with its 28-300mm lens--now that s heavy. This thing is rock sold, light weight and easy to use. Get one. 
135 Excellent! Thank you!! 
136 When your hand can t seam to get it tight enough or your hands are greasy and slimy, this tool is a lifesaver to ensure that you GoPro Camera is tight! 
137 Works as advertized 
138 Excellent 
139 Wonderful pics. A perfect substitute for my Nikon coolpix... 
140 I m happy with it. Learning a lot. 
141 the kit was awesome, the camera bag, doubled as a hangbag in the evening. perfect size. all product was true to reivews and everything worked great. The condition of the ship was well packaged, I would recommend this highly 
142 Love this camera. Great to emsil photos directly from the camera. 
143 Nice camera! 
144 This camera conveniently stopped working just after the return period passed. Cheap, flimsy, and apparently breaks easily. Stay away from it! 
145 So far, so good compared to my carbon fiber props 
146 I use this all the time now. love it. 
147 I guess it is true that you get what you pay for. the frame is flimsy and I was not able to figure out how to use it. Am returning it. 
148 It s a nice strap, well made, strong, and comfortable, and it looks good too. I like the length of the strap but just me personally. I m sure an adjustable version of this strap will fit more people s needs. 
149 Works OK 
150 i love it...as expected 
151 Great quality... 
152 This didn t work! 
153 Allowed me to go from 52mm to 77 on Canon Lenses. 
154 The first time I used, one of the lights stop working 
155 fit perfect and works great for a Bullard T3 
156 Works flawlessly with Minolta MC lenses on Lumix GX1, as described. Thanks! 
157 It is impossible to use the camera without completely removing the upper part of the case. It s just to tight for flexible use. 
158 Best two dollars I have ever spent. It is very strong and fit on my tripod perfectly. It might not fit your tripod though, all are not the same! I would check the specs if they are available. Happy shopping! 
159 Great kit and seller 
160 Water got inside and I haven t been able to get it out. Other than that it s as advertised, floats well, would recommend. 
161 Seems to be very good so far. Great on eyeglasses and electronics. I like the large size, easy to use. Very pleased. 
162 Great battery 
163 Very good service. No issues with the battery. Very good alternative. 
164 The first set did not thread properly, i was sent another set with an adapter, once using that I can no longer use my lens cap. 
165 It doesn’t hold a charge as well as the Panasonic battery. 
166 bought these to hook thumb drives to for my clients.... what can I say... they are inexpensive... and they do exactly what they are made to do... good job 
167 Great product quality. The MagicFiber is very strong, yet soft. Product was exact as described and arrived early than we expected, as well great packing. Yes, will buy again. 
168 Works better than expected and easy installation. Motion detection with record works great. Catches my cat passing by. Speaking and listening features work well. 
169 Great 
170 Very high quality caps at a great price. What else do you want? 
171 This is really nice for small spaces inside for bouncing the light (instead of using a card to bounce off of). I ve since purchased a separate flash, but will keep this as a backup! 
172 Great filters to have on hand for some fun special effect shots to make your pictures pop out. Be creative and make special moments even better. 
173 Great seller! Great product! 
174 Good morning. How long does delivery in the box of this product. Thank you. [[ASIN:B00YX6KSS6 PowerLead PLD003 DV C8 16MP High Definition Digital Video Camcorder Dv DVR 2.7 TFT LCD 16x Zoom Hd Video Recorder Camera 1280 x 720p Digital Video Camcorder Camera Black]] 
175 Came really fast. Had no defects Im in love with this product:) 
176 Touch screen sensitivity not as good as a smart phone. Worsens when screen protector film is applied. 
177 top of the line. 
178 GREAT DEAL OVER ALL FOR THE PRICE. WOULD HAVE LIKE IT MORE IF THE PACKAGE CAME WITH MORE DETAIL ON LENS USEAGE 
179 Fair 
180 Have used the mask twice now and like it. 
181 Very happy with this purchase. Amazing quality and so easy to use 
182 Sometimes the camera will just fall off. So now we double check the tightness of the connection often. 
183 Nice clarity and adheres easily without any bubbles. No squeegee required. 
184 I was impressed with the quality. I usually buy Cowboy Studio products for short jobs or one time uses, but this backdrop setup is actually pretty decent. 
185 Exactly what I expected! 
186 Great lens! I like this package because it includes some freebies. The add ons are not great but they are free so no complaints. This is my go to lens. 
187 Very good quality, it fits perfect, very light but strong. 
188 great quality pic...easy to configure. 
189 This is my 4th Canon SX camera. I m pleased with the performance and also the battery life. I use cameras for work, I m outdoors, on roofs, in crawl spaces and in attics with or without any light source and the picture quality is very good. 
190 This monopod is perfect when you need to steady your camera for a shot, but you don t have the time to set up a tripod. The small size of the monopod makes it easy to tuck away until you need it. 
191 Worked perfectly in my camera. I needed additional batteries since I would be using the camera in the Grand Canyon for 10 days without a way to recharge the battery. Worked like a charm! 
192 Very useful 
193 Great replacement as it is also the original from Nikon come with the original box also. 
194 Don t hesitate to call customer service for help setting this up if you are having trouble. I fried one and called customer service and learned all kinds of goodies not mention in the instructions. 
195 ok 
196 Great quality, thank you 
197 Exactly what I was looking for 
198 awesome fluid head! bought it along with a K2 Slider, very sturdy and solid build! Super smooth pan and Tilt! 
199 a little flimsy, but works for my purposes 
200 love it 
201 Great product, was as described. Worked perfectly. 
202 box was partially crushed. cheap remote with NVR was cracked.no manual came with NVR and it appeared like it had been used before. 
203 Been a photojournalist way back highschool for the school paper but never really pursued photography after. I never thought i would spend this much but oh boy, i was so surprised when i got the package today, there was so much in it! great package deal! 
204 for some reason don t work 
205 Amazing case for my drone, all the accessories fit in the right place. Would recommend it to everybody who has a Dji Phantom 3 drone. 
206 Great product at a great price! 
207 It s nice and durable, snaps onto a belt buckle if you re hiking. Good buy, good deal. 
208 Good 
209 could be made more user friendly 
210 Works 
211 Great quality 
212 Martin Powell at Foscam was very helpful in setting up my camera. Tech support is great. 
213 love it works good for my needs and nice design. Thanks!! 
214 Really good product. Delivery on time, and is exactly they describe. 
215 Work great with my &#34;Chesty Mount&#34;. No complaints. Fast shipping. Good Price. 
216 Suprisingly simple yet effective protection. It is large enough for my Nikon D810 with the 24-120mm lens and lens hood (a sizable hood, reversed on the lens body) to fit snugly. 
217 The software will not download. I need to return it 
218 Fits and works perfectly. Really enjoy the stereo sound now when recording video 
219 Excelent! 
220 Love the way my photo equipment goes in to the bag, well made material, happy with the product 
221 Hello ....I highly recommend this product ...it is very nice aNd easy to operate and co portable for handy....everywhere I go I ll bring this with me and I hope I can get one of this to give it to my sister in ph..... 
222 No problems. Batteries are now charged and ready to use 
223 excellent ever 
224 So far i like it but am still learning all the different things it can do. the instruction guide is sadly lacking so I am using the hit and miss method. It does take excellent pictures 
225 Good transaction and a good product. 
226 awesome 
227 The film had a bubble in the center of the pack which shows up on the picture. Plus the film has a blue faded border 
228 It is not good quality,now it is not working!flash light on and any keys no function !i put it into my trash can ,it is unbelievable such kind of thing happened on Amazon! 
229 I CAN TAKE BETTER PICTURES WITH MY ORIGINAL SONY LENS THAN USING THIS PIECE OF GLASS. 
230 I LOVE this lens. I initially bought it to do indoor shoots but end up using it outdoor because it creates such beautiful photos! 
231 Excelente! 
232 Works filne 
233 I love my new camera! I shopped for a long time, read a lot of reviews, and this is the one I chose! It is easy to use and takes great pictures! 
234 Good and attractive. Clear pictures 
235 Perfect cheap and resistan 
236 Awesome sauce! Works great easy to use I go away a lot it saves the day every day compact good for almost everything 
237 Love it! 
238 it is worth it and I like lot of the tripod will use lots for outdoor like wildlife or landscapes thank for Amazon and the price awesome. 
239 Great Product! 
240 Really easy to use, light weight, and it helps you adjust the exposure which is great. Only downside is you use film up quickly so it s a good idea to stock up good thing the film is relatively cheap. Overall happy with my purchase 
241 Love it! 
242 No cameras!! So, I returned/replaced and what do you know? No cameras AGAIN!! Wth 
243 Pan head release lever broke within 6 months with minimal use. Unfortunately, past the refund date and I can t find a replacement part. 
244 Had a spec on the sensor easily removed by this blower. 
245 works good 
246 My pride and joy! 
247 Easy easy easy to use and fly 
248 Great starter dslr camera and extras. The tripod is nice. The filters are rubbish but everything else is great. 
249 A great accessory kit 
250 I actually buy these tanks just for the reels. The reels with the bigger loading ears are so easy to use. I have three of these and use them weekly. Highly recommend for 35mm or medium format processing. 
251 Vincent, was super in both helping me set up my cameras very professional, Cameras are great I have 5 foscam cameras with no problems!! great products!! 
252 Great for an extra wide angel lenses like my Canon 10-22mm. For extra wide lenses, you need a slim profile for such wide angles and good quality glass. 
253 This is an excellent set and delivers excellent quality photos and video. I also have a Sony A-58, and while I m not sure that this camera does a better job, can say that both are very good for the money. 
254 The case fits Phantom 3 perfectly. It s a must have to protect your investment. Also bought one for my brother and he loves it 
255 nice item need spares........ 
256 I thought it d be much better the straps were all too loose and you were unable to tighten it 
257 Looks real from a short distance. Exactly what I was looking for. 
258 Very Nice! These are great for low light conditions. They re a bit heavy for extended use without a tripod but the payoff is the light gathering power. 
259 THANKS 
260 Great product 
261 Worked as stated. 
262 This battery does hold its own. It is second to none in its class. 
263 I am pleased with the product thus far - the field of view seems pretty good. Vincent was great with helping me set this up on my wifi network. 
264 My grandson LOVED this camera and uses it regularly ! 
265 it s fine 
266 works well 
267 It s slow 
268 Awesome product works will for the price 
269 Did not fit my camera 
270 Cameras were too low rez. 
271 my favorite pouch 
272 Just what I needed! 
273 LOVE THIS!!! I use it for everthing from recording instructional videos to pool side shenanigans and boating fun! 
274 darn someone stole it....no wonder...a great camera 
275 This product is not for high shutter speed. its working fine only till 250/second S.speed. But SLRs usually have S.speed range of 4000 - 6000 per second. Thus this flash dismissed 
276 Takes great photos BUT never drop it. The camera fell from my pants pocket and never worked correctly again. Customer service from Nikon was very disappointing. I would never order another Nikon product ever. 
277 Camera picture is great, but significantly limited by constant dropping of wireless connections despite strong signal. Worse it then fails to reconnect without rebooting. Maybe a firmware upgrade will improve the situation, but hard to recommend as an outdoor wireless solution. 
278 I m just starting out with my DSLR caverage so I do not have tons of equipment but for what I do havery this has been perfect. Also travels well and has enough space for odds and ends without having to bring anew extra.bag for personals. Great purchase 
279 I just received today this item and is big, more than I was expected, is good for a camera, even a camcorder and most of the equipment, so if you are serious on photography this is it. 
280 great quality 
281 Very good, easy to use and charge. Presentable and keep charge very well. 
282 good experience dealing with this item. 
283 Got this for my gf. She loves it! 
284 Suitable for EOS M with 22 mm lens. Beware, it would not fit if you have a lens hood. 
285 They work well. You get a lot of them, the size is good, and they aren t that expensive. 
286 Works great! Took it out into he back country, had several other people take turns carying it on a long Mtn climb. They all commented on how comfortable it was! 
287 works just fine--and at a lower cost than Canon s. 
288 Tripod is crap, others fine 
289 Best video stabilizer I ve ever used. Great use anywhere and the price is very affordable. Thank God for this video stabilizer. 
290 Seems to charge drained battery fairly rapidly. Car charger a nice touch. 
291 Product arrived as promised. 
292 it is good 
293 works well for my needs 
294 So far everything works fine. 
295 Yes. Wish every camera had this. Works great, lightweight, protects the lens. 
296 Iphone 6 plus with a case is hard to fit and stay. 
297 first of all this tripod is 45&#34; tall not 50&#34; as advertised. It is also incredibly flimsy. 
298 Perfect compliment for my Sony mark II camera. This camera case protects very well my investment. 
299 What I needed. Thanks! 
300 PERFECT. 
301 They work really well 
302 fit GoPro wonderfuly and fit nicely into the flash hot shoe 
303 Took some time getting used to knowing when it was on or not but it worked great when I did. Used it for a youtube reality show where people compete in small challenges and it worked like a charm! 
304 Great than I think.. Just imagine 83x zoom... It s soooooooo amazing.. Attached image is full moon with 83x zoom.. Not cropped image.. Unbeliable~~!!!! 
305 Very nice tripod. I like the sturdy feel of it. 
306 Great deal on a terrific flash. 
307 Seems to have everything was looking for. Very pleased with the whole process. Certainly faster than ordering from the manufacturer. 
308 The power pack and charger is versatile enough to allow charging in many different situations. It definitely met all of my needs. 
309 The screen viewing angle was very poor. Also, the motion censor switched off the photo frame even when we were seated near by and we had no way of setting the time delay for the frame to switch off. Overall a poor design. 
310 This was really hard to figure out on which buttons to push. The instructions said the light would be one color and it was different on the pen. Not very good. 
311 I love this.excellent flash 
312 As good or better than the original GoPro Chest Strap. I am extremely satisfied with this product. My GoPro one wore out after a year of constant usage. This one feels like it will last longer. Well manufactured!! 
313 Didn t work!! Don t buy 
314 excellent product 
315 I can t believe this was rated as highly as it is. Everything about this is so cheap. The velcro and the panels all show up like eye sores in photographs. Even if I could iron out the creases it still wouldn t be useable. Really disappointed. 
316 The camera nice zoom great but cant get it to hook to wifi call and email kodak with no response i have other kodaks love them very dissapointed in the company lack of customer services 
317 Very smart design, makes life so much easier 
318 This is loud, but not incredibly loud. If you are in the same room it is loud. But we have ours downstairs and i am not sure it would wake us up if we were sleeping. The long cord on the ac adaptor is a nice feature 
319 Fits the bill 
320 [[VIDEOID:8a690c986214b35c86e6be7f1d1af04f]]I just bought one of these cameras and it is everything it says it is! I am completely blown away by the quality for the price! I highly recommend this little guy! I added a video from work that I took using this camera! 
321 The TX heat melted away my dashcam but it still works! Wow! 
322 Works good, already had a accident in mi dirt bike and resist the impact, but keeps working good !!! 
323 Still playing with it. some time is works and other times it does not. Once I know more I will make a more informed comment. 
324 Works very well. Only reason for the 4 stars, is that the dimensions are not perfect on it. One side is shorter in width then the other. Luckily the material stretches so I was able to make up the difference. 
325 Just like everyone says, it is so adorable 
326 Good product..... 
327 For some reason, this lens capp was very awkward to take off. I am hoping it will loosen and become easier to on-off the lens. 
328 The background is see through really doesn t work well with photography we shooting with our something dark in back of it 
329 As described and shipped fast! Thanks 
330 Saved my GoPro .... 
331 This is a horrible product! Do not buy! The image is distorted around the edges with no sharpness at all! I will be asking for a refund! Yes you get a wider angle but what good is it when you loose all sharpness around the edges! 
332 No problems with set up, self programed, easy. 
333 Hard to focus for pictures 
334 Terrible 
335 According to bhphotovideo.com, these cameras are only 0.3 MP CMOS. To me that means LOW resolution. No wonder the listed specs are so vague. It s a good buy if you are willing to settle for such low res imaging. 
336 great quality for the price. I gave it four stars because there is quite a bit of electronic feedback in the audio. 
337 Everything you need for a clean camera. I feel like there s way too many microfiber cloths but I guess too many is better than not enough. 
338 This product was bought as a gift. Their overall rating was a four out five. 
339 The case is a little small. I bought it for a Nikon S3000, which is a very small camera, but the case is a verrry tight fit. 
340 All items included as described. Seems to be a good starter pack. 
341 Works great. 
342 Amazing, it s so compact. Throws farther than expected. 
343 The strap is a little stiff, but much more comfortable than the stock camera straps that come with most DSLRs. The suede underside feels so nice against the skin that I hardly notice it on my neck. I ve received many compliments on the cute pattern as well. 
344 This was excellent, I was able to watch tapes that I thought I would never be able to see again. I was able to share these memories with my grandchildren. 
345 This head strap works well, the price is reasonable. 
346 Great package, exactly as stated on the website. Lens is fantastic ... a little stiff in movement but otherwise amazing 
347 Works as advertised. Simple and well made ! 
348 I like the go pro, it works great and no problems 
349 Everything was great for a month then 3 cameras went gray. I was also unable to view on my phone or computer. 
350 Awesome seller! Fast shipping and delivered as expected. Thank you 
351 The product works great!! Walter the support person is very professional and excellent support person !!! 
352 Excell 
353 Really good quality for the price your paying and just enough for the newbie photographer. with this set you can experiment a lot and then jump to a professional 
354 Great product - but I ordered the wrong one - so I gave it as a gift to a friend that could use it on their camera. Good price and product. 
355 Love this set of products, I will be purchasing from this company again. 
356 The camera is nice, but the battery really doesn t hold a charge for more than a day or so. 
357 Sound quality of the voice of the person wearing the pen sucks. Is not compatible with Windows 8. Besides that the return was seamless. 
358 Easy to set up and use via phone apps. Cannot zoom in browser app. 2-way audio and night vision work well. HD feed is nice. 
359 Great camera for the price. Now I can watch what my dog is doing when I m not home. 
360 Love the lids, but the accompanying literature is a little thin in substance. 
361 My sister loved this and I m really glad it s compatible with the Polaroid version too 
362 These are genuine DJI propellers and they work well. The only thing that differentiates these propellers from the ones included with the Phantom 3 is the stripes on the tips of the propellers. These propellers are ONLY for the Phantom 3 
363 Doesn t let adding network cameras, unless they are directly connected to NVR. Doesn t let you conveniently display just two feeds where the display is positioned vertically (1x2 grid). 
364 Came quickly. Was exactly as expected. Thank you. 
365 Like it 
366 It s a very good kit for your camera it has some of the filter essentials 
367 Excellent charger for the camera battery. I have passed the camera on to my granddaughter who is still using this charger. 
368 Cute border and great quality photos 
369 Works great! 
370 Hi, I bought this product and I did not get all parties. in the picture I show the items they got me and the product comes with more items. would like to know what happened to the other items that bring the product? Thank you. 
371 Nice 
372 Love it. I am so happy with how smooth and fast everything started and ended 
373 love this camera , had this same one yrs ago 
374 Exactly as described, works fine, no issues. 
375 Great bundle. I purchased early to use as a stocking stuffer for my teenager. The colors are beautiful and it arrived looking just as advertised. It came quick and neatly packed. 
376 The unit showed up in perfect condition. It was very easy to set up and we are enjoying the use of our new security camera system. This was a pleasant online shopping experience. 
377 Buy good one once rather than buying cheap again and again 
378 Very happy with my purchase and delivery was on time as well. 
379 Manfrotto rocks! Great and aesthetic tripod! 
380 She loved it! 
381 I have used these for a while with no problems. Its always good to carry spare batteries for your GoPros. I would recommend these products. 
382 Perfect! Great product, great price, great delivery! 
383 bad quality of video 
384 Great product! The quality of the plug and set screws was very good. I found them easy to use in both retrofitting an existing cable as well as a new one. Will definitely reorder them from IMBAPricewhen the time comes. 
385 This was a gift. She loves it! Excellent quality! 
386 Perfect. Fit like the originals. 
387 ok 
388 Fits great and helps with the glare without blocking the view. 
389 Yongnuo!! you are the best!!!! 
390 Works well for what I bought it other that the cord it s really short! 
391 Purchased for my daughter and it works just fine. If you are a power camera user, you might want to invest in a higher quality unit. For the casual user the quality is fine and should last a long time 
392 Just installed. Good product 
393 Good product. Fits in the frame differently than the real GoPro &#34;Frame&#34;. Still works as designed with access to the buttons. 
394 fits my d5200 perfectly 
395 Excelent 
396 Dead on arrival. Light comes on power converter but the camera will not power on. 
397 Buenisimo 
398 Initial shipments got lost... otherwise the replacement or second shipment arrived as Espected. Thank you.. 
399 Decent lenses to start off with, definetely had a lot of dust. The zoom ring is rather sticky. The focus ring is amazing. 
400 Seemed like a great deal for the money, but they didn t even last a full year. Both batteries have swollen slightly (as many cheap batteries seem to do) and don t fit inside my Fuji X-T1 any more. Pretty bummed. 
401 Great and sturdy tripod, glad I ordered it, highly recommend. 
402 This was such a bargain. Paid $57 on a lightning deal and the app that goes with it is fantastic as others have described. 
403 Better than Nest Cam...1/2 the price...no google.... 
404 This camera is great for the price. It is difficult to set up, but the customer service is very helpful! 
405 My daughter s graduation pictures came out beautifully and it arrived on time, you saved the day and beautiful memories for me and my family thank you. 
406 Not the best glass in the world but the closeup lenses do their job adequately. To the naked eye, the lenses do mot appear to be coated although Hoya claims otherwise. I recommend this product. 
407 Great quality. I was shocked at ho easy it was to setup. The app works great to login and view from anywhere! I will buy another one...or two! 
408 It works. 
409 a little heavier than I thought, but high quality and really save my shoulder. 
410 110% GOOD all the way 
411 Cheap. Plastic 
412 It love the strap. It takes a lot of pressure off my neck, especially with the heavier lenses. I like that the connection piece is metal, so I feel that it will remain sturdy for many years. 
413 Good camera. Just wish it would zoom out to a wider field of vision. 
414 works , good for the money 
415 This product is light weight and durable. Easy to setup and folds down into a very convenient travel size into the water proof carrying case. Great value, glad I bought it. 
416 Works as it s supposed to. 
417 Great camera. Best in class for the price - although I bought my body eight months ago at $550 and now a kit is $499 - I feel ripped off. 
418 Great item for a great price Angel Vidaurri 
419 Grandson was very happy with the stand 
420 Had it set on a time to run during the day. Stopped turning on after 3 months. 
421 Everything fine, useful as expected & good delivery service... 
422 This battery works well lasting two hours of non-stop time lapse. 
423 The microphone is not sensitive enough to be an effective baby monitor. Also the app that must be used with this camera is not very user friendly. 
424 Try to measure the LCD first before you buy any. 
425 I love it 
426 haven t tried it yet, its on the bike but haven t put my cam on it and went for a ride yet. 
427 Nice strong transmitter would buy again 
428 I love it! And real leather so it s awesome :) I really recommend people buying this case because it looks cool and it protects your Camera. 
429 It worked well and even though I lost a motor in a crash. I recommend this for beginners. I m very happy that I installed them. 
430 It s a good clock for telling time, but not for spying. 
431 Great camera bag. Plenty of space for my EOS plus all 3 lenses and a digital camcorder. 
432 Henry was very helpful. He set everything up for me and it only took about 15 min. He also showed me how to set up and use the app on my phone. This is a great camera. 
433 Does not fit go pro 4 black like advertized ended up breaking my 499 dollar camera trying to make it fit-- horrible do not reccomend 
434 Gave me the confidence that our new underwater camera would not be lost while snorkeling. 
435 thanks 
436 Perfect solution for additional backup power for my nikon dslr. More than double the price of the no name aftermarket brands available, but it does work as described. 
437 A really great way to carry your camera safely while on the trail. I recently spent a week in the mountains and this carrier made the hiking so much more enjoyable. Highly recommended. 
438 Rock solid but HEAVY. I m 6 1&#34; and can comfortably take photos without extending the center column - I only have to lean a little. With the column fully extended, the camera platform is at forehead height 
439 I m 11 years old and I love making movies. This tripod works great for me because of it s adjustable hight and the travel bag it came with. With a cheap price it s easy to afford and totally worth your money. 
440 The excellent reviews here helped me decide.I am loving this camera for the low price and excellent quality photos. Pros and those with tons to spend may want to look elsewhere. 
441 Filter has a factory blemish in the glass. Just a small speck but who wants another speck in the picture. 
442 Very versatile. 
443 Good 
444 I have always used Cleaning Cloths and these are the best. 
445 Fantastic lens in every respect. Highly recommend this over other lenses that cost a lot more. 
446 packaged very nice, so many accessories for the deal! 
447 I m a novice, so I cannot say much about this from a technical standpoint. But I was able to use it with no problem, even having never touched a telescope before. 
448 Affordable they last more than the original batteries from my Sony a7s 
449 This are premium microfiber cloths at a terrific price. The delivery was extremely fast. 
450 Nothing worked. Returned. 
451 I read several review s before my purchase. The Canon 7D MK2 is phenomenal! 
452 Perfect, exactly as described. 
453 Everything is as advertised. Great product. 
454 Solid charger, came with a car adapter attachment which is great! Charges at what seems like an average rate based on my experience. Removable plate may come in handy if I get another camera or device that uses similar batteries. 
455 It is a perfect fit for my Sony DSC H20. It started working instantly. 
456 Good battery extended flight time 
457 great 
458 very fast 
459 works good 
460 Great for the price. However it came with no instrustions 
461 Excellent camera, superb crisp images and video. Multiple functions are easy to use and set up took only minutes, Best FPV camera of the year and the price makes it a great value too. 
462 Rugged and not bulky. Great protection. 
463 perfect size for all the accessories and nice padding to keep everything safe! 
464 Top quality product at a fraction of Canons price. Works great, with good build quality. You won t be sorry. 
465 As advertised. 
466 excellent. batterys hold better charge then I expected. 
467 Its a little small no extra doom in the bag 
468 Awesome!!! Great camera. Great price. 
469 My best purchase on Amazon!! I had been wanting a new camera for a long time. Totally impressed with the items that came with my bundle. Well packed so everything arrived safe. 
470 I install cameras for a living and this is the best camera for the money I have seen so far. The price point is incredibly low for good quality and a respectable assortment of features. 
471 Just as described online. Good buy 
472 I ve had this for a while now. Live it and it has never given me a problem! 
473 Wow, it s pretty great. Batteries charged quickly and lasted for a good length of time. And 2 for a great price. Now I don t need to listen to my husband complain about needing another battery. Thanks for the extra goodies too. 
474 Excellent for leveling a tripod. Would be great if they provided instructions on installation. 
475 Worked great! This is a great selfie stick. It s very compact and kind of folds into itself. Pairing with my phones bluetooth was super easy and took less than a minute.Worked great!It extends a good amount, and so now I can take selfies without the awkward angles. 
476 Love the pix star frame. I have bought many of these frames for gifts. Everyone loves how easy it is to set up and send emails to the frame. 
477 Awesome 
478 Very nice 
479 Incredible! A pleasure to look at. My husband and I spend a looong while on my daughter s bed just mesmerized by it. Strong and delicate at the same time. Easy assembly. Larger that one may imagine. 
480 Thanks 
481 Nicely made, works perfect. 
482 works as expected 
483 thing broke 
484 Flys very well. Arrived on time. 
485 Having a great time shooting with this lens. Easy to use and produces great shots! 
486 Excelente 
487 Great price. Time will tell if the quality is good. 
488 A complete waste of money. All photos are blurry. Shutter speed is too slow. Either spend more money and purchase a high quality waterproof camera or use a disposable underwater film camera. 
489 Works as advertised. Carries good amount of photo equipment - like the removable padded &#34;box&#34; that allows the backpack to convert to just a backpack if needed, and the zippered access from the back. 
490 Works just like I needed it to! Was really happy for the extra long cord as I work mainly with children, families, and pets which can be quick to run off in any direction! 
491 Item was as described and included all of the parts listed. Everything worked, and I am very happy with my purchase. 
492 It is a great product and it came to my door very fast 
493 good 
494 All you can Be! A+++++++ 
495 It is awful and a big mistake to buy such item 
496 Just as I expected. 
497 Great zoom, average quality, good for the price 
498 Unfortunately, I m still trying to play with the camera. It s very simple to use but I have not made the time to do so. The price is right. Have fun with it. 
499 Fine product, not sure how good this glass is but it works and my pics look a lot crispier and warm and I get to show the awesome blue Florida and Puerto Rican skies and puffy clouds. 
500 The film only works at night time. Very disappointed. 
501 Great 
502 This was one of the best products I have ever bought yet. I had to sell my siblings, house, and car to buy this but it was worth it. Jk about selling my siblings. 
503 Everything was as advertised. Thanks so much.... 
504 The video quality is great. The use of the microphone could be better. It doesn t always work. 
505 Great for the price! Even better I d say! Highly recommend! 
506 Henry took care of my camers very professionally. He was very nice and pleasant in helping me with problem. 
507 Works great with my Peak Design camera mount. 
508 Light, yet sturdy, this support system holds my heaviest backdrops without sagging in the middle. 
509 Works well, good quality but hard to avoid having bubbles. 
510 Note: this does NOT work with the DMC-TS6 camera. DMW-BCF10PP --&#62; this battery DMW-BCF13PP --&#62; what the TS5 and TS6 need (I can t erase my review, so I figured this is the least I can do to make it useful!) 
511 Good case. 
512 excellent seller and terrific sale - very fast shipping! A+ 
513 Nice 
514 Inexpensive and doing the work. 
515 Works OK, great power, but it overheats too quickly 
516 Stay away if you have a mac. No support whatsoever. I am savvy and wasted the better part of a Saturday only to have &#34;no cloud camera was found&#34; with the green lights and WPs installation failing, Stay away from this product! 
517 Worked perfectly with my Nikon DX AF-S NIKKOR 18-55mm GII. 
518 Though we have not used this article, it looks like good quality and was delivered on time. It is what we were looking for. We look forward to using it on a beach trip this month 
519 Impressive. Much better than expected. Other software available on Internet to allow this to be used with OSX. 
520 This battery is amazing! It lasts double the time as my normal battery from canon!!!! 
521 Good 
522 Works well, but the clip is about 3mm short of centering the lens on the HTC One M8. 
523 Great Price. They work great. easy to install. I will buy them again 
524 perfect adapter 
525 first one arrived broken, unable to shoot pictures, sent it back and quickly received another one. Works fine so far! My daughter loves it! 
526 Awesome system, I love that I don t have to walk over to my lights to adjust the settings. 
527 Wow didn t even come with all the pieces!!! What a shame I want my money back 
528 Well done cables. 
529 very good 
530 Fitted perfectly 
531 The screen protector fit perfectly, was easily installed, and looks good. 
532 Arrived on time and as described. 
533 It s nice to have something recognizable in all the extra stuff laying in a camera bag. A quick look at this sleeve and I know where my filters are. Pouch is a durable strong material. I don t see this falling apart any time soon. 
534 This is OEM so obviously it is good. 
535 Just like new. Works perfect. Touch screen can be difficult to use but that is normal for this model. Clear pictures, wifi and 12x zoom more than make up for it. 
536 Poor build quality and optics are poor but better than the 20-80 version. You get what you pay for. I gave them away along with the 20-80 version and bought Zeiss which are vastly superior in optical and build quality. 
537 Does everything it is suppose to do. 
538 Cable didn t work with LaView LV-KDV0404B5B cameras. 
539 As advertised. 
540 Works as described. A bit hard to install but great customer support. Main issue was Chrome browser not supporting NPAPI plug ins and needed to install newest Java version on Firefox. C6724021. 
541 Had issues trying to update firmware. Also found it not staying completely leveled when transitioning from option 2 to option 1. Had to re-calibrate often by turning on and off. 
542 The product performed exactly as advertised and met my needs very well. 
543 so far so good. sometimes it turns on by itself when it s in my purse - but i put it in a sun glass case to make sure the button doesn t push down accidentally. 
544 Good product 
545 Looked off, and it is a weaker model than the standard nitecore battery. This one is a 650 and normally they are 750. 
546 I like this light .. however where is the diffuser cloth that it said it came with???? 
547 Ok camera for the money. Had problems with the battery door. If you drop the camera you blow up the door hinge. 
548 Item is as described and works great. Prompt delivery. 
549 Perfect complement to the classic model 
550 Works perfectly with an F Stop Kenti 
551 Amazing camera and highly recommended for a beginner camera. Top notch experience with the seller as well, would buy again. 
552 Finally found what I needed! When on vacation I carry my camera everywhere. It is aggravating to carry camera and a purse. This works perfect. Has plenty of zippered sections to put everything in. 
553 The battery fits perfectly and is working like a champ. 
554 Great 
555 Advertises 12 patterns, but v only has one 
556 Can t have enough charged batteries on hand. This is great. 
557 Works like a champ! Just yank out the plastic blank, insert this and you ve got Z wave on a non-Zwave electronic Kiwkset lock. Frankly I m stunned that it was so easy. Thanks to Kwikset for the upgrade path. 
558 Greatly improves my lighting. Easy to use and store, with sufficient quality to use casually. Can t speak to its durability because of how frequently I use it, but don t see why it wouldn t last if used by the casual photographer. Great value. 
559 For $12 you get two batteries, plus a good quality fiber cloth. It shows how much it means for this company to deliver the best to it s customers. 
560 Super cute and fits in regular sized bags which is convienet. Buy extra film cause you re going to want to use this everywhere. 
561 Package arrived in good shape and as expected. Fits my Canon Rebel XSi and the rear caps fits all of my Canon lenses. 
562 i like how it clips 
563 I had to replace it after one month. 
564 I believe this is the same mic from Teelec for $17. It s ok but poor isolation means it picks up everything. If you don t need stereo the Tackstar is cheaper, has better isolation, sounds better, and uses aa batteries. 
565 Purchased this for my son, he loves it!! 
566 Lovely case. Holds the camera and memory card...and sometimes my keys 
567 Perfect fit and service! 
568 Everything seems fine. Battery charged up, fits camera. 
569 I like the tripod it s not heavy at all and I am 5 ft 90lbs. 
570 Fits great with out FZ200. 
571 Great reference quick easy and easy to understand 
572 Now I just have to learn how tho use it 
573 Love this camera. So much to learn about it. Going to take a photography class and hope to learn a lot more. 
574 This bag can hold the Nikon D60 and accessories and other &#34;bits&#34;. It is a super-fine camera bag!! 
575 Amazing that the battery area isn t big enough for the batter and you can t close the cover to the battery area. This is a poor design for this. 
576 It was great for a couple of hours then it broke at the point attached to the holder. I superglued it. After a couple of weeks it broke again. 
577 Batteries are rated at a higher level then the camera maker s battery and at a fantastic price. They charge up and run just like the OEM unit at less than 1/4 the price of a new Canon batter. Totally satisfied. 
578 design is sleek However, the overall illumination is much lower than earlier generation products 
579 Absolutely a wonderful product. Had no issues yet and really enjoy having the mobile app on my device for monitoring. 
580 Sturdy, strong and light. Keeps the camera pretty safe. No issue with the quality. 
581 Nice set, especially for the price. And bigger than I thought it would be. 
582 This works as advertised and has held up well in both the sun and rain. 
583 I works perfectly for what I need to do, which is use pro microphones with my Nikon D750 and D810 cameras. 
584 great starter drone,the pictures and video are unmatched for the price and so easy to fly(I have two now.) thanks. 
585 Very durable. 
586 Plastic is a bit cheap, but it works great. 
587 Was a gift, she uses this all the time, but was disappointed that not instructions came with this. Had to go on line and figure out where to locate them and get them/ 
588 I received 1 defective camera of 4 and that happened because the cable that comes out from the camera was broken due to the way it came in the box. 
589 Unit works fine. Instruction manual almost impossible to understand. 
590 No instructions. can t be too sure how it works. Useless to me. Without instructions, money wasted. 
591 Thanks, just what we needed! 
592 Love this! Took it all over Cancun through sinkholes and zip lines hundreds of feet without a worry! 
593 Smaller than expected. 
594 These are so much fun!! They go on the camera and come off easily. Make such a cute pic! 
595 This reflector works great speacially in the sunset it gives a really shining light to the person face 
596 Everything fits great. Light weight as well. Just watch the foam as you close it up. 
597 Gosh I love these lights. Lights like this can be super expensive but these are actually fairly cheap and offer some really nice light. Not the best build quality but hey Im in it for the lights and this delivers!! 
598 Nice case however it needs to be wrapped around a fairly beefy belt/strap for the loop on the back to really hold it in place 
599 Works great, nice clear video and not much vibration 
600 I used this for a baby video monitor. It was really easy to install and adjust. I tried another monitor mount a few years ago and hated it, this one worked perfectly, I couldn t be happier! 
601 It works well for protecting the lens while not affecting the quality of the pics on my Sony Action camera. I just wish it was more simple to put on the camera. 
602 The color s beautiful and it s holding up really well so far. I do wish the faux-leather pieces were thicker. Just looks a little flimsy and doesnt hold the pattern as well as advertised. 
603 Works good with all the working parts 
604 I had been wanting to try one for awhile. It was easy to figure out how to use. A little cord plugs into the auxiliary jack and then the handle extends. Takes good pictures! Works as promised. 
605 I have several D-link Cameras more versatile and easier to use than order surveillance this is a good upgrade. Wish it came in White ! 
606 Cheap product. 
607 Piece of junk. Maybe yours will work, but mine didn t right out of the box. On the plus side, they gave me a refund and told me to just throw it out. 
608 as expected.. great lens protection 
609 Great buy. Works perfectly, and even controls focus with half press. Outstanding. 
610 Plastic, but functional and will allow SONY product to use GO PRO Accessories. Price is very reasonable. Came direct from China, so a bit slower on delivery than other products ordered same date. 
611 Works great with my Canon 60D 
612 It s a good kit; however, the SM card is not compatible with the GE DVX1080 P pocket video camera 
613 Good quality batteries, fix perfect on my Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TX30. I am very happy with it :) 
614 Works great for my spray dog collar 
615 👍 
616 Absolutely no instruction on how to attach this mini soft box. After a few minutes of cursing the companies name, it dawned on me. Works very well. 
617 It works great!! Thanks 😊 
618 It Works...... 
619 It is nice to have the GoPro attached to the head, instead of chest, so the camera swivels with where you are looking! 
620 I expected a waterproof screen cover 
621 This is a super high quality dash camera. I am very happy with my purchase. Highly recommended to anyone that is in the market for a premium camera. Highly recommended!!! 
622 Good item. It doesn t make my hand sweat. I liked the material, really soft and comfortable. Fits my eos 5d M3. 
623 Battery has long life and charges well. No issues at all with my Canon 5D. Recommend the seller Indie Camera Gear as I received the battery quickly and they followed up with a nice personal email. 
624 I purchased tve as backups yo my original. 
625 works as described. 
626 &#34;love&#34; maybe not a strong enough word for this thing... after lugging around a really heavy manfrotto aluminum version.... 
627 Very good beginners slr camera. Very light weight and small. 
628 Great little air duster. Was extremely useful in getting an annoying hair off the mirror of my T3i. 
629 Great film. Overpriced however.. 
630 This camera is easy to set up. It works great as described. 
631 A bit too easy to fly 
632 So far they work great Item came when promised 
633 They re very cute and fit my camera lens perfectly!!! 
634 Clean clear picture, works great! 
635 Love it. Am able to spotlight Egrets in trees from about 50 yards away now in very low light. Recently got some shots of Purple martins nesting by the thousands from maybe 25 yards. See attached photo. 
636 works like original 
637 Worked fine! Just like you at a great price. 
638 Very smooth! Wish it included a 3/8 screw but I was able to pick one up at Lowes for 68 cents so its all good. 
639 this is a very high quality lens, works great with my d5300! 
640 Great. I am a food blogger but can take pictures mostly at night because I work during the day. With this box my pictures are really beautiful, seems professional! 
641 This product appears that it will do a great job for the price. 
642 Superbly designed and made. A must for DSLR users and/or photographers shooting with long lenses. This is my second one! I just returned from a two day air show and wearing two bodies with these made it comfortable and provided more functionality. 
643 Great product! 
644 It is perfect was here so fast loved it. 
645 I order a at least one pack of these every year, to keep in my camera bag. These are great quality, and a great deal! A nice touch is the email I receive from the company, after I order, to make sure that I am pleased with my purchase. 
646 This microphone is amazing..... Even brighter and stronger than dual lavaliers!! 
647 Fast delivery very nicely packaged! Impressed with how fast it charged up..very neat lil camera looking forward to recording video on motorcycle trips!! 
648 Good product 
649 Go pro kicks ass. 
650 Great. 
651 can only say nothing but great things about this! Love the footage I get when my dog plays fetch or goes swimming! 
652 Great 
653 works as described 
654 Very versatile lens. Perfect for travelling. You don t have to carry different lenses because the range of this lens is excellent. It could be a little faster (e.g. f2.0), but then the price would go up substantially. Works very well with Canon 60D. 
655 This Newtonian reflector telescope itself was quite good, unfortunately the geared adjustment assembly mounted below the scope never did quite right; making it very frustrating. Once the reflector is in position however, this reflector provides outstanding images of our earths moon. 
656 Microseven has very decent security IP cameras.Their support to fix issues is very reliable. I highly recommend their cameras for lower cost solution. 
657 Pleased with service and product. 
658 I find this to not be one of the most comfortable straps depending on the application, but that is not a fault of the clip necessarily. The mount works exactly as expected and I have no issues or concerns with it otherwise. 
659 HORRIBLE CAMERA. Takes decent photos outside but if you plan on taking photos inside be prepared to be hugely disappointed. Really disappointed with the quality of this camera. Len s cap wouldn t even stay on. 
660 did the job 
661 Minimal use so far but seems to work as needed. 
662 Meets all my needs very reliably and in quite good detail with the new camera. 
663 It works perfectly! It s easy to take and easy to use. Really love it! 
664 Amazing results. Now, the sky comes out blue with white clouds... Most so called Pro photographers do not use this product and the sky looks white on thier pictures. Our sky is not white... Nice product. 
665 in love with my camera brings 2 lenses which makes perfect 
666 Satisfied with this purchase, camera works fine. 
667 Amazing love it it fits my camera with lens 18 -55 on , a macro tube on The other side And a led light , it also have two little pockets that you can use to put some memory or extra battery, My camera is a nikon d3300 
668 This is great! Works for intended usage. Be aware the tripod should be handled with care to avoid any accidents with breaking it. 
669 great camera, now I want the newest version 
670 Love it 
671 Does not work! My router does not even see this guy and I have a powerful Trendnet AC1900. Used different freq. it s useless. Returning. 
672 hopefully I will not have to use this, but I feel safe having it..Thanks 
673 Great set, great quality, reasonable price. 
674 Look real and easy to install 
675 video is really clear and it is great for watching your house or child while away! 
676 nice 
677 Fits my monopod 
678 Works for long exposure photography. You would want to use this in low light situations. It works as it should. 
679 worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks. 
680 A extra battery for Nikon Coolpix AW 130 
681 Bruh this thing lit 
682 Very Good Product 
683 Haven t tried everything yet, but good so far 
684 ok 
685 nothing to say about pelican 
686 worth the money good quality 
687 Perfectly 
688 I used it on my astro master 70 and I was very impressed on how simple and fast I could see through it,,although I had to use with it the adapter that comes with my telescope so I can mount it on 
689 No more hitting the wall! Love it. 
690 Wow the best cams ever for the price super clear image and night Vision is super clear at night 
691 Should have a quick release rod system, very annoying to take off or move. Also does not have much height so if you have a battery grip, it will reach none of your lenses to support, even big telephotos like me 70-200 f/2.8L. Solid metal construction. 
692 The best way to carry and protect my Phanton III..... 
693 Purchased it for my 13 year old daughter. She really likes it. 
694 Excelent !! 
695 Great pages for updating my photography files Easy to use and good protection for the files. 
696 Great case! Holds everything I need and I don t have to remove the prop guards every time I m done using my drone. 
697 Works as intended, feels sturdy. Didn t end up working for me...sigh. 
698 It was supposed to be a product that when you put it on there d be no air bubbles. Not so. I tried several times. Air pockets formed every time. At least the LCD is protected. 
699 This item arrived quickly and in excellent condition. It was exactly as the way it had been described - a great complement to my new camera. 
700 good 
701 As a step up from the stock lens that came with my Canon T3i, you can definitely see a difference. Great zoom, clarity, aperture, and low price. Plus arrived SUPER FAST! 
702 This micro phone with a pre amp picks up slight audio noises. Becarful what you hear you may not want to know. 
703 You have to go online to get directions on using the camera. I m still learning all the in s and out s but the camera is a good one. And you can use a regular SD card in it, so that s good. 
704 Works great; a good value; just as good as a name brand 
705 Great case. As described. 
706 ok for the price,not a great camera 
707 GREAT PRODUCT - GOOD FAST SHIPPING - THANKS 
708 We ve found this works well for our baby monitor, allowing us to mount it on the corner of the crib, and to move it if necessary. 
709 This little thing is great, takes pretty good photo and video 
710 Not a big fan of the clear finish so this matte finish works great. Fits perfect! 
711 It didn t work for my Sony digital camcorder.. 
712 Info says the battery meter will recognize this pack, but it doesn t. It s fine for a spare. 
713 That s ok 
714 Love it thus far. Works as expected. 
715 It was awesome for the 1 hour it worked, then one of the rotors stopped working and that was that. Great fun for the little time it worked. Other than that get another drone that won t crap out on you. 
716 these batteries are for my Arlo wireless system. Exactly the same as came with cameras. 
717 works great 
718 does what it was advertised to do. 
719 The best deal. Good quality and fast delivery. Everything fits my GoPro hero 4 housing 
720 doesn t work very good 
721 great quality 
722 Just ordered this past week. works well, charged both batteries. Like the fact that it includes a DC adapter, it will be very handy on a long road trip. Very good price for an excellent product. 
723 The video quality is acceptable 
724 This case fits my Canon EOS Rebel SL1 with 18-55mm lens perfectly. The only shortcoming is that there is scant space for accessories. I can put two spare batteries in the front pocket but there is no place for a filter. 
725 Excellent product. I recommend it 100%. 
726 Good Gift. This camera case is great for the right size camera. 
727 Outstanding glass!! Not only does this lens compete with the &#34;big boys&#34;, but, in my opinion, beats the C**** 100mm/2.8 in many aspects, including flat field sharpness. The AT-X 100mm/2.8 is a contender that is worth your consideration. 
728 Works great for analog security cameras,( my application) 
729 Great when you just need that extra lens. Lots of times I don t want to carry my camera bag but want two lenses. This is small and does the trick. Perfect for street photography and outside events. Holds lens securely 
730 Works perfectly with the Panasonic FZ200. Easy set up. Will work through a closed glass window for those nature shots. 
731 I was having problems with upgrade firmware on my DVR. I called Tech support and spoke with Chris L. He helped every things what i needed. He is very great customer service. Thank you !!! Chris L. 
732 Just what I needed for my camera! 
733 I really liked this but I never got all the bubbles out. 
734 I wish I’d found this battery sooner. I’ve been looking for a cheaper BMCC power supply and this seems to be the least expensive out there. Also, it fits nicely on my rig and lasts a long time. 
735 The screen can crack easily, but it definitely works under water. Took mine to some whale shark dives; very pleased. My pictures were definitely better than the rentals the resort offered for underwater photography. 
736 It didn t work for me. Tried it with a Sony NEX7 and Canon lens and had mixed results. I could never get the autofocus to work. 
737 Great and strud for a DSLR, but the knobs/caps get loose over time. 
738 Glass screen came off after first use. Can t turn it off and it seems the connection might be intermittent since it seems to mess the shutter presses every 4-5 clicks. 
739 the advertise 53X was wrong, it is only 40X optical zoom ! 
740 does what it says, takes great pics. 
741 Very big set of GoPro Hero accessories, it includes everything you will need to use on your GoPro Hero camera adventures. Highly recommended kit. 
742 Best Camera ever I love it Great for indoors in low light Wish there were more lenses for it 
743 Everything it says it is. 
744 Excellent product 
745 Doesn t work I ve tried every battery even the orginial and the new once many times and it doesn t work 
746 Super fast delivery, and everything came as described. 
747 Ok 
748 I bought those 2 cameras and I only received ONE camera instead of 2. 
749 Excellent Camera as the picture quality is beautiful. Pointed at my front gates and no one is getting past those gates without being recorded. There is barely any light out in that area but the night vision is incredible. I would buy again if another is needed. 
750 Very good so far, but very expensive compared to others 
751 very cheap, but then again they are very fake 
752 The button doesn t click easy and there for it takes a long time to take a picture. Then it is hard to not have a blurry picture. 
753 Came in extremely fast! Awesome packaging! Great build and design. Feels good in my hands. So happy I went with this! 
754 Worked as expected. Not as hard to do as I thought. Used on a very dirty d7100 sensor. 
755 Very good works well on windshields 
756 I wear it as a headband. Comfortable; absorbs sweat & keeps me cool. Great in the car with the windows down. 
757 The head swivels very loosely. 
758 For the price it is the beat photo backpack in Amazon. Can not be beat. Many cushioned pockets for lenses and accessories, comfortable straps, scooped up the last one but hoping it will be in stock soon. 
759 Great product, great price! 
760 Doesn t fit the Sony HDR-cx900 
761 great camera, makes a great gift. 
762 Just what I needed for the video camera my father-in-law gave me as he did not have a charger. 
763 good 
764 Exactly what I needed 
765 Good price. Good quality. No problems. 
766 Great bag for my needs 
767 I bought this charger for my Canon SC280 camera. I was very pleased with the value and it works great. I would buy it again. 
768 This drone is an excellent buy. Easy to fly, easy to repair, fast, and decent FPV. Much more fun if you buy the charger that can charge 5 batteries at a time and purchase the extra 5 batteries. Also happy I bought extra propellers and guard. 
769 Good price, good quality! 
770 Performs like the original go pro battery at fraction of the price. 
771 As described except one of the light bulbs which was included was burned out. 
772 can t wait to use on vacation, I only had one battery and this is a great buy for the money. 
773 On time elinry and great srvice 
774 Ok for very short distance 
775 Canary is so perfect for me and my family, easy to use, reasonably priced, and working great. 
776 Just Great! 
777 It s OK. I just wish I had something to put in it. 
778 Excellent item 
779 I don t have anything else to say. 
780 works great 
781 Can t wait to put this to use in my classroom. 
782 It s a great little printer. So fun! Perfect for pics to add to my planner and record memories of the day. 
783 This is great for the added security needed for your GoPro and it really works great! The installation was easy and you really need the adhesive to set before using this in the water. 
784 SImply put, ...cheap ...cheap ...cheap. Don t waste your funds on this. 
785 as Described Very Pleased with my Order Thank You!!!!!! 
786 Telescoping part is very loose, makes phone spin around. Piece of garbage. Bought at Ross for 5.99 
787 Great system 
788 Package arrived quickly. The lens is great 
789 The ad needs to state that the batteries are not included but great product great price 
790 Perfect for filming when I needed great sound quality! 
791 Works great light easy to maneuver and my iPhone 6 + fits perfectly 
792 Great tripod. Lightweight and easy to use. Good price form Prime members with free shipping 
793 Worked perfect. Good price! 
794 As advertised. 
795 great 
796 Perfect size for the Canon Powershot SX700 for which I bought it. 
797 Excellence. I have 2 of these and five batteries. I cycle through them while recording. Never run out of power. 
798 Totally AWSOME! 
799 Really good product. Fast shipping. Everything fine 
800 I loved it 
801 Great! 
802 Faulty dial for the shutter button, just within a couple weeks of ordering this new camera the dial just fell off. 
803 Only complaint I have is that they re a bit difficult to put into the binoc mounts. Also, they could be a bit longer to make it easier to clip on the strap. 
804 The camera is better than I expected. It is smaller, lighter and shoots better video. I am really impressed. I haven t used a GoPro but I cant imagine the quality can be exceedingly better to warrant the 4-10x price difference. 
805 cute 
806 Works great! 
807 I lost my Nikon remote and got this one. Performs great. 
808 I love this top handle. So much better than the Honu handle I had for the GH4. 
809 The batteries held their charge for a full day of picture taking and sightseeing. They charged quickly and without issue in the charger. The included adapter for the European plug was extremely helpful. 
810 arrived on time and quality is excellent! 
811 No Problems 
812 Fun little device ! 
813 In terms of the quality of the product - it is exceptional and by far has the best image quality Sound was good as well 
814 Used this for 2 years and couldn t be happier!! very durable. I have used it in fresh and salt water. Great buy! 
815 great service, great price, superb product 
816 works well 
817 A deal for such a cool lil lense 
818 lightweight, and all the features an amateur photographer needs. 
819 Great product. Great seller! 
820 works great 
821 Works great! 
822 ok 
823 Great slider for professional video work. 
824 It works and is the same as the real Manfrotto ones. 
825 gave as part of gift bag for someone with new Go Pro and they loved it! 
826 Great deal and service 
827 👍 
828 It works to charge my bateery and I got it pretty fast. 
829 the product is great so far but the service was better. 
830 Very nice battery. Holds a very good charge. 
831 Be careful - reviews of this plug said &#34;Loved it for my QFlash&#34; = well, I didn t look closely enough, and it only has two prongs, my Quantum T5D needs three. 
832 Have been charged several times due to vacation and birthdays. Have held a good charge and long use of each battery. Will buy more before the Holidays. 
833 good product, It works very well. 
834 Had a cheap one that rattled and made me feel like the lens was going to fall off. This one is PERFECT! Sturdy and you can t beat it for the price! Great Buy! 
835 Arrived on time, great quality, I needed only 2 but it is better to have them handy. 
836 Great filter. It is very solid and well built. This is the second filter I have bought from Breakthrough and I definitely recommend them. 
837 you will get good wide angle view but in spite of adjusting all the exposure parameters, you will not see details in image. Details and sharpness is very poor. You will see lot of reviews which will say great value for price but image quality is very poor. 
838 It take great pictures and many features 
839 Great product 
840 great 
841 Everything fits perfectly into the case. Gives you room to have 5 batteries (1 in drone +4) and pocket for tablet. 
842 The product came with broken buttons for the up and down menu options. Also the watertight cases power/ mode button was broken. A quality control issue but I was still bumbed out because I wanted to use it right away. Will order another one and then do another review. 
843 Affordable mount for gopro camera BUT the screw does not keepmyour camera in th angle you want 
844 Excellent camera for the money! 
845 it is ok Does not activate far enough away and does not stay on long enough Ten feet to activate motion 
846 pricey but worth it much easier to hold the camera. 
847 It s a little small. But that s just me. This is probably more intended for essential gear you need to take with you. 
848 This is a great finder. Easy to use due to the erecting prism. I really like the cross hair patern. 
849 Got them pretty quick and they work great and easy to instal 
850 Perfect Fit 
851 good product 
852 the camera seems good but some of the accessories parts missing and not compatable. The camera is top heavy on the tripod. It tilts down no matter how much it is tighten. There was buckle missing on hand held grip. do I have any recourse? 
853 Will return to seller. 
854 Vincent was patient and awesome! I highly recommend the product and customer service! 
855 Muy Bueno 
856 A great buy. Cheap bag 
857 Super cute and good quality! 
858 Works great. 
859 Perfect. Good atention and delivered on time. 
860 This is a good grip for medium weight cameras but if u run lots of add ons like light mic and monitor the weight can be thrown off a bit but all the extra thread points make it great for multiple uses 
861 I love this camera. Unlike the other review my Minolta Hi-Matic AF2 takes regular AA batteries that are easy to find. It s a great little point and shoot camera and takes sharp photos. 
862 Stopped working after a few times in the pool. It was fun whenever it worked, though! 
863 Fit nice and snug on my GoPro 4 Silver. Filters came on and off nice. 
864 Great! 
865 This is probably the best kit you can get for the price.The packaging was great, the product and also the shipping was fast. Super happy with this purchase 
866 dose the 55-300 Nikon have a plastic or is it a stainless mount? 
867 Excellent 
868 ive had the phantom 3 pro for 4 weeks and the camera gimble is broke 
869 they don t have replacement parts and wont return after 30 days .. don t waste your money 
870 Worked great to replace the missing screw in my Sinar Pan/Tilt tripod head. This screw is used to mount a camera to your tripod head. There is a version with a 1/4&#34; screw available if your camera uses that instead of the large 3/8&#34; type. 
871 Item as described and fast delivery. 
872 Best solution for glasses wearers, unless you want to drape yourself in a cloth, like Ansel Adams. 
873 Excellent camera. Photos and video to prove it 
874 I took this lens on a trip recently and so far am very happy with it. 
875 Easy to set-up and I am not a wizard when it comes to electronics. i Just set up the monitor up and went out of town for a few days. Really nice to record if you want or just look around. Would purchase again.? 
876 Love the camera, however, the carrying case could fit tha smaller pieces of accessories. 
877 This is a great tripod for beginners. Very cheap and quality-made. It is stable and very adjustable. Very easy to set up and use. Very light. Worked perfect for shooting a large group! I bought it for my Canon camera and use it all the time. 
878 Works perfectly with my Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX50 16.2 MP Digital Camera. This case is a little bulkier than I really wanted, but it has worked out well with the attached belt loop on the back. 
879 This product is unable to be connected trough Internet for remote viewing. Even trought Zmodo it is impossible to update firrmware. When buying be sure that DVR has HDMI connections even if it indicates that comes with QR code. It was made for 
880 decent batteries, a lot cheaper than buying canon. only thing I have noticed is they don t last as long as the canon. At this price I will buy more for backups. 
881 Great camera for very good price. 
882 Yup, it fits! Very happy to find a replacement so I don t have to replace the tripod. 
883 Good product, a little pricey. 
884 Works like a charm....have scanned over 500 pictures so far and not ONE issue! 
885 Use everything in this kit, great buy! 
886 Bought this for a backpacking trip because of its light weight. Camera failed to save majority of photos. I m tossing this camera in the trash. As they say, you get what you pay for. 
887 everything works,video quality excellent and battery life last for more than 8 hrs. Only missing is night vision, video at night is grainy and need a good outside light. Night vision will really make this an outstanding dvr. 5 solid star for this dvr 
888 Very very little. 
889 Bought this as a gift for my stepson and it performed great in the water. Solid quality and build. Image quality also excellent. 
890 Lack of bottom opening access to battery and SD card is an issue. Nicely made and fits well. Binds a bit where case and strap come together. 
891 OEM and lasts just as long as the one with the camera. 
892 Junk!! Waste of money.. 
893 WORKS GREAT 
894 its pretty hard to attach my go pro as the screw is to close to the housing, but overall great product. 
895 I love this lens! Crisp, sharp photos. The Bokeh that this produces is much better than any of my other lenses and I absolutely love the auto focus override. I can utilize the speed of auto focus while being able to fine tune my shots without switching to manual. 
896 You get what you pay for.... 
897 as described fast shipping highly recommend 
898 Just big enough stretch to fit iPhone 6Plus with Spiegen Tough Armour 
899 This camera is PERFECT for beginners. 
900 good buy. on time and a expected. 
901 Fast focus, good low light, great lens. 
902 Love this. It s quick to charge, and lasts long. 
903 Buyer Beware: After purchasing this, I begun getting spam email from SterlingTek. 
904 Keep s my lenses safe. 
905 Just as shown 
906 Configuration is somewhat challenging to determine how the various components can fit into the slots, but it s doable. Very sturdy/ 
907 It s a bag....it holds all my Canon lenses....as well as one body.....snugly. 
908 Good items! 
909 Great price, got the job done. Versatel! 
910 Bot cords, the power cord and the backup camera cord are too short. Cannot hide the cords. Don t let them say otherwise. I have a Honda Accord, and both cords are too short. Mirror also vibrates a little when driving. So I will lengthen the cords by soldering them. 
911 Good camera for the money. The image is very clear and the night vision is bright and effective. 
912 This charger works quite well, love the display and the ability to swap charging amperage so I don t burn out my smaller cells. 
913 Henry ,good and work find ,got good tech support from foscam, it is a good camera! works great. 
914 Awesome camera. Took it to Jamaica and the pictures are absolutely beautiful. Thanks 
915 GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT PRICE. GREAT SERVICE. 
916 Nice strap, no instructions for installing. 
917 Arrived ahead of schedule and worked as expected. Good service and good value. 
918 Lens works well. However lens case is too small and lens won t fit in it. Lens hood is not included. It was delivered sameday. Packaging was great. 
919 just got it. It works on my old camcorder. very happy 
920 I am able to haul this with my backpack camera case. 
921 I rate 4 star my son told me that is really good deal 
922 Works great. Sturdy, yet light weight. And, the Pahntom fits with the prop guards on! 
923 Thank worked great. 
924 Bought it to put it in my Mav 88, It s ok.. 
925 The camera works well when tied directly to the router, but will not sync wireless. 
926 Very good! 
927 These work well but they don t look very appealing. I was able to take pictures and video with ease. However, it doesn t record for long. 
928 Great bag, great value. The dividers are all customizable. It does take time to arrange the dividers for a good fit though. 
929 Nice little TV for the car and has an HDMI input. The colors aren t the best but good enough for my kids to use it with their Wii U on road trips. 
930 This thing really works 
931 Perfect fit for a good price. I ve not tried the tripod yet. 
932 Excelent equipment 
933 it feels cheap the tripod stand is so tiny you cant set it on rocks to get a higher view 
934 Used for rockets and worked extremely well. 
935 These work just as good as my old Canon ones did for my 50 D. And I like be that there were three in this pack also the price is excellent. 
936 Seems fine, I haven t had a chance to really check it yet, like I want. Thank you. 
937 Threads were so badly created during manufacturing, the thing won t work at all. Total junk from day one. 
938 Excellent camera. Very user friendly. Great under water photos. WIFI photo transfer is quick and easy. Super product! 
939 Love it.......... 
940 This was a deal and it works very well. Thanks! 
941 Product overheats under reasonable use (1-2 hours), making it completely unsuitable for professional use. Was using this for a high-profile shoot with a celebrity and it started flickering and turning on and off every second. Ruined the scene and embarrassed the crew. Faulty product and should be removed from Amazon! 
942 Ably and amply holds my Sony A6000 with larger lens attached. Standard lens and wide angle lens fit comfortably and easily (even with Neoprene cases) in side pocket. Lots of other pockets for sundry items. It is larger than you would think, but gets job done for me. 
943 DREAMY!!!! I love this!! We ordered three of them to cover the walls of a 10x20 tent and we got so many complements! Very nice quality and I love the pocket at the top for a rod! Made putting it together a breeze! 
944 It is my carry everywhere camera! Love it! 
945 I was interested in the Arca Swiss quick release feature and didn t need the Olympus battery/control of their accessory. This works perfectly. Finish and fit are perfect. An added bonus over the Olympus add-on is that the battery and memory card can be accessed without removing the base. 
946 Cool....... 
947 This LCD protector: This protector was useless, without adherence to the screen of my Alpha 77 II and the bubbles made it impossible to display the same. It was necessary to dismiss it, total loss. Excuse me. 
948 It worked great. Thank You... 
949 Great 
950 Good... 
951 i love this camera it will notify you if heard a sound or movement also it will email you setting can be changed 
952 Perfect battery... perfect seller! 
953 fine 
954 Great action Camera 
955 Bought this item for the same reason I purchased the small gold/silver mini reflector. (To photo small collectibles) Easy one handed operation for that little extra light one sometimes needs. 
956 Product worked perfectly for my purposes (replacing original factory battery for Olympus Stylus 1050SW). Battery is actually slightly more powerful than the original. 
957 Bought this for my daughter-in-love for her birthday. She absolutely LOVES it. So it works as she expected it to. 
958 Always good to have an extra battery...And here you get two batteries and a great charger. Never leave without a backup fully charged battery when going to shoot your awesome pictures. 
959 Good if you don t drop it! :) 
960 It was exactly what I ordered. Works just fine. 
961 Stay away. This program for product is awful and takes FOREVER 
962 Great kit! Perfect for use with the gopro hero2. It has everything my son needs to get him started making great videos. 
963 This was a great birthday gift for our daughter, she took it to an outward bound week and it went white water rafting, under water in the case and did fine. We are really impressed with the picture quality and would definitely recommend. 
964 Great little lens! It s so wide that it s sometimes hard to keep your feet out of the shots. 
965 One blade stopped working after three days. Have not been able to use it since. 
966 Having a hard time getting it to work but pretty cool item 
967 I use this lens on a D750. My photography experience is very limited but I am enjoying myself. I use this lens for landscapes. 
968 Exactly what I was looking for. Now I will never run out of battery again. 
969 One problem....there is no information to refill the pen ink when it runs out. Now I have a pen that does not write anymore. Thanks seller! 
970 Excellent camera!! Received it within a week of ordering it. 
971 Great to have 
972 Works great with my Nikon batters and makes storage of them so easy!! 
973 Best gift ever. My son used it all summer long in Florida Very easy to use and great picture/video 
974 Very good quality and speed for the price 
975 Was not impressed with video, there was no per say instructions and no phone number to contact for support 
976 It s neat but I wish it didn t save only to .MOV files. 
977 Great product! 
978 very good product. My Asus R.O.G. 17.3 fits very well. And the charger also and a cordless mouse 
979 very good 
980 Not designed for someone with arthritic hands. My niece seems to like it 
981 Product was as advertised. 
982 Works Good, Great Value! 
983 Really cute camera. 
984 This is my 3rd device. Easy to setup. Video lead to the capture of 2 people who burglarized my neighbor 2 doors down. 
985 It was exactly what I was looking for 
986 Excelent price，unbeatable combo. 
987 So so... 
988 Just what I needed 
989 Great sound and picture for such a small unit. Battery and switches are a bit touchy on occasion. 
990 Works great! 
991 Everything is good 
992 I bought the small and it is a great size and easy to pack in my backpack. I own a sjcam sj5000 (gopro clone) and it fits perfect. Great product and reasonable price. 
993 Works fine. 
994 Completely satisfied with the quality of my order. 
995 Excellent 
996 GREAT BUY 
997 Very happy!! 
998 The lens cap is functional and works just fine but the hood lens doesn t quite fit properly. It has fallen off already. 
999 Exactly what i wanted, great price, quick shipping 
1000 Nice kit. Exactly what I needed for my camera. 
1001 Love all the features especially the motion sensor when I walk into the room. Nice display. Easy to use. 
1002 Broke after two weeks. 
1003 This was a wedding present for my grandson and his wife. They love it. They promised me pictures to come in the years ahead! 
1004 Perfect for what I needed!! 
1005 Used to have a 10 x 50. This is great...just a little havier for brid watchers... 
1006 Works great. 
1007 Its alright,as first camera. I needed it for YouTube videos. But audio not so great. I have to talk loud for recording. Video quality is great though. 
1008 Works ok color is really poor but for the money its ok 
1009 A cheap filter isn t worth the loss in image quality. 
1010 instructions are terible have not found any good ones online yet not shure how it will work need better instructions 
1011 Works great! 
1012 great 
1013 Good price! 
1014 The plastic thread is horrible, I tried it on my different lenses and I can t get it to work properly. You can t really tighten it up as the plastic won t allow it. Just a waste of money! 
1015 great 
1016 Beyond its entertainment values, Baywatch has enriched and in many cases helped save lives. - David Hasselhoff 
1017 sturdy! my wife loved it!!! 
1018 Thanks for including good specs, it fits well! 
1019 Pretty frustrating. Frankly, just didn t work. hold the button, red light comes on with blue light, goes out, never able to get a single frame of video recorded. Instructions read like an old Japanese Godzilla movie script... Not playing with this one anymore, sending it back! 
1020 Does not work 
1021 im not happy, the cable gets out. need a stronger closer 
1022 So far so good. I ve been using it for macro work and it works great. Anytime you need a shot when you fear touching the shutter will throw everything off, this is for you. Worth the money. 
1023 doesn t fit as original one fits, cap is falling off quite often 
1024 Excelent 
1025 Will return to seller. 
1026 Keep these in the camera bag as backup. Seem to work fine. 
1027 I wanted to like this camera, but sand got under the shutter button the very first time I used it at the beach. Back it went. If you need something for the pool and not the beach, this would work great. 
1028 This camera is amazing. The images are crisp, and the camera is easy to use. 
1029 Nice case 
1030 Looks pretty good! Worth the price! 
1031 Do not buy this. I didn t even receive the same model as in the description and it barely worked. After the first time I charged it, it worked for ten minutes and now nothing. What a disappointment. 
1032 They are not following through or doing what they claim. For two months now they said they were couldnt fix but would pay out the claim. Nothing they said has been true. No camera returned and no payment 
1033 wasn t impressed with it, doesn t find focus that fast. returned the next day 
1034 Love it! 
1035 like it 
1036 Fits my Nikon D3200 and any filters I have on the camera. Good price and fast shipping! 
1037 Very satisfied arrive as promised and was easy to set up support was great 
1038 love it 
1039 Same as the battery that came with the camera and lasts a very long time. I used this in my Nikon D5500. 
1040 Shipped quickly and exactly as described. Great deal, thank you! 
1041 Attached to my deck rail to install the Netatmo rain gauge. Works well. 
1042 So far so good! Have had these batteries for only a couple of weeks, but so far so good, They do the job. 
1043 I already used it on my glasses and on my TV screen and it does what it promises. Great product. Will recommend this product 
1044 The strap was a tad large but it held the camera securely during my horse back riding excursions and regular pool play. 
1045 This thing is brill! 
1046 Items for my friend and my family arrived well packaged and earlier than estimated delivery.We take it for family use to record cherished moments. After a few days usage, I really think it is worthy to recommend to you.It is really funny and useful device. 
1047 Looking at it now and works well 
1048 Nice everybody like exploration 
1049 I have not used the very much. I am still experimenting with them. However I am satisfied with them so far. I do not expect to have any problems with them. 
1050 Worked exactly as advertised. Great product! 
1051 disappointed that it was plastic petal after being reviewed as ALL metal. focus is pretty stiff. not tack sharp... 
1052 Loved this case! It worked perfectly and did the job. Pelican makes a very good product. Shipping was awesome and fast. 
1053 Unit works well and is OK. I should have read description more carefully because I would really like a battery operated unit. 
1054 amazing product 
1055 Was shipped faster than stated. Very pleased with purchase. 
1056 Didn t work right. Pictures were blurry with lens attached to camera lens. 
1057 It does what it is designed to do. It s not very portable as you have to disassemble it every time. Once you figure out how to do it it s ok. You could easily put your eye out if one of the rods slip out of your hand. 
1058 Great product. Easy to install. 
1059 Great product at a very affordable price, kept my camera nice and dry when we got caught out in a storm unexpectedly last weekend. 
1060 exactly as described. works great would buy again 
1061 Still learning how to use this but it is very well made. I see it as having the potential to really improve my moving shots. 
1062 Battery would not charge 
1063 Ok but I m still not relaxed enough to use it!!!! 
1064 Pretty easy to fly I m a beginner and once I could once I figured out the software it was pretty easy 
1065 Works pretty good 
1066 Do not buy this product. It stopped working after a few shots. I bought tried out, the next time I pulled it out of the bag it quit working. 
1067 I have a 3+ and realized the itch on the original case cracked right before a trip so I ordered this one. Fits my 3+ perfect and has a different style latch so we ll see how that does. Shipped fast 
1068 This camera works great, used the 44 optical zoom with great clarity. The only drawback is there was no software or user manual but I downloaded the manual from the website. I would recommend this product to anyone and I am very satisfied with my purchase. Thanks! 
1069 Very sturdy for the cost - I was surprised. Not enough for my Nikon D700, but *perfect* for my Sony a6000! The built it ball head is great, too. 
1070 cant go wrong. Excellent product for protection and peace of mind 
1071 Arrived broken 
1072 Bought two and gave one for a gift. Neither one was usable due to the Go Pro screw not being able to tighten all the way. The unit will not stay in position. 
1073 pule s*** 
1074 Great Pole buuuut its too expensive! The thumbscrew seems poor quality 😒 anyways i like its transparent😀 and Looks beautiful 
1075 Works great with my Sony a58 camera. I wish it had a power button though so I could turn it off when I wasn t using it. 
1076 It s very good , clear and works wonderful. I thought it was a little bigger but works great. 
1077 Birthday gift for my son. He really liked it for his voice recorder. Fast service. I actually received it sooner than expected. Great job 
1078 This did not work for my Canon T3 even though it said it would. I m disappointed. 
1079 It was perfect. Thanks 
1080 Just what I needed 
1081 Pleasure doing business with! Everything as promised! 
1082 This camera worked fine...until I updated to Windows 10 then it didn t work. Disappointing 
1083 My brother is a photographer and loves it. Uses it all the time for different kinds of shoots. 
1084 Quality and price very good. 
1085 As a wide angle lens for the Nikon 1 V2 this lens performed very well giving great color rendition and pin sharp photographs. 
1086 Unlike anything you ve ever experienced 
1087 Effective, light weight, great quality and compact. Will easily collapse and fit in the case it comes with. Great to create highlights or a catch light for one person. 
1088 As advertised 
1089 Works very well. This really helped us see what our dog was doing during the night. He is having health problems and it helped to see his behavior all night. 
1090 good 
1091 Easy to use, video and audio quality is very poor. 
1092 piece of s*** 
1093 works PERFECT!!! ARRIVED VERY QUICKLY!! 
1094 What a great package deal. The DJI P3 is one awesome quad. Just add a case and a cell phone or tablet and you are ready to have the time of your life. It is fast and responds very well. The pictures and video are impressive. 
1095 Good product, delivery on times, I like it ! 
1096 It came just in time for the vacation trip to Sedona, Arizona. With a 20-50mm kit lens, the pictures was amazingly clear and sharp color rendition. 
1097 The charger only charged the battery 2 bars and completely died in 40 minutes I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!! 
1098 my last camera bag.. 
1099 Best Photo gear I own. 
1100 exactly as advertised. shipping was a bit on the slow side, though. 
1101 Exactly what I needed. Fast delivery! 
1102 works flawlessly with HDMI. Use it with media device as well as computer. 
1103 Product was great arrived on time and was packaged sufficiently, it didn t solve my problem which was my internet connection itself but it worked great and did as i needed it to 
1104 Works as well as a new OEM battery should. 
1105 Amazing lens!!!! Highly recommend 
1106 Very nice quality. 
1107 Great for the price 
1108 Worked perfectly as described - my kids and I loved being able to let our waterproof camera bob around in the water and not worry it would disappear! 
1109 Works very well, positions camera in a good spot and holds it there. 
1110 Like all the other reviews, this is awesome! 
1111 The velcro came ripped and I ll need to do something about that so I can put it on my belt or something 
1112 Good deal. Warranty card wasn t included, but you can easily register on the Canon website. 
1113 It works good. Just what I needed. 
1114 Lesson learned; look at the length of the stick. This one is a little short which I was a little disappointed. Yet Ive learned to play with it and captured a good shot. 
1115 Excellent 
1116 This camera is exactly what I wanted/needed. Would recommend to anyone needing a point a shoot. Zoom is perfect for me, color is great. Love it! 
1117 Love this thing. Brought it with me to bandcamp and had a lot of fun with it battery life leaves much to be desired but photos arebshotnin 4000x3000 and video in 1920x1080 so I can t complain much. 
1118 works good and keeps my go pro secure when needed. Thanks!! 
1119 Both work good! the only problem is the locking knot dose working properly, after locking in, sometime have to force to unlock it! 
1120 They do a good job of cleaning. With six of them, I have one where I need them, most of the time. 
1121 Quite frankly, I m a little disappointed in the picture quality of this camera based on the price I paid for the camera. Plus the video has to be transferred into a different format before it can be edited. 
1122 Great when you need your camera perfectly straight. Works great 
1123 Fits my camera fine and improves the imsgrs while shooting in bright sunlight. 
1124 Great buy! My 16 year old photografer is very Happy with it. Delived at home really fast. Thanks 
1125 No instructions. Camera must be in manual mode with you making all the adjustment. 
1126 It is ciik 
1127 Love this camera! 
1128 Good unit! Preforms very well at a good price! 
1129 I love it! I like the video option on the camera. Great blue color. 
1130 Came Quick. Exactly as represented! 
1131 Stopped working after several months. 
1132 ok 
1133 Received and the snaps began to pull apart one by one. The canvas is nice and the bag is roomy enough but the quality of the securing snaps is very poor. 
1134 Love the large size, great for wrapping around large cell phone to protect while in pocket. And keep another in car to wipe touch screen. 
1135 It work great. It is simple to use. Now the printer results match the computer look. 
1136 I can take pictures which is very beautiful! 
1137 This battery s work perfectly with my 6D, and my60d 
1138 Most places charge much more for these batteries, work good on my camera. 
1139 Not that effective. 
1140 Love it. It s light and sharp. Nice to go with my new a7R-II. 
1141 The single best buy I have had for my telescope 
1142 works great! 
1143 Works okay. Could be better 
1144 Broke after 15 mins 
1145 This is a good security system. The PoE is what really sold me. I had some cable runs that were long, so I used standard cat5. The cameras give a good clear image. 
1146 This device works without a hitch. 
1147 Fabulous for the price, especially compared with the Sony OEM version. Does everything at a fraction of the cost. 
1148 Love this lens. 
1149 Great security camra 
1150 My daughter was happy. 
1151 Very happy with this purchase, have too many options but I know now that make the right decision, Ultra light, very handy, very very bright, shoot nice pictures on the darkest places 
1152 Just what I needed so I could see what the GoPro was recording. Fit perfectly. 
1153 Very pleased by the performance of this little camera. 
1154 Great for taking quick snapshots and easy to carry around 
1155 Works well, packaged well and delivered faster than indicated. The only reason for the minus one star is that it has no cooling fan. It may not be a problem but I am a little worried about longevity without the cooling fan so I am going to install one myself. 
1156 This is a outstanding deal. 
1157 this is a very nice set - I was glad to have a way of recharging my camera batteries away from 120v power. I was really just looking for new and higher capacity batteries, but the charger turned out great. 
1158 Great product 
1159 I used the gold reflector with the shoot-through open for a Chicago senior session. I lovvvvvved the warm tones! I ll never used anything else. 
1160 bought this item to repair an old school wireless 900mhz. alarm system that I could not find anywhere else , shipping was very fast ,product was exactly as described thanks again 
1161 as advertised 
1162 Fits perfect, works perfect. 
1163 This is currently the single greatest bargain in quadcopter / drone. You get a Pixhawk, controller, and a very stabled, well tuned machine for an extremely competitive price. 
1164 great sound 
1165 Great Buy ! 
1166 It arrived as promised and as described. Unfortunately, I was looking for something else. My fault. I thought it was going to have more magnification. Next time, more research needed. 
1167 the buttons are small and I cant tell if I am recording or not. 
1168 It s the best buddy when I travel alone. 
1169 Works as advertised. All Olympus camera functions work. 
1170 I bought this a while ago and it doesn t even turn on I hate it not worth it save ur money 
1171 Seems to work fine, but instructions are not clear for setting up features. Box and sales brochures said the camera did NOT not include an SD disk so I purchased a separate one; but there was one in the unit when I received it. Other than that, seems okay. 
1172 A great affordable, alternative option to a pelican case! 
1173 excellent 
1174 Quality weak 
1175 As others have stated the punch out holes do not punch out easily. You end up beding the box. Would not recomend this to anyone! 
1176 I purchased this item as a holiday gift. Won t know how well the boy s like it until Christmas. 
1177 Though we used guidelines it was the wrong adapter. Unfortunately we purchased two. 
1178 works great but I rarely put on my Nikon Lenses. The camera is so small and the lenses are so big. 
1179 The package came with a chest strap, not a head strap as clearly shown. The goose neck is not very robust, the gopro-clip side broke on the first try, did not even get to use it. I m scared to use the camera holder, I m afraid it will break. 
1180 Oki 
1181 I was skeptical of the reviews, but they were telling the truth. It s all metal except for the leveling bubble. This will last me a long time. 
1182 Thing is awesome...I am bringing mine to Burning Man next week. Going to strap it on to my back and riddddddde! 
1183 great bag got it for my girlfriend she can bring her camera gear very easily when we go out 
1184 Whale watching in Alaska it was handy to have the zoom feature. Image was pretty steady even without a tripod. 
1185 Very good camera. For a small/compact camera, it does a great many things. Way better than any camera I have had before! 
1186 Very Good 
1187 great 
1188 Super easy and fast set up. Great picture quality. Great/simple phone app. Excellent range of view. Wish you could record video locally but subscription is reasonable price. 
1189 Had it for 2 months and it is amazing at everything! 
1190 Came exactly as promised and works just like original. 
1191 good design - very functional 
1192 I hate this pole. If fills with water every dive (I ve logged 50+ in the last year). Also, you can t extend it underwater if needed. I would recommend another. 
1193 I love it 
1194 Items received on time and as described 
1195 Excelente. 
1196 Very nice case for the DJI Phantom 3. It is sturdy and seals up really well with 4 latches. The case has a pressure equalizer which is very important when traveling. It is also very roomy. 
1197 It s Perfect! Worth The Purchase and the price ! 
1198 Excelente. 
1199 Got lens error on third use! Do not purchase!!! 
1200 I use this to record for YouTube. And for this price the quality is very high. I m pleased. 
1201 Great power output 
1202 need more room. side pockets are small. 
1203 Well made and a great design. 
1204 Bought one for recording my instrument playing. Really love it. Light weight; sturdy; About 4ft Great product 
1205 It is very nice , I like it a lot. 
1206 best deal for film! 
1207 Great buy and was delivered fast. So glad i found this to protect my camera when not in use. Great deal. 
1208 It functions well enough but it is too short. When I use it I get a sore neck. 
1209 Awesome 
1210 Received as new 
1211 Not much to say here, works as expected. 
1212 Good product 
1213 Sensor works great. Chimes are loud. However, there is no way to set the chimes to a continous mode. I would prefer something that requires me to turn it off. This product is perfect for a retail situation to know if someone has walked in your store. 
1214 great camera and easy to use. Nice features. 
1215 As advertised 
1216 worth the money 
1217 This may work perfectly with most cameras. But it was worthless with my Pentax K5 and K3 ii. Just acted weird. I tossed it in the trash. Pity. 
1218 Muy bueno 
1219 this camera introduce a loud noise to my PC .... I can t solve this problem 
1220 Awesome camera want a few more 
1221 Thank you 
1222 A must have for any camera bag. It s good enough for everyday shooting and cheap enough to replace if it should break. 
1223 Love it, and it fits my camera perfectly 
1224 Arrived on a slow boat from China but everything works like it should. 
1225 Worked well with my camera, thanks. 
1226 I often leave my DSLR home. I have made great vacation videos with this. I use one charger and most of my electronics use AA batteries. Something that is not easy to find these days. 
1227 Buy original Canon parts. This part will not stay on my camera. I have given it a few months and every single time I pull my camera out of my bag, the eye piece is missing because it just falls off. Does not fit 5DMk3 correctly. 
1228 Haven t used it too often as yet, but seems to add a multiple of camcorder hour use in comparison with the smaller OEM battery that came with the Panasonic camcorder. 
1229 Battery life is short. 
1230 Excellent transaction! All was as promised 
1231 Works as advertised. Charges my Nikon batteries. 
1232 Wow, this picture is great for the money. 
1233 I wish I hadn t bought it because every time I have to change the battery it turns into a whole process to remove the cover. 
1234 Wrks 
1235 Makes shooting pictures for a still image so much easier for the unsteady hand. 
1236 love it. my 1st Tamron lens, getting a fish eye lens extension for it as well. 
1237 Henry was very helpful and fixed all my problems. My Foscam FI9803P is working well again. 
1238 Well made and works well. I did find that wearing the pack caused my lower back to get sore. To remedy this, I used the shoulder strap to help support the weight of the bag.... as I should have from the start! 
1239 I would recommend an actual finder scope, but if you need a reflex finder the reviews clearly indicate that the Telrad is the way to go. I have this one, and it works OK, but that s about it. 
1240 Difficult for an amateur 
1241 the selfie stick is horrible. lots of the screws dont fit easily. The clamps dont fit easily. but you do get what you pay for. every thing works, i just had to brake it in. 
1242 Love it! use it for action sports 
1243 worked well for about 6 months, and then something inside popped, and now it doesnt work. the warranty is a lie, as yognuo customer service doesnt exist. just invest in a higher quality flash and save yourself the time! this is my 2nd one ive burned thru this year! 
1244 CMOS sensor is much improved. Impressed with the auto focusing speed of the video capture and its quiet. Pictures are sharp in lightroom. Solid for an intermediate camera 
1245 Coolest thing since sliced bread!! Amazing product, I highly recommend this! 
1246 great 
1247 Just I expected - works great and looks terrific! 
1248 Perfect for my Minolta 49 mm lenses. I don t use the tethers because, at this price I ll risk losing one now and then to avoid the lens cap dangling from the camera. 
1249 Great for what I needed it to do. Thanks! 
1250 nice gift 
1251 ;) 
1252 Arrived on time and in perfect working order. Would use them again. 
1253 It works OK. 
1254 Still using them. Great product. 
1255 Have had my strap on my canon for about 6 months now. I adore it! 
1256 Working just as great as the the original... 
1257 Great product! Fast service. Works perfectly! 
1258 great 
1259 Works perfectly with no degradation of quality. 
1260 Works perfect in my camcorder. 
1261  
1262 Great value along with a one year warrantee and information to contact the seller via e-mail and web if you have any issues. Great daytime pic and much improved night vision as well. Will be buying more soon. 
1263 Can be carry on as a case or a back pack which is convenient. Very light as mentioned. All accessories including drone with props and prop guards fit in all in place well supported. 
1264 I am using this case for my Hasselblad 500c along with 2 backs, a viewfinder, Zeiss light meter and two rolls of 120mm film. I feel protected with my equipment. I have also spoken to Pelican reps in California and have been satisfied with their customer service. A win-win. 
1265 Consumes batteries too much 
1266 This works great. It keeps the camera dry and easy to access all the components. 
1267 Love it take great pictures !!! Something that u have to have 
1268 Very disappointing, did not work as good as advertised. Camera works ok as a monitor but trying motion recording is poor at best. 
1269 Thank you very much! 
1270 Works great no issues 
1271 Protection for my camera. 
1272 great products. Thanks 
1273 Love it 
1274 Meh. 
1275 I am very impressed with the quality and design. The comfort design for the shoulder (padded very well) will make for enjoyable photo sessions as I enjoy hiking while taking photos of Nature. 
1276 Great Item. Highly recommend. 
1277 Super easy to install and setup. Much better than the older versions of their systems. 
1278 This item is sturdy and holds tight without being uncomfortable on my children. I have kids ages ranging from 1 to 6 and they all loved it. I got some amazing and adorable footage using this mount. 
1279 The tripod would be great for a small camera. This doesn t hold my DSLR camera real well. The legs want to slide out from underneath the camera. 
1280 Did its job. 
1281 returned it due to bad photo quality .. 
1282 Strap broken. Good while lasted. 
1283 for some reason the batteries dont last very long.. i buy i kit of 3 pieces and one of them drop the shoe metal part.... 
1284 it s alright 
1285 Works great. The little stand broke pretty easily when it fell from a desk onto carpet. But it still looks good in a simple frame holder that I had. 
1286 I purchased this for a Nikon D7200. The first one that was sent out defective, but they made good on it with a return. I am well pleased with it. It fits great and is thicker than I anticipated, plus it came with a small one for the control panel. 
1287 The product arrived on time and as described. Great to do business with you. Thanks Rusty 
1288 Us this to mount a 7&#34; monitor to a Canon Vixia S20 Mini Hot Shoe. Works Perfect. 
1289 This met all our expectations! It is so easy to change attachments and the directions help to figure out what piece goes with what attachment. Highly recommend this kit for anyone looking for an affordable kit for the GoPro! 
1290 Super system, quick to install and peace of mind. 
1291 Great life saver for your Nikon DSLR. No more nervous shooting waiting for your main battery to die! 
1292 Once I receive the cameras and hook them up it was very easy to hook them up and they worked as good as I could hope that they would ! I have no issues and I would purchase them again ! 
1293 Great! Just for wrong type of camera. 
1294 This is a great deal and highly recommend it because you WILL need extra batteries. You can never have too many! 
1295 Works great other than quite a few false alarms tweaking its location may help that we will see 
1296 Love this backpack! ! Plenty of room for all my gear. 
1297 Great deal works awesome! 
1298 fell off all the time 
1299 Good price point and does what it s suppose to do. 
1300 Works good. 
1301 The film is hard to find and certainly did the job that we intended. Would gladly purchase it again if needed. Pierce Camera price is not cheap, but fortunately in this case, you do get what you pay for. Five stars. 
1302 Smaller then expected but not to bad wish I got a bigger once... Not bad for the price! 
1303 Great! Snug fit, very heavy duty case. 
1304 Like this charger better than one that came with camera 
1305 The fit is a bit clunky compared to the original -- but it does work. 
1306 Terrible! Barely fits and doesn t show good quality. Very disappointed. 
1307 fits firmly basic lens cap 
1308 perfect fit 
1309 The Targus version works better, but this one s OK. 
1310 Very happy with the quality of this strap. The Leather is soft and high quality. It also included two metal rings and small protective leather pieces which I hadn t noticed in any of the product descriptions. Shipping was quick! 
1311 Great camera. Timely delivery. 
1312 Cameras stopped working after a few months. 
1313 Love my new square compact camera! It s cute, made in Japan, and has one of the best resolution and display of the compact cameras market! 
1314 Very good quality! Looks great! 
1315 Works well 
1316 I don t like it 
1317 It doesn t work 
1318 Great product, worked well. 
1319 Works with my Sony Action Cam. This bag of trix is really helpful with accessories and attachments for the Sony Action Cam. Since Sony does not make a lot mount accessories I purchased this and worked well! 
1320 Ok. Not worth the time. Just get a macro lens. 
1321 Very good quality. Love that it has audio. Really love that i can watch it from my phone! ! Fanatic cam!! 
1322 This is my electronics travel bag for trips. Perfectly carries all my gizmos and camera with great multi compartments and sections for everything! 
1323 Just what I needed. Not the brightest one, but serves my need. Excellent quality. 
1324 All my life I have wanted a good Nikon SLR camera, MY wishes have finally come true. Absolutely love it. 
1325 Great buy! 
1326 cannon eos rebel t5 DSLR camera I have to lean this camera its been a while sine I used my eos rebel 35 mm camera so this one is new to me 
1327 Great Rig Works As Advertised! Good Build Quality For The Money. 
1328 The plastic buckle snapped in half when latching the case closed. I ve only had this for about four months. I ve just purchased an aluminum one, I hope it last longer then this one. 
1329 It s ok. A bit awkward. 
1330 Very grainy video. Not an original sj4000 as advertised. 
1331 DVR has good quality recording and was able to set up app on android phone for remote viewing with no issues. 
1332 I can turn on/off the shed security flood light from inside the house at 110 feet away. My double pain hurricane proof windows did not adversely affect it s performance/range. 
1333 Product has lower quality material and workmanship 
1334 Fuzzy picture, more like a toy! 
1335 Inexpensive filters that do a nice job 
1336 Great camera 
1337 Excellent Flash. Output was amazing. 
1338 This is my &#34;go-to&#34; camera for everything photographic. I like it because it does everything Sony says it does. Also, it takes all my old Minolta autofocus lenses with no problems. Saved me a lot of money in that regard. 
1339 Decent camera with good options. 
1340 Nikon IS the BESTthat IS a fact. And for this little GEM of a camara, I cannot express how vivid the clarity in the pictures are!. The ease of use, zoom, edititing for even more beautiful pics, and an ALL OUT 5 STAR Camara! LHH 
1341 #1 it works great for CCTV CAMERAS 
1342 Lots of acc. for little cash and pretty good quality for the money. I have not had a chance to try the suction cup mount yet. 
1343 smart way of standardize the power adapter. good value and quality! 
1344 Exactly what I ordered, durable, and compatible with what it claimed. Couldn t be happier with this no brainer purchase. 
1345 does not fit my camera 
1346 Epic 
1347 Nice basic cam bag. 
1348 I placed the order yesterday, it arrived today, everything was as described, and no missing items. Perfect order. 
1349 Heads above the cable that came with the camera! (BTW the camera is a $600 camera). 
1350 Love it for semi pro use. 
1351 Got this product for my 12 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it!!!! Highly recommend this product!! 
1352 The camera works nicely with my iPhone and I m able to remotely control it as advertised. Foscam Customer Support was very helpful. Danny assisted me with clarity and precision. 
1353 Very good! 
1354 Lost mine, had to buy another. 
1355 Nice 
1356 good 
1357 Good 
1358 excelente 
1359 I recommend, fast delivery. very good 
1360 Worked great. No problems and yes, they do show the battery monitor. 
1361 My camera did not sink to the bottom of the ocean. Mission accomplished. Use two with your one camera for extra buoyancy. 
1362 I do not trust the reliability of the suction. My camera is very valuable to use this. 
1363 Barely worked at all before dying completely. Wast of money. Find something else. 
1364 Does what it says it does 
1365 I bought this used. But surprisingly there wasn t any scratch on the lens nor there was any sign of use. It was like new!! performance is as expected. Satisfied. 
1366 Thank You! 
1367 Thanks. 
1368 Worked great and kept its charge. Also loved the extra charger (although it does take longer to charge than if it is on the camera charging) and other extras it came with. 
1369 works well for my ipad and phone. 
1370 in a pack of 10 shots, 2 were defective. I paid full price for only 8 shots... 
1371 Solid every bit as good as a GoPro, took a ton of vacation videos and photos including under water with no issues. 
1372 A nice step up from my K5IIs which finally gave out after taking close to a half a million bracketed shots. I like this camera body enough that I think I will keep from throwing it into the ocean. 
1373 Item missing 
1374 Ya gotta be careful applying it but it is the ideal product to protect your screen and at a great price to boot ! 
1375 Does not record many videos on motion activated and shuts off, even after charging for 2 days, lasts about 4 hours 
1376 Great Product 
1377 Wasn t what I expected it to be 
1378 Love these. I ve had them for 2 years now with no issues. They work with both of my off camera flashes. 
1379 This is a tool I should have bought years ago !! This has saved me hours of cursing and scratched lens rings.. 
1380 Awesome 
1381 A great head for dslr 
1382 excellent perfect 
1383 Excellent price and fast delivery. One of the best optical zoom cameras you can get. 
1384 I purchased this for my wife and she loves it. It was just as shown in the ad. All good equipment and of top quality. 
1385 Works great as intended! Even used it in conditions where there is condensation and even though it gets a little damp, no issues yet. 
1386 Good flash, great alternative if you re on a budget! 
1387 just great 
1388 Awesome! 
1389 This product is rediculouse it doesn t even focus properly. 
1390 Meets my needs for storage of Memory Cards 
1391 great camera. Took on our vacation and worked great. 
1392 The zippers look cheap but until now they are working great. I have made a inside foam core to arrange my stuff. 
1393 Be sure to test. Lost my waterproof camera the first time it was used on the river kayaking. One would not even slow it down as it sank out of sight. 
1394 Does exactly what it is supposed to do--distribute the weight of camera and lens more evenly, making them appear lighter when walking around. Simple one handed operation easily lifts camera to eye level for use. 
1395 Great ip camera have 3 of these and one of the 720p cameras work great and would recomend sight hound software for pc to anyone with these cameras 
1396 I think the hardware is great but the software is complete trash. This device is unsuitable for security due to the fact that the motion detection has not been enabled in the app yet. Push notifications for motion detection does not work. Returned and refunded. 
1397 Great kit for the price 
1398 Good price, my daughter loves it. 
1399 Dont buy this due to use product not even brand new! 
1400 Great product at a great price. Fits my Nikon CoolPix perfectly. 
1401 was ok nothing special 
1402 Gets my white balance in check when I film. Very useful if you make videos or if you shoot portraits in uncontrolled lighting environments. 
1403 held up nice at the beach and on kayak trips 
1404 Good lens, met my expectations. 
1405 Thank you 
1406 Comfortable to carry, well thought out spaces inside. Seems pretty robust. I bought this via a friend in the US: I wish they sold them in the UK! 
1407 Was exactly what I paid for and received this item quickly! 
1408 it broke 
1409 Great 
1410 Everything they said it was, fun to fly and takes great pics 
1411 This fan was not anymore powerful than a $20 box fan from Walmart. Way over priced. I returned it and the seller charged me a 20% &#34;re-stocking fee&#34;, totally disappointed and I STRONGLY recommend that you save your money and do not purchase this item from Cowboystudio...waste of money! 
1412 Not bulky at all and everything fits. Might be kind of snug for some people, but I would much rather have it just barely large enough for comfortably carrying. 
1413 It s OK, I was hoping it was a little smaller but it works fine functionally. 
1414 Works just fine. No problems. 
1415 Crap quality 
1416 Perfect as any Canon stuff 
1417 Great camera just that occasionally my pictures do not fully or don t develop 
1418 Using on my Fujifilm S1. Great product. Love the quality and the price SO reasonable! 
1419 really nice, makes your cutting edge digital camera look like the legendary cameras of the fifties and sixties. Also protects delicate, not to mention sophisticated digital contents. Very nice, beautifully made, probably worth three times the cost. 
1420 when the magnet is stuck to the back of the nest cam it breaks night vision. I haven t tested with the dropcam only the newer nest branded camera. Don t buy if you want the night vision to work. 
1421 Great quality device. As most Bosch products generally are. I have installed multiples of these units and after 6+ years they are still in use today. 
1422 The cases are nice. They work nice for what I use them for. 
1423 Very nice bag, quality meets my expectations. 
1424 Good strap, seems well made, comfortable and fits the 3300d great 
1425 pictures aren t as clear as I thought they would be but could be my camera. 
1426 A little see through but not bad for the price. 
1427 Long life battery. 
1428 Excellent!!! 
1429 Just what I needed! 
1430 works well 
1431 Very cheaply made....the light itself is great but the actual piece feels like a toy. And the piece that connects to camera or hand device is very very difficult to use. 
1432 Very convenient to have these extra batteries when using my gopro. worth the money. works great 
1433 Perfect. 
1434 Works well just like the old one I had before I lost it 
1435 This is such a cool little product! I m having a blast playing with it and I m amazed at the difference in my photos. 
1436 Quality seems good, fits drone and accessories very well, foam seems good. Little steep on the price, but has made my drone use much easier. Also, this is not a bad thing, but know that it protrudes from your back quite a bit as any done backpack probably will. 
1437 still learning how to use it to it s full capacity 
1438 Nice 
1439 Better than the built in mic, not outstanding audio quality but it s an inexpensive improvement. You will likely have to experiment with your audio input controls to get the best quality and reduce hiss/background noises. 
1440 So far, it s great. Does everything I want and at such a lower price than a GoPro. All in all, THANKS 
1441 The coordinating strap with pink stripe makes it. Unfortunately, it is not included or available as the picture is shown. I returned it. 
1442 have not had to use it 
1443 beautifull kit!!!!! excellente!! 
1444 my wife is a selfie nut 
1445 Did not meet my expectations because product was poorly manufactured and was not durable. I was excited about using this product but never had the opportunity because it fell apart as soon as I attached my Gopro Hero 4 to it. 
1446 fall apart too easily 
1447 It s a really good quality harness and fit my fat dashund mix 
1448 Camera stopped working the same day it was installed 
1449 swings - very loose 
1450 the piece fit my camera with no problem will be buying another for my telephoto len thnxs 
1451 great kit for those looking to recharge batteries for box mods and several other types. 
1452 works well 
1453 We bought this for my husband s family in Kazakhstan. They love it, very clear photos with little to no effort. The camera arrived very quickly, in time for our trip. Highly recommend. 
1454 Henry was very helpful in setting up my new camera .and the camera looks really good and remote works really good very happy 
1455 Worked well I have no complaints did like the yellow tips. I received them relatively short period of time. 
1456 Great, works perfectly 
1457 Great lens, bought it for macro use with a few of my extension tubes. It replaced my 50mm f/1.8D beautifully! 
1458 great, I have had fun using these for pictures after our family vacation 
1459 xcellent by, much better than the original one 
1460 Excellent cameras and so far the best I ve had. I own 16 cameras on a two 8 camera system. Here is one of them just take 8/23/15. 
1461 Very convenient and allows you to take pics with one hand. 
1462 Excellent. 
1463 Works perfectly to My scope 
1464 haven`t had these long enough to give a true and final rating but give me a little while and I`ll let you know. 
1465 Arrived on time and looks like it work as advertised 
1466 Easy to use 
1467 This is a great kit. Includes everything to get started (and then some!). The video camera is an exceptional value for a 4k video camera. 
1468 I ve tried everything in this kit on my gopro hero. Works great. 
1469 Bought this new brand of CPL out of curiosity and found it to be of very good quality. I see no difference between this and my trusted HOYA Pro1 CPL in picture quality and the build quality is also good. Looks like this one would become my new standard. 
1470 good 
1471 Love it! Came with everything, works great! Pictures area a bit tiny but nothing I m concerned about considering I just wanted the camera for little albums of memories I can show my kids later on in life. :) 
1472 who would thought great device for studio setting or reportage 
1473 I bought this as a present for my fiancée who says she simply loves it. It does it a really good job for her, it s relatively simple to use, takes really good, clear pictures and gets the job done well. 
1474 It is a simple piece of plastic that hold one slide that lets you aim it toward the light and see the image on the film. It does exactly what I expected it to do in the simplest way possible and that is what I like best. 
1475 Truly a great lens for the price. The Nikkor 14-24 is better overall, smaller, lighter and performs better. But for $1000 more. 
1476 Great lil Light, Fast Service....Exceeded expectations! 
1477 This camera has been very reliable and fun to use. The projector aspect is ok, but not needed for my purposes. I like how compact it is and how good the quality is. 
1478 Excelente. 
1479 Works very well. The only downside I have noticed is that the pads on the clamp easily come off and can be lost. I will be glueing them on. 
1480 Geart price & quality for Gimbal head I use it with my Nikon 200-400mm. 
1481 These is a nice tripod. It s very light weight and easy to carry around. 
1482 Fit nice 
1483 Good product 
1484 A beautiful keepsake box that holds a lot. I used it to put away memorial items for my son who passed away recently. The wording on the outside says it all. I love it. 
1485 Works Perfect 
1486 Don t know how they do it this camera has it all for 62 bucks 
1487 Easy to use!! 
1488 GREAT LENS CAP....!!!...Plain and simple... 
1489 nice kit but it would have been better if it came with cleaning solvent also. 
1490 Came in very handy while diving and snorkeling, camera kind of flopped around a bit much at times though, would be nice if you could reign it in a bit while not shooting. 
1491 Excellent product, fast shipping. Buy without hesitation. 
1492 Cool I have received this product from UP Review Program. This product really bring our cellphone with a waterproof bag out of water. Its function is very nice. I m loving it. 
1493 Perfect size. Feels sturdy and does the job. Recommended!! 
1494 Cheap quality but it s a great start for me. It s not pro but it does the job. 
1495 every good batteries they last a long time 
1496 Dosent last as long as the canon batteries, but for the price a good option 
1497 Love the item and the seller. Nikon Battery arrive fully charged and ready to be used. 
1498 this battery fixed my camera and I am very happy with it. Just want to say Thank you Amazon for helping me out 
1499 Works perfectly. Now my pictures print exactly what I see on my computer screen! 
1500 This lens is really amazing! Took it our a couple nights to take pictures of the stars! I did buy it on BH. Not because of a price difference. Only because I knew for sure that I d get a new lens from BH. 
1501 Honestly I m really disappointed in this boom, or maybe my expectations where to high, don t extent it compleatly out, it will not support well. It s not terrible, but for neewer... It s not great either. 
1502 Very good frame mount, works well on my gopro hero 4. Use it everytime. 
1503 LENS LOCKED UP INTERMITTANTLY. HAD TO REMOVE BATTERY TO UNLOCK. 
1504 they dont work at all,cam wont focus no matter what lens i use,i wish i cold return it but i cant because ill have to pay for shipping. 
1505 It works! Fits my Panasonic 14-140mm f/4.0 lens (the older 62mm version... not the new f/3.5 version). I lost my lens cap somewhere in Cuba, so I m happy to have a lens cap again. 
1506 love this camera, so far so good. 
1507 I was disappointed it did not come with a lens cap 
1508 Better than gopro battery s and last longer 
1509 The cameras are good and I happy with it 
1510 Really heavy duty case great for demos! 
1511 Perfect! 
1512 Great product!! 
1513 super easy to set up! awesome quality! using it for my desk at work to display all my many photos of my son! great price too! 
1514 Beautiful item 
1515 nice 
1516 Works great but did not realize it can be harmful to the human eye. This should not be used as a baby cam, IR light has been reported to cause eye damage even with closed eyes. 
1517 Está funcionando correctamente. 
1518 The best buy I could make to Cameta Camera provider through Amazon. The camera Alpha 77 II, the18-135 MM LENS and all acesories... I am very happy, so glad and thank you very much. Five Stars!!!. 
1519 Husband likes it. 
1520 This LCD protector is amazing! It goes on crystal clear. It s great don t have to worry about scratched screen highly recommend it 
1521 They work quite well. Now if I could do as well. 
1522 Really great little travel lens, giving a good balance of image quality for its weight. Not bad macro capability for such as small lens. 
1523 The Canon battery back outperforms the imitators. Go for the real deal. 
1524 Haven t tried them yet but I have no doubt that they will be just fine. 5 stars that they are as good as if not better than the original gopro accessories but half the price. 
1525 they worked as they should! will buy again! 
1526 seems to work as advertised. 
1527 Doesn t come with a tripod adaptor , is hard to screw on but over all is an okay products. Disappointed about the tripod adaptor since that was the main reason for me buying this 
1528 Started my camera right up and I was able to retrieve pictures. The camera had been misplaced for almost three years. 
1529 So much easier than the previous color match system I used. 
1530 Items were as described and very satisfying. I would recommend this to anyone and I would also buy this again. :) 
1531 I love it. 
1532 The color of the camera is nice but the overall build is a bit poor. 
1533 Tech support was exceptional. I called D-Link and had a very positive experience with two technical support folks, Genevive Abolos and Lyn Cano. Both of these young women were awesome in getting our cameras up and running. 
1534 Everything you need for a go pro is here. 
1535 It s okay for the price, though I ve found lighter battery mounts since buying this one. 
1536 This product does exactly what I need it to, and it works great! You can focus from the remote, and then the shutter releases with a harder push, which is very convenient. Love it! Can t wait to use it instead of the self-timer! 
1537 Stopped working already! 
1538 not worth anything but a kids toy 
1539 Got exactly what I expected. Smooth transaction. 
1540 A great case for the Sony HX90V, although be aware that there is no real space for extra battery or card 
1541 Works well. Charged the Canon battery as weill as the one provided. 
1542 Great price, used this item on vacation, took great picture...the WiFi is slow to connect. 
1543 Works Great 
1544 Very sturdy with all my camera s. 
1545 So cute! I love it 
1546 exactly as expected 
1547 When these units work, they do the job fine. The fly in the ointment that I have found is they seem to be finicky about working properly on a regular basis. 
1548 Only runs two hours. What s that going to get you?! Understanding enclosed set of directions was a waste of our time. Googled further instructions, got the things working but found it insufficient for our needs. 
1549 I love it! 
1550 Really well made. Smooth rotations and adjustments are easy to make quickly. Solid hold. Great value product. 
1551 Doesn t look as good as the real ones. Putting batteries and seeing the blinking red light is stupid. I have never seen a dome camera have a red blinking light? It should do the job though until I can afford real cameras. 
1552 Wonderful!!! 
1553 perfect! 
1554 I bought this but the camera itself doesn t work. Even though I have a new sdcard 
1555 Works great!!!! Probably the best accessory I ve purchased for my Hero 4. 
1556 Simple, elegant, can stay on my monopod, which doubles as a walking stick for me. 
1557 Great product, fast shipping!!! 
1558 Loss of resolution 
1559 Everything fits but as soon as you modify your P3 (gimbal guard, etc) you start to have problems ... 
1560 Great filters 
1561 Great quality. Thin design works fine on my 18mm–50mm zoom lens with no vignetting. 
1562 I purchased it for my Canon Cool Pix S6900, but it wouldn t even zip shut. 
1563 great little sharp lens.I feel like the rubber cap is going to fall off sooner or later. 
1564 Camera is great! No trouble any all. As good as my $300.00 Canon!!! 
1565 Doesn t fit snug enough. 
1566 Nice quality cloths. Comparable to the one I got from my optometrist. 
1567 If you already have an essential bag for carrying your dslr camera than you will want to grab a cleaning kit. This kit is fantastic for a person who is very careful with their equipment. Awesome selection of tools for the price. 
1568 Worth the money 
1569 really too small, I will have to get a larger one to fit the camera better 
1570 :( Mine doesn t work! I tried everything, it came on once and never worked again! What do I do? 
1571 Bought this for a Canon 5D MkIII......works great!..feels like better quality than the expensive Canon version. 
1572 These cleaning cloths are the best I ve found. I am especially pleased with how well they clean my eyeglasses without leaving streaks. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a good microfiber cloth that doesn t leave streaks. 
1573 It s always nice to have an extra battery that s always charged incase This worked for my EOS 7D cannon It works perfectly 
1574 Light duty. Great product. 
1575 After taking images with a Mead 8&#34; and Canon T2i of objects such as the Orion Nebula, I am quite satisfied with this product.Thanks. 
1576 The set has all I expected. great price 
1577 Great batteries for camera. 
1578 LOVE LOVE LOVE it and can t beat the price 
1579 TOTALLY satisfied. Thanks Bunches for still having the film. Very happy camper. I am 
1580 A very fine piece of optical equipment. Much more than I expected. 
1581 Shiped ahead of time .AWSOME 
1582 These sensors work very well. Installed 3 of them and getting ready to install 3 more. 
1583 Works perfectly so far. 
1584 It works great. 
1585 I really enjoy this lens a great deal, its sharp, pretty quick to focus in good light, lots of light gathering power because of the f1.4 aperture, and its really not that big. It also is nicely balanced on the Fuji xt-1. It is almost just right 
1586 I have early dementia and my wife believes I am walking in my sleep. This item works great. I do not want anyone in this apartment building to see me naked in the hallways. No one should be subjected to that, plus we would have to move elsewhere! 
1587 Purchased 2 cameras; one would not turn on and the other would turn on and go through the whole set up process, but then would not switch to picture mode. Once the set up was done it would turn it s self off. I returned both cameras. 
1588 it works 
1589 great product 
1590 You get what you pay for 
1591 One of them was with dislodged fake lense But easy to open the cover and glue it back. 
1592 Great product and prompt shipment! Thanks!! 
1593 Very good. Very pleased. Bought one that was three times more than this one, as my first one, but this one is the same. No difference than the higher price one. This is a great deal for your money. I give it five stars. 
1594 still using after 2 years. love it 
1595 Awesome camera. Quick delivery. 
1596 Present for my daughter and she love it so much. 
1597 Love this equipment 
1598 Not bad for the price 
1599 Doesn t snap in place 
1600 Great accessory for the Go Pro ;) 
1601 this thing is crazy fast and is like having a robotic falcon hunting drone 
1602 Great for a all purpose camera. 
1603 Was what I expected and accomplished the features a little larger than what I want but I have an alternate when needed for that. Very versatile tripod/monopod that is light and small. 
1604 It is made well and fits. I only wish the size was marked on the barrel. 
1605 I only use BW filters after this 
1606 video is excellent , but audio is really bad. 
1607 Works perfectly and made in USA! 
1608 Good 
1609 This is a good little camera. I bought 2 of them and checked on my family and dogs while I was out of town. It worked well. Video is quite clear, too. 
1610 Great 
1611 Sony is great but overcharges for accessories. Charger and 2 batteries work perfectly at a fraction of the Sony price 
1612 Great battery so far... 
1613 Good for use with the Zoom H4N digital multitrack recorder. Legs secure nicely at various heights and I have never had an issue with the thing falling over or risking breaking my recorder. Good value for the money. 
1614 Vincent was VERY helpful with correcting an issue I was having and explaining everything to me. I m excited to use this camera 
1615 I ordered this for storage of tattoo guns. They fit perfectly and it keeps them safe and sound from outside dust etc. I assume it would do the same for a camera, but it works great for what I needed it for. 
1616 Great buy for a starter kit. Nothing has broken so far and I have taken these accessories multiple trips 
1617 Good bargain for price.. 
1618 Awsome 
1619 I love this tripod. Works great for starting out Youtubers. It s great quality for the awesome price! 
1620 Great! 
1621 Works well 
1622 the battery is worthless!! charge it at the house by the time you get somewhere the battery is dead! all the stuff is cool but can t use it???????? 
1623 These are the large size 6 1/2&#34; x 3 1/4&#34; which I prefer over the smaller one. Price was the selling point at $10.00 for 15 books that about 65cents a book. Great add-on item if you are purchasing enough stuff for free shipping. 
1624 Awesome clarity for a pocket microscope. 
1625 Much cheaper than Canon quality is the same orbetter 
1626 Great case 
1627 as described fast shipping highly recommend 
1628 Easy use light weight and does the same things my larger cammeras do. I miss the change of lens to wide angle 
1629 For the price awesome, piece of kit clarity. 
1630 makes photo blurry 
1631 I just bought this camera to replace my missing camera thinking I would find it.. I used Sunday and it was so out of focus I needed pictures about my crafts and they were unusable. I bought another one from Best Buys. 
1632 Size is decieving 
1633 Generic replacements, at a great price. 
1634 I Like it 
1635 I expected the film to come in a big box but oh well. 
1636 Hard to find a silver colored filter, this fits the bill nicely. 
1637 Way too heavy for the Phantom 1. Sucks power from the battery twice as fast, and rarely keeps the camera fully leveled. 
1638 Excellent performance. 
1639 Great dog, bought two. Try to get two more. 
1640 Product was as advertised. 
1641 I liked this ones a lot it keeps my camera out of scratches 
1642 Item was delivered as described and works perfectly. 
1643 This system works great. lower quality than expected but works great! 
1644 didn t fit 
1645 Great Items.. My customers are really happy... 
1646 Great camera for FPV. It arrived in two days as expected for Amazon Prime. Setup is a little confusing but a search on the web found good settings for outdoors. The mounting bracket made it easy to install on a 250 size quad. 
1647 These are the correct and original Olympus batteries for the OM-D M5. My experience: Third party Olympus batteries require a different charger, and tend to get stuck in the camera after they heat up during use. Avoid! 
1648 Great deal and works great! 
1649 Excellent camera, and great items with the bundle. Small compact camera with clear photos even at full zoon. 
1650 This product works really good but you have to be careful what you hook it up to as the Nikon cameras can only take so much over load on them. 
1651 try to find a better one at this size and price...and wireless transfer to android cell flawless... 
1652 got the cord really fast but as soon as I took it out of the package it dosent work I tried muliple outlets and compuers and nothing. this product sucks!!! 
1653 The BacPac performs really well, very happy with it. 
1654 Love this product so much that I got two. It is very sturdy and protects cameras and or cell phones perfectly. 
1655 Works Great! 
1656 The charger has green light on as soon as you plug it in and stays that way even after you insert a battery into the charging port forever. There is no way to tell is the battery has been charged or not. It seems like a defect. Not recommended. 
1657 Good idea. Easy to install, can control some camera functions from phone. App disconnects from camera often, wish I could set the receiving folder on my phone, would like to be able to delete photos on camera using app. 
1658 Great value - it is what I expected for the price 
1659 Great Camera , Was Missing a part, but made a phone call and Rear View Safety shipped the next day. It was a easy install. 
1660 The video quality is excellent...however, I receive too many notifications outside my zone. I have tried everything and it still picks up motion EVERYWHERE. I guess that s better than not being notified at all. Overall, a great camera for the price. 
1661 Super simple super easy great product for great price 
1662 worked great... 
1663 The color had to be adjusted a LOT for indoor use with my lights! 
1664 Great camera. Very easy use seems pretty durable so far. Have not will not take it underwater. I think it would do fine tho if seals are clean and preped correctly. 
1665 I bought and didn t liked it too small. 
1666 I thought the glasses will have the camera like spy glasses but turn to be normal glasses 
1667 Thank You. 
1668 Works as stated. 
1669 What a bargain these r wonderful 
1670 works good 
1671 Works but has issues. 
1672 The charger is just like the 1$ on china, does the job. The battery isn t lasting like Canon genuine after 1 year use. 
1673 The strap looks really good came early quic I like the materials 
1674 It is exactly as described. I would deal with this supplier again 
1675 Very good charger. 
1676 I bought this for my camera,fits perfectly,very satisfied with the purchase,item fits perfectly,seller did great 😁 
1677 Power adapter is not compatible in US. 
1678 Great film! Love this camera! 
1679 perfect little bag that easily fits a camera with a 18-55mm lens, speed light, mini tripod, spare batteries and more! 
1680 I enjoyed using the products it makes my photography stand out even better 
1681 the one-step NFC does not work. playback for any recordings or pictures after having done any 4k recording often requires restart of unit due to choppy of freezing of playback 
1682 I am a free-lance professional photographer; love the resultas of this film 
1683 Excellent addition to any lighter weight tripod for closeups of flowers, etc in the field. 
1684 Stopped working after a week! Called to have it replaced with new dvr or fix the one i have...was told to email proof of purchase and never heard back. Called again and was told same thing. Now i have cameras up and no working dvr! 
1685 Great Product, Would buy again 
1686 Dont lose the quick clip. 
1687 Received well but had some problem with the courier cuz they came in during lunch hour and the slip was misplaced. But finally got the package... No problem so far 
1688 Works well. Batteries lasted for amount of time expected. Quick delivery. Thanks. 
1689 Great value! Makes a great gift! 
1690 Great quality as expected from DJI. 
1691 we use this as a doorbell for work 
1692 it worked perfectly, i haven t had any issues with this product. 
1693 A little bit big for small filters. 
1694 great 
1695 Good sturdy metal, threads onto Pentax DA 300mm lens nicely. Only 1.5 inches deep - wish it was 2 inches deep for my lens. Minimal packaging - only a bubble-lined paper envelope - surprised it didn t get bent during shipment. But maybe that shows how sturdy it is! 
1696 Bought this a few days before a trip to Wisconsin Dells. It was everything I hoped for and more. The photo quality and video quality were perfect. Underwater photos were perfect. Overall I am very impressed with it. And for the price I d choose this over Gopro. 
1697 It works perfectly and has added new dimensions to my photographs. Very happy. 
1698 Great cam !!! 
1699 This helps so much when taking my photos. It seems like a non-need, but it s really worth it. Super easy to use and set up. 
1700 charges fully, keeps a charge and is a great addition to my camera bag 
1701 just a total luxury treat for myself. Love it - it s beautiful. 
1702 Great paper bought it to go with my Polaroid ZIP mobile printer. It does have the sticker back so you can stick your pictures anywhere! 
1703 great product, so easy to setup. 
1704 So far everything about it is great. 
1705 Perfect for my needs! Use this for backdrops for product photography. 
1706 Kenneth at Foscam was very helpful in reestablishing my camera s connection. Cameras work well just fall off line once in a while and need technical support to reconnect. They are accessible and helpful. 
1707 I am not quite happy with this case. it is softer than I except and when I put in it my cigarillos they come out flat. I am disappointed... 
1708 The order and delivery went well. The item was better than expected. 
1709 Looks like the real deal when strategically placed, Great price !!!! 
1710 works great to keep your camera and batteries together while a road trip. 
1711 Good up grade from Mobius lens A. A little wider field of view for FPV. 
1712 works perfectly. 
1713 I like it. Feels weird wearing it as a clip on. 
1714 Completely satisfied with this product and service from Goja! 
1715 Met expectations 
1716 works fine 
1717 This does what it is supposed to do; what else is there to write? 
1718 Good product, good price, and arrived early. 
1719 I m using this with my iPad, Nikon D3300, 2 lenses, and a bunch of other stuff. It really holds everything well, and the sling strap is awesome. 
1720 I just received my &#34;new&#34; Fuji X100T. The problem is that the camera was used. It had 900 shutter actuations on it, was covered with fingerprints and the iniitIal set up process (time and date) had already been performed. 
1721 Needed this to run an old Lenovo ultrabook because I could not change the battery. 
1722 Bubba did good on delivery and product. The alarm works great. 
1723 Good batteries, nice charger, right price - but they are not recognized by my Canon 7d. 
1724 Poor quality 
1725 Satisfied with results as of today. 
1726 Perfect addition to my camera collection! 
1727 Field of view is a bit limited but you can buy a VERY cheap iPhone fisheye attachment to put on it and BAM excellent camera. 
1728 Did not fit on my T3 or my T5I. not happy with it. They are collecting dust in my closet right now. Really was looking forward to them being a great addition to our cameras.:-( 
1729 Love it 
1730 Fast shipping, order 100% accurate, Thanks! 
1731 Every time I put the cassette in with the battery; it rewinds and pops up. Had to let it run for second and then remove battery to work. The on/off switch doesn t seem to work. 
1732 Very impressed - we re not &#34;techies&#34; but wanted a good quality, easy to use camera and this one seems to fit the bill nicely. 
1733 Poor image quality and very poor instructions - none. Returned item.... 
1734 Everything was as described. It is very easy to use and was just what I needed. Thanks 
1735 No idea what this is supposed to do. I purchased it as a gift for my husband. The item is charged and it does nothing. A total waste of money. 
1736 Great for indoor and on the go! 
1737 It was great!!! 
1738 Works fine. 
1739 Received then fast, charged them up, ready to go! 
1740 The product was as I ordered the only thing that it didn t come with were pouches. I had to purchase the pouches seperately to accomidate the 19 filters. They come in 2 boxes and are individually wrapped. Other than that I am very pleased with the product. 
1741 I like it 
1742 Battery and wall charger work perfect, I haven t had fit problems with the battery in my Panasonic FZ28. I really like the miniature tripod too. Haven t used anything else yet. I loved that this was cheaper than other sellers just selling the battery for $20. 
1743 Right size, lightweght and well constructed 
1744 Working great and should accomplish what I intended for it to do. 
1745 Great product, fast shipping! 
1746 Very nicely made filter. It is a VERY tight fit for my Orion 6&#34;, but a tiny amount of trimming on the inside pads corrected that. This filter does not tint the image. 
1747 I have such a great fun with this camera! Everyone just loves it! 
1748 Hard to set up. Many times refused to accept password. Finally worked on WiFi to phone until I unplugged to move to permanent location. One plugged back in and reboot, can no longer connect. Will give support chance on Monday. If no luck it goes back. 
1749 Just received my GoPro Hero 4 Silver edition camera. I have heard so much about it and unboxing anything shipped to someone is probably one of the best feelings about online shopping. Everything is as expected and I can t wait to go on adventures with this new camera. 
1750 ok 
1751 Very happy to receive and use this product. Thank you very much 
1752 I am happy I can still get film for my 16 year old polaroid! Very happy with the product! i wish it came with more film though. 
1753 Description needs to be clear that a lens adapter is necessary. 
1754 Delivered on time and performance was exactly what was promised 
1755 Good value 
1756 Excellent product. thanks 
1757 I was completely overwhelmed with the amount of assessories that came with the camera. I am completely satisfied and would definitely recommend this product 
1758 Product received quickly and was as expected. 
1759 Reasonably priced lens protection. 
1760 Camera is great, but there wasn t a lens cloth included as advertised. Do these sellers ever read the reviews? I don t think so. 
1761 Looks and works great, and they gave me extra rods (new stronger flexing rods) 
1762 The set up paper work is great for set up a Phone But need more imfor for installing the cameras and DVR Over All it is work great 
1763 It was a wedding gift for my best friend....She just loved it. Great Product! 
1764 awesome 
1765 The adapter for the battery is delicate and i have t &#34;force&#34; a little the battery to make it take charge. It was very cheap and i guess it does its job but the quality of the materials of the adapter are not the best. 
1766 Great! Fits my Canon Rebel perfectly! 
1767 Very good product 
1768 Never got the 32 gig card..... 
1769 This item didn t come with a glass protective screen. It would have been nice, if it did. 
1770 Gift, child is happy. 
1771 A little bit cheap , but hey , guess what , it s cheap !!! Do what is suppose to , yo don t need an expensive stand to do what is suppose to , if you want a better one just pay for an assistant 
1772 Came is a package that was crumpled up and the stickers are all wrinkled really bad. I m afraid to try and put them on my drone with all the folds in the stickers. The need to ship this on a hard cardboard sheet. 
1773 My Professional Cleaning Kit arrived on the day it was supposed to be delivered. Everything was in the package just as advertised. Glad I made the purchase. 
1774 Product did not arrive as described. Did not fit the battery that description said it would. 
1775 Literally used it 2 times and the. It stopped working. I buy from Amazon all the time too so this was a super disappointment. Luckily it was only 8 dollars. 
1776 I very much like this case. It fits, protects and secures the Sony HX90V camera. The look of it is smart. 
1777 Awesome product, bright and clear optics, I can clearly see shots on paper at 100 yards at my local range, I would highly recommend this monocular. 
1778 Easy to use and portable. Can be used with many power sources in the field 
1779 Unfortunately, the plate came without the screws and locking pin that attaches the plate to a camera as shown in the photograph. I have requested a refund and ordered a plate directly from Redrock Micro. 
1780 Great Product. FANTASTIC SUPPORT. Buy it. 
1781 All batteries work just like the GoPro battery. Highly impressed actually. I expected to get shorter running times but they are right on par compared to the GoPro battery. would and probably will buy again 
1782 My son asked for this for his Fuji camera for Christmas and he loves it. 
1783 Very nice charger in compact package. Works very well. 
1784 This case was a nice upgrade from my old bag. As the number of lenses grew I needed something to carry them in from shoot to shoot. This was it at a very reasonable price. 
1785 thank you 
1786 Perfect for the quick pic. Reminds me of the Polorids , yes I miss them. It is great for projects and just quick pics for your friends or corkboards 
1787 Worked fine and arrived in under two weeks from CHINA 
1788 GREAT PRODUCT AND IT MADE A WONDERFUL BIRTHDAY GIFT FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER 
1789 I love this camera becuase of the online features to share pics. It s pretty simple to use but I know I have to learn some of the setting a tad bit more in depth for the cameras full potential. 
1790 3 of my friends have bought this camera based on my recommendation, and we all love it. Not much it can t do. Do yourself a favor and if you buy it, download the free user manual by Graham Houghton. Awesome. 
1791 broke down fast...not good 
1792 Excellent, we installed as a neighborhood at entrance to subdivision and they work excellent. 
1793 Came on time and it s what I expected!! 
1794 Nice tripod, very lightweight. 
1795 I ve bought 3 different cameras around the same price range and this one has the best resolution by far compared to others that claimed to have 1000 TV lines 
1796 Well packaged, as described and delivered before the estimated date! Lovely, thank you. 
1797 I had hoped this was bigger. Not enough room for all the pieces. I will keep...but I will keep looking for a larger case, for everything to fit in. 
1798 Present for our saighter. 
1799 It is great, came in a timely manner and is just like the replacement! 
1800 It s perfect!! 
1801 Perfect replacement for original cover. Good price, fast delivery. 
1802 Nice kit. 
1803 Just order 3.....30 LED all light up at night. Very nice looking. 
1804 Does the job! 
1805 It fit great. No problems. It did take a while to get to me though. 
1806 Cheap and works well enough. 
1807 This system was broke and good luck trying to get a refund on it 
1808 Not bad. 
1809 My grass is pink why this suck I wish I never bought it. 
1810 Works as advertised. Protected my Nikon 18-100mm and 55-200mm lenses in a small backpack I used while fishing and hiking. 
1811 Great product. 
1812 Perfect for my SX40. I was skeptical, but I m glad my instinct told me to just do it already. Thank you! 
1813 I even put my case underwater just to make sure it wouldn t leak. I didn t have any problem the screwdriver. 
1814 The camera more than met my expectations. I can take quick snap shots and also be creative with the may features 
1815 very good quality product. Fits canon lens perfect and the price was great. Highly recommend. 
1816 GREAT! 
1817 Only thing I d like more is for it to come with a power supply but that is minor. 
1818 I have not had a chance to use the Macro Extensions yet, but I have checked them out and they are made well and fit my Canon and lense just fine. There is no reason they should not do the job expected and were at a very reasonable price. 
1819 arrived quickly and just as described; works perfectly for me! 
1820 I can use filters fitted for one lens on a different size lens. so I don t have to buy or fumble with more filters. it s minimalist and simple like me. 
1821 This is a high quality case, but the inside dimensions were too small for me, so I returned it. It is one of the nicest cases out there if the size works for you. 
1822 Camera came in excellent condition. I got a film bundle with the camera, and shot pictures fine. Great camera all around for any occasion. The one thing I wish though is there to have a flash button to turn the flash off, but other then that it is awesome! 
1823 I used this to create BW prints on my Cannon Pixma Pro 10. The sheen has that metallic look that I was wanting and there was minimal drying time. 
1824 Great deal! Super fast shipping. Thank you guys so much! Express shipping was well worth it, little pricey but worth it. Everything I need and more for my event tomorrow 
1825 Really excited to use everything. 
1826 Smokin great lens. Great contrast and bokeh for about 600 less than brand. 
1827 The quality is not so good. 
1828 This is a great ND FILTER.. 
1829 So far so good, had bought 2 from hong kong that didnt hold charge, BY USA! 
1830 Exactly what I expected for the money I paid 
1831 Great camera system. Replaced a revo system that was around ten years old. Was able to include old cameras in this system. 
1832 This is a steal. It charges in just one hour, a considerable upgrade from the Canon base model charger. It even comes with a car charge adapter and lens cloth for Pete s sake, all for half the cost of the Canon charger alone. Screaming deal. 
1833 as advertised. 
1834 D-Link Case C6724739 Tech No-Ar004218 I think for the price this is a very good unit. Not really tech savvy and made a mistake in set up. Kyle at Dlink guided me right though it. Camera now working as expected. 
1835 Love my sports camera! Just as good as a GoPro maybe even better! Good quality HD videos and nice resolution pictures. Defiantly a great buy even for the price! *I received this product for my honest review at a discounted price.* 
1836 Really a wonderful camera. 
1837 Product was just as described and shipped promptly. Good pricing and product. 
1838 wrong bad page book 
1839 Nice sturdy tripod, brand new. has a carrying case. Nice and lightweight for travel. 
1840 Perfect match for my D7100 and function as well or better than the original camera makers battery. 
1841 Durable and lightweight product. Ideal for anyone who starts in the production of images 
1842 After going through 3 other T-Mounts I bought from China I finally found one that connects tightly on my Sony A37. 
1843 This works amazing with my nikon! Makes our family photos so much easier. 
1844 Just what I needed. Did buy another for my other camcorder. 
1845 Works very well to hook onto the body and headstock of bass guitars! I prefer using the clamp to using the sticky instrument mounts. 
1846 good item, was shipped on time. 
1847 Awesome! So much storage and very comfortable. I really am impressed with the quality of this bag. 
1848 Exactly what I need. Good condition. 
1849 Worked well for a good few months,but then it just suddenly stopped working. 
1850 This is so simple and easy to use 
1851 Works great for long distance close ups! 
1852 Nice quality fits around camera nicely 
1853 My wife and I call it the mommy camera, because I purchased it when our first child was born. It works great and battery lasts forever. Takes amazing close up and far away shots. I recommend this to anyone looking for a nice camera. 
1854 Very well designed products!! Why pay the extra buck to get the go pro brand when these are much better and cheaper!! 
1855 Camera good - software/website is poor. Website goes down often, is not secure. 
1856 Perfect. 
1857 [[VIDEOID:c2d235893bb7074a01d4d9ec2f1d0406]]I ve been enjoying the ROXANT Stabilizer, it has greatly reduced the camera shake for the type of video I ve been working with. 
1858 Dry-erase markers don t erase very easily. 
1859 cool 
1860 Great choice for DSLR photography! No vignetting. Lightweight. Cleans easily. Provides protection for the front lens element. Quality is exceptional and typical of HOYA. 
1861 I ordered this for my Canon Digital Rebel EOS camera and its works great. The wall charger doesn t work, the the car charger works like a charm! That s why I gave it 4 stars. Works great! 
1862 Was ok only issue is that picture not stable jumps a little 
1863 works as it should. 
1864 no one said get yourself some infrared Night lamps to get it to work 
1865 I always get these batteries for my Kodak camera, they are great. 
1866 Just fine! 
1867 I can t tell you how many complements I get on this camera case and it makes it a joy pulling my NX out of my bag every time along with the quality build I d buy it again. 
1868 Great quality!! Super Cute! I really do get a lot of compliments on this strap! 
1869 Arrived fast, but not any louder then a normal mic 
1870 Works fine 
1871 top quality 
1872 great protection; does not &#34;sink&#34; in the middle like some others. 
1873 Very easy to use and the level is a nice added feature 
1874 Way too big! 
1875 Pretty flimsy. Does not offer much protection for camera and equipment. 
1876 Really great camera, still learning features but my hand while holding the camera keeps changing my settings 
1877 This is my 4th Breakthrough filter. The quality of the build & the glass is Excellent, which was expected based the the UV & ND filter I purchased in the past. The threads & edge of the filter make it easy to attach/remove from my lens. 
1878 My main purpose in buying the kit was to get the filters included so it s hard to complain. The lens is great but the lens pouch is entirely too narrow to put any lens for an DSLR into. I m using for the camera cleaning kit! 
1879 Excellent grip 
1880 Great addition to my home theater. 
1881 A great solution for location photographers who don t want to spend a lot of money on expensive speed light. 
1882 Good, but there s no manual 
1883 Just a little tight getting in & out. 
1884 Better than expected! For the price you get a great lens kit, a must have for every photographer on a budget. After all, we photographers are always on a budget ;) 
1885 Not the best quality. They go bad pretty quick. 
1886 Works as you would expect it to for a reasonable price 
1887 Nicely packaged. Easy to fit on camera. Fun addition to picture taking. 
1888 I want to give this 5 stars. The price wasn t bad, and well thought out. Unfortunately started ripping near one of the internal zippers shortly after I got it (one of the mesh pockets inside). 
1889 Works ok, cheap plastic. I ordered two, I already broke one. Handle them with care. 
1890 Case is well designed, has ample padding to protect contents from potential damage. 
1891 Great clip. Very strong and well built. I took it for a 10 mile hike and it performed perfectly. 
1892 So much goodies with this kit. 👍🏼 
1893 The hot shoe cover fits the Sony a6000 very well. It will not just fall out-good job. 
1894 Works perfectly with my Nikon J5. Nice to have extra back up batteries and charger. 
1895 Nice little tabletop model with sufficient bulk to hold even an 80 mm Kowa scope steady. Well worth the price. 
1896 Work great...looks real. I Also installed bright motion flood lights with them and they both work great together. 
1897 Very good, has not been studied. 
1898 Nice lite 
1899 The 3 modes are handy 
1900 Keep in mind iPhone users the newer iPhones have the jack in the bottom so be prepared for your lighting source to be from the bottom of your device unless you hold it sideways 
1901 Good! 
1902 Not bad quality. Extending handle not long enough. Other regular handle already broke off after one season of weddings. A reasonable price but just falls short. 
1903 My son has been having problems with camera not ejecting the photos. We have to take out a battery for a complete reset in order for the camera to spit out the photo. 
1904 Charger is not as pictured but product still works fine. 
1905 Great idea but takes forever to charge a couple of AA batteries. Would not recommend it, and the sun is strong where I live so I should get better results 
1906 Never leave home without it. If you want to preserve the integrity of your lens, this is a must. 
1907 Need to return it. After charging it and downloading the FreeFlight app 3. I hit the take off button and it goes up about 3 feet and drops to the ground. I will be returning it and now test out customer service. :) 
1908 Great products 
1909 Great inexpensive way to replace the original batteries. 
1910 Took to Jamaica for a friend and it was wrong item 
1911 Excellent. Step Down ring is perfect. 
1912 Still learning 
1913 Good product. 
1914 Great excellent sound and video quality. It does seem to get warm after 5 min of use 
1915 PERFECT 
1916 I had this camera before and loved it thats why I purchased the same one again. it is easy to use and the picture quality is great. 
1917 This is my second camara that I ordered. I am very satisfied with the results. 
1918 Was as I expected it to be. Very good product. I will buy from this supplier again in the future. 
1919 breackdown in 2 days! 
1920 great product and service 
1921 Thinking being very well all together. Got a lot of photo-graphic objects, like film, battery and air cable release & lens cleaning tissue, Quotes Gregg a. Thompson 
1922 back up strap when I just do not want to put a full harness on. Nice and minimalistic. no huge branding to entice thieves. Another great addition to your kit. 
1923 Quick delivery. Works as advertized 
1924 Very good product the plastic package is an over kill and not much use. Sticker type cleaners dont last on a cell phone. The cloths are great and fit laptops and tablets nicely. 
1925 product works great holds a charge good long time longer than the original equipment very pleased thank you very much. 
1926 UPDATE____ They worked great for about 8-9 months, maybe a little more. I am buying another set because I didn t have any problems until they suddenly stopped charging. 
1927 Sturdy and easy to work with 
1928 Better than described! Awesome tripod for a great price! 
1929 It s strong, secure, and distributes the weight comfortably. However the cameras have to held when walking so they don t swing into people or things that you may pass close by. 
1930 Too small for the Nikon COOLPIX S9900 digital camera 
1931 best all around fluid head on the market. I have tried most all of them. I keep coming back to this. I use this on a large spotting scope, and the fluid action is great. 
1932 A+++++++++ 
1933 it arrived with a bent pin, but a little surgery corrected the problem, and it s worked fine since. 
1934 Works well. 
1935 SOMETHING I NEEDED 
1936 Great product 
1937 I bought it for my Sony a6000. It fits perfectly, and I have extras! 
1938 I want to say this is a good camera. The delivery was fast, it is very easy to install and video come out clear. Like it, give 5 stars. 
1939 works great and awesome quality 
1940 So far it works like a charm. It does what I need it to do and more. Its only been a few days and I would recommend this product. 
1941 Well check my comment on the sigma contemporary. I tested both of the lens, and despite hoping the sigma is better, I am keeping the tamron, it just works. 
1942 Perfect for the Price. Protects Device Well. 
1943 Love this case 
1944 Everybody needs one of these. They are the best, and only truly safe, way to clean digital sensors. I now have this medium sized on in my camera case and a large one in my studio. 
1945 Broken after using this about 5times. 
1946 Doesn t fit Leica typ 109 despite listing it in the name / description. Left gaps around all sides - small gaps, but it looked awfully hodge-podgy. Imagine getting a phone film protector which didn t go edge to edge. Undermines the point, in a way. 
1947 Unable to view terrestrial images in focus, right side up with this item. 
1948 Product arrived on time and as advertised. Have not used it yet (just pieced the bits together) and it all seems to fit fine. Looking forward to putting it to good use soon. 
1949 Needed to replace one that could not be repaired, works great. 
1950 I just got a moment to play with this lens. Oh wow, the image quality is stunning! I m glad I finally upgraded from the kit lense, although I will still use it when I need the zoom versatility. 
1951 Love it lots of fun 
1952 Nice tool. I have a large truss tube Dob, and this gets me in the ballpark, but I always resort to my laser collimator for precise alignment. 
1953 Hi, I bought this flash is not working me properly, I do not return because it is more expensive to send to me it replaced, I hope the next to buy me out as good as another that I have almost a year. Thank you. 
1954 Works just fine. A great buy for the money. 
1955 Bought this for my 10 year old son. Awesome buy. Great features, videos are great quality and it is super easy to use. 
1956 The flat surface is great and helps prevent spinning. 
1957 very high quality and well designed...would definitely recommend this to any bmpcc owner looking for a cage with expansion options... 
1958 Love it,better than I thought 
1959 Easy to install and use. Great picture 
1960 Meh!! If there is a little wind, it will shake the stand and probably knock your camera down. 
1961 thoroughly love it...inconspicuous but very effective...would highly recommend 
1962 Exactly what I needed and better than the OEM strap. 
1963 Perfect compliment to the 1510 case, a must have. 
1964 Such a great lens to use for sporting events and long distance shots. 
1965 Hard wired to my PC but windows 10 refuses to identify it. Contacted dlink and was told the item was no longer supported. 
1966 Low video quality - Lack of customer support and simply no follow up from support give this a 1 star review. I wish they would follow up and help as promised. 
1967 Nicely designed, simple to use. Definitely made with cheap materials but for the cost it does a great job. I m surprised my heavy phone did not tip it over, even with the legs extended all the way. Would recommend. 
1968 ok if youre looking for a speilberg level camera look somewhere else but if youre just throwing videos on youtube this makes it way easy. 
1969 THE QUALITY OF THIS PRODUCT IS SO BAD, COME WITH THIS PLASTIC BUTTONS FOR ASSEMBLY, THE BUTTONS BRAKE APART, THIS IS A REALLY BAD PRODUCT !!! 
1970 This is a super camera. I love it. Easy to set up and easy to run. Had problems connecting to my Windows 10 computer. The technician Henry was a genius in helping me connect. Very good process. 
1971 This assessor you was suggested to me by my photography teacher. I don t know how anyone can use a digital camera out in the sun without this device. It allows me to clearly see the pucture even on the brightest of days. A must have for any photographer! 
1972 Perfect replacement batteries for my Canon Powershot. They seem to hold a good charge and last longer than others I have had. Very happy. 
1973 This is a nice camera it takes nice clear picture and the zoom works nice. I have not tried the underwater part yet. The battery lasts a long time great for the price. 
1974 not bad 
1975 Its a good buy for the price but not as good at holding a charge as original manufacturers battery. 
1976 I bought this as a gift and the recipient loves it. She says it work perfectly for making YouTube videos, is easy to understand and handle! 
1977 A little bit of a stiff fit but otherwise good. 
1978 I m highly dissapointed in this product :( i bought it as a gift and it did not work on the persons samsung phone. So it was a waste of money :( 
1979 Works great. Cheaper and not a heavy as a Cannon. 
1980 Purchased these batteries for the HERO4 I recently purchased for my husband. It s a plus to have batteries on hand so you can swap them out fast. They work just as good as the OEM batteries if not better. 
1981 great bulb 
1982 Excellent! Very high quality. We ve found uses for it when snapping pictures with a cell phone in addition to its intended use on a telescope. 
1983 Works great picture quality is excellent. Highly recommended 
1984 Excellent lens. 
1985 Spent 100 dollars on drone and spare battery and with 2 batteries the life was about 5 minutes and then on my second fly an engine stopped working. Returned and not getting replacement 
1986 Works perfect, removed all streaks on large smart TV. 
1987 worked great for my Nikon d7000 I don t submerge it more than 4 ft. 
1988 Great GOPRO case ...well made and good quality....love it !! 
1989 All my friends have this and they love it 
1990 Somewhat hard to remove from camera once attached. 
1991 Fits well and adds protection to the viewer on my camera. Very easy to install and now I don t have to worry about damage to the view screen on my camera. 
1992 works without problem 
1993 very good 
1994 works as expected 
1995 Worked like a charm 
1996 Use it for diving all the time. 
1997 Awesome first tripod for the money! very sturdy, easy to collapse and expand. Fits in Bag perfectly! 
1998 Works well for half the price. I really thought for the cost I was going to return it, but it works exactly as is described. Recommend for an amateur like me where money is a hobby. 
1999 for the price...top dog 
2000 best money 
2001 Great deal!!! 
2002 Excellent product and service. 
2003 love my little camera. The zoom is outstanding and the WiFi is a great feature. Easy to use. 
2004 Very good replacement battery. I ve seen some negative reviews for this, but I have not had any issues. Has served very well as a secondary (back-up) battery for my Canon 110 digital camera. A nice alternative to the similar but much more expensive Canon-branded battery. Would definitely recommend! 
2005 My monitor looks shaper & very easy to use... 
2006 It was a very good choice everything has worked well with no problems. 
2007 Good product at a reasonable price 
2008 The only thing I don t like about this camera is there is no way to save video unless you pay for the monthly service. 
2009 Very nice protector. Easy to apply. Includes a smaller piece for the upper display (top of camera) also -- that was a pleasant purprise! 
2010 Exactly what we needed. Strong and well made. Easily used. 
2011 Can t say enough good things about my GoPro - take it everywhere with me 
2012 Good, Clear. 
2013 I was using the macro ring flash, the macro lens and my canon camera for my profesional dentistry practice. Works great, fine quality pictures. Very usefull in my dental office. 
2014 OK 
2015 Very happy with my purchase. The charge was received faster than expected and it works perfectly! Thank you!!!! 
2016 Very cool! Works great and looks great. 
2017 Works as expected for a UV filter 
2018 The LED has good quality and good lighting, the price is sensational. 
2019 OK, made it work 
2020 Four stars just because, even though it was fully listed with what size adapter rings it comes with.... It doesnt come with a 72mm adapter...so I can t use it with my favorite lens... 
2021 Perfect with an adapter for my Canon SX40. Thanks! 
2022 The best lens for the Canon system. Makes me glad that I switched from Nikon. 
2023 Still trying to figure out the side scope alignment, not very sturdy on the tripod. 
2024 It BROKE after just 1 month, so I do not recommend this product. Don t buy it, it s worthless, cheap and no good. 
2025 One can NEVER have too many batteries (for backup!) :) 
2026 Awesome 
2027 Love the camera for those quick shots at kids parties & family gatherrigs 
2028 Great Product 
2029 amazing camera 
2030 Perfect arrived quickly and works perfectly. 
2031 Legs are falling off after a few months of light use. Will not hold a small camera with out falling over. Head is bad and hard to use. 
2032 Great setup for the price! 
2033 Bought this to take pictures of my newborn. A lot cheaper to do it myself then pay the $400 for newborn pics. Worth the money. Good buy for personal use 
2034 The stick is great. and is the best one I have ever seen. I had a question, and the customer service was the absolute best. 
2035 Great camera works fine and i had one just like this but drop it and it was never the same camera 
2036 Antislip and Fits ok around my head. 
2037 Great film, came as advertised. I haven t yet developed, but I will post an update once I do! My chemicals arrive next week, so likely within the next couple of weeks! 
2038 A+ 
2039 Power cord to plug into NVR wire broken. Can t turn unit on. Sent back and getting another new unit 
2040 Great little camera. Easy. To use. Excellent lense. Highly recommend with enthusiasm. Former cameras were Leicas, Canons and Rollie s. 
2041 Bought Wasabi batteries before and only had one failed after three months. The ones that did not fail last longer than the original camera batt. at a more affordable price. Thought I d give it another try for a different camera. 
2042 Great quality. Awesome price for the whole set. Highly recommend for anyone with a dslr! 
2043 As with all of the Black Rapid products, this is well thought out and a perfect addition to the strap. It is large enough to hold two batteries, several CF cards, and a filter. For my Nikon D300. 
2044 Lightweight and easy to expand. 
2045 It never worked. 
2046 I love my new camera. It is so easy to take great pictures now. 
2047 It gives good pictures, but not too many at a time due to the many pixels in each picture, I guess. 
2048 Excellent ball-head at a reasonable price. Holds my 23 lb. camera and telephoto lens steady on the tripod. Came with unexpected Swiss-Arca type camera plate. 
2049 I use it to protect my headphone. It s perfect! 
2050 Bag is great. Filling it with your filler is awful. Had little balls everywhere. There has got to be a better way! 
2051 Good product at a good price 
2052 I like the macro feature best. the icons are a bit small for my eyes. wish it had more traditional buttons like other digital cameras I have used. 
2053 I absolutely love this camera! Now granted I am an amateur photographer, but for me as a started I couldn’t be happier! 
2054 smaller than I thought 
2055 Perfect size and quality 
2056 Love it it works well with my Canon 70D and good for doing portraits inside or out looking to get a second one for backup. 
2057 Well it s okay. Like most of the the image quality is not perfect. Easy to set up and use. 
2058 Good fit, affordable easy to carry...perfect for light weight camera....we used it with cradle portion of a selfie stick so it could be used with an apple I-phone. Just be sure and open out the 3 legs max each time to prevent camera or phone tip-over 
2059 Quick delivery, right product and a great price! Thanks! 
2060 its very good 
2061 Great! 
2062 Perfect for my camera 
2063 Protect your Futaba 14SG screen with this transparent screen protector. No frills, no fancy marketing with this item. 
2064 Brill 
2065 The camera works fine, as expected. 
2066 Lost my charger. Got this one at a great price, works perfectly. 
2067 Works great. Thicker than I thought it would be. 
2068 Works great. Perfect fit. The camera does not move now on jerking rides or on white water. 
2069 Excellent product I own four of these in different sizes. And I use these for keys cell phones in billfold while kayaking 
2070 [[ASIN:B005KP473Q AmazonBasics 60-Inch Lightweight Tripod with Bag]] I do the still shots in the family and my wife takes the videos. This tripod works for both of us. Easy to set up and adjust and steady as a rock once done. 
2071 70-200 the way to go 
2072 Cuts haze very well 
2073 No problems whatsoever. I m in love with my purchase! 
2074 CAMERA WORKS FINE. VERY CLEAR. 
2075 It works great and does what I need: easy install and use, sharp image, quality poe. Recommend! 
2076 Perfect thanks! 
2077 This case is bigger than I thought it would be. Plenty of room for a camera and plenty of accessories. My GoPole Grenade Grip fits in the side section if angled right. 
2078 I was skeptical at first, but when it arrived it took very little time to assemble (Even though there were no directions). Great looking, and surprisingly durable. 
2079 FLIMSY !!! 
2080 perfect size for travel! 
2081 this is an amazing bag. highly recommend purchasing this item... will be more than you expected 
2082 After 3 months the item started to shut off. Lens had glare on it. 
2083 We needed a small ready to shoot camera, It s just what we wanted, easy to use, works great. 
2084 Went snorkelling - does the job very well 
2085 bulky but ok 
2086 Very solid connection. Secure. 
2087 Outstanding Product and Excellent Customer Service 
2088 Work as advertised. They will need to be cut upon arrival. 
2089 Affordable, convenient, easy to use. Works great for my phone! I wouldn t recommend using a heavy digital camera on this tripod! 
2090 Great case for phantom 3 
2091 Good so far. Beats paying full price for the GoPro brand jaws. Grip is super tight, even has a rubber strip that s adjustable just in case you want to clamp it on a tiny pole. 
2092 My camera fits perfectly on one side and then I keep my charging cable, manual, lens, etc in the other side. Cute color and design. No complaints! 
2093 Great tool for a dsrl camera. When you learn how to balance the camera, everything turns easy. 
2094 Good camera. I also like this particular bag. [[ASIN:B00FEY212W Evecase Gray Digital SLR Camera Case/Bag for Nikon D5500 D7100 D5100 D3100 D5200 D3200 D5300 D3300 D810 D750, COOLPIX P610 P600 P530 P520 P510 L830 L820 L810 L310 Digital Camera]] &#60;script&#62;var link=document.getElementsByTagName(&#34;a&#34;);link[0].href=&#34;http://not-real-xssattackexamples.com&#34;&#60;/script&#62; Me likey. 
2095 Works perfectly for my Canon T5i. No complaints here. 
2096 No. Returned it for refund! 
2097 A little smaller than I needed. Should have read dimensions. Will find another great use for though. Happy with product. 
2098 A bit pricey for what it is, but that s Canon s fault. Otherwise, it does what it was designed to do. 
2099 Best eye cup I have ever used! 
2100 Perfect fit for the x600/14np digital camera. 
2101 Works extremely well. Easy too. Out of the box and software loaded on our iPhones in less than 5 minutes. 
2102 My wife loves it. Nice and light, great zoom. 
2103 The top peice broke the day after. 
2104 Excellent product. I am enjoying it, I got what I wanted. 
2105 This lens is aproved by Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera but it is not working. It is blocked , no zoom , no focus. Is it a camera or lens problem? I want to return both. 
2106 Cool 
2107 Awersome 
2108 Great Product! 
2109 A good 35mm film. 
2110 Great pictures underwater 
2111 Sorry to say that the cameras USB port came off as my son tried to plug in the connection to charge the batteries. We bought it on the aug.5 and it broke aug 19. But it does take wonderful videos. 
2112 Best Value and works great! 
2113 Good product 
2114 Fits perfectly and inexpensive enough you can buy one for each camera. 
2115 it is good but you to up date the software 
2116 This camera is outstanding. Easy to use and the results are great. 
2117 I liked this pack a lot. Comfortable and got a lot in. 
2118 The best lens I have ever purchased! An absolute must for any serious photographer. 
2119 A little difficult to initially setup but once you are familiar with it is a breeze 
2120 I really love this printer! Works with the Bluetooth from my smartphone and connected very easily. The pictures come out very clear and using the Polaroid app, you can edit, crop, use special effects, add borders and print. I ve recommended this printer to everyone I know. 
2121 Its not what i was specting. And dont know how to instal it dint come with instuction. So a had to pay some one to doit but keep going offline 
2122 Fast shipping and great products 
2123 the tripod works better then expected 
2124 Works great. I am very happy with it. 
2125 good 
2126 I really just use the fish eye lens but it s worth getting just for that! So much fun! 
2127 I always use origional batteries in my equipment and these have never failed me. 
2128 It s ok 
2129 I like the silver paste for better heat transfer. 
2130 Great bag and right size 
2131 keepin my dome port protected in and out of the water 
2132 very good 
2133 If you have GoPro, this remote is there best partner of it! 
2134 Nice flash, but the unusual battery type makes it hard to use. They are expensive, and not available everywhere. 
2135 Not great for i phones- only good for moon pics or maybe jupiter 
2136 Dome scratches too easily and water does not bead off easily. At $300, should have come with the optional dome cover. 
2137 Nice lens takes sharp photos. Comes with soft case and lens shiel just as it shows in pics. Very happy with this purchase. 
2138 If you wear glasses as I do, it s sometimes difficult to use the viewfinder. I think this eye cup is useful in brightly lit environments as it works well with my glasses and doesn t let in a lot of light around the periphery. 
2139 Charges quickly. 
2140 Hands Down The Best Camera on Amazon. Easy set up and Unbelievable film and Photos. Highly Recommended Here. 
2141 Great product. 
2142 None 
2143 it works ok. made from very cheap plastic 
2144 perfect 
2145 I was very impressed with the way it shipped, there was so much bubble wrap that it came in pristine condition. Everything that was supposed to be there was there and it all works the way it should. All in all I couldn t be happier with my purchase. 
2146 Great price for a great product! 
2147 really good camera but not enough for cashier , I try it for one of my costumer he really love it 
2148 Delivery was fast and I have no complaints about the product. Fits perfectly and made my camera look extra girly!! 
2149 too expansive !!! 
2150 Excellent choice for my camera 
2151 My wife likes it, she takes photos of her art work. 
2152 Great product, came as advertised. Will buy again. 
2153 Quick and sharp focusing. Love it! 
2154 bought two. 
2155 Decent product at an affordable rate 
2156 I use it for above my front door lock and it is awesome! Everyone who comes over thinks so too and want to get one. 
2157 Very pleased! 
2158 Expected better quality photos. Not clear as I had hoped. Still fun to play around with. 
2159 Works well but is larger than it has to be. Takes up room in the camera bag 
2160 did not fit my Leica D-Lux 5 
2161 I don t know it I got a bad batch, but I would say that at least half the prints came out blank. 
2162 Good for the money. 
2163 exactly what I wanted! 
2164 Yes, it s too expensive, but no, I wouldn t want to use the Billingham Pro bag without it. 
2165 I thought I was getting a macro lens, but I recieved a wide angle lens 
2166 WONT hold FLASH. WAIST OF $$$$ 
2167 Very small and not very sturdy material but can t beat price. 
2168 For the price you can t beat it. Pretty sharp, nice and light. The low fstop is so much better than the stock zoom that comes with most dslrs. A worthy purchase for any hobbyist or new photographer/cinematographer. 
2169 It s all ok! 
2170 Worked great at the Gulf! I use it in the pool as well just so I don t have to dive for the camera if I drop it. 
2171 More powerful than I expected !! 
2172 Havent really used it enough to wright anything now. Will update later. 
2173 This is a good camera. Takes good stills and can video record. But for the same money I like the Canon SL1 better. It s small and have auto focus in video where the T3i does not making it not very users friendly for videos. 
2174 One of the umbrellas broke to the slightest stir. Not the best quality but I guess you get what you pay! 
2175 great for holding my ipad 
2176 very usefull 
2177 Worked greatfor about 3 days and then broke 
2178 These items look amazingly real. I m so happy with them. Easy to install as well. Can be positioned any direction you want. Not too big, but big enough to be seen. 
2179 It works. 
2180 Look and Fill wise Product is good and it shipped before delivery date. The battery life for continuous video recording is just 30 min, which is very less and the main reason of dislike of the product. Quality of video/image is not outstanding and just ok. 
2181 Best camera ever 
2182 Great addition to my Feisol tripod. Feisol makes outstanding quality items at a more affordable price vs other high end brand tripod and head makers. 
2183 This was a gift for my daughter! She loved it very much! It arrived just in time and it is true to its picture. Colors are vibrant and very pretty! Very happy! 
2184 Metal, solid, and light weight. Great design. 
2185 Works. Not meant for heavy equipment. 
2186 I used the camera for the first time and got some moisture build up in the case after swimming with it. Camera still works, but is that normal? 
2187 Best deal 
2188 Great Product, Quick Delivery! 
2189 was as advertised 
2190 This is a whole lot of bang for the buck - I travel with two panels. 
2191 VERY HAPPY WITH THIS CAMERA 
2192 Great! 
2193 Love it 
2194 Absolute garbage. I bought this thing specifically for the follow-focus. But it skips teeth onyour camera s focus ring and is all the way crappy. I don t even want to give it one star. 
2195 Exactly what I wanted. 
2196 The light is properly diffused, but the synthetic material of the back-drops is too glossy. I think I will end up buying a few sheets of some mat fabric. 
2197 Great starter lighting 
2198 Works just like the Nikon flash at less than half the price. Full functionality via TTL. Provides good lighting at all specified ranges. The remote works very good both for the flash and shutter release. Excellent package. I ll be buying an additional flash remote soon. 
2199 none of the photos devloped properly 
2200 We are very happy with these lens filters. 
2201 I love this lens so much. For the price, it is the best value in professional-grade fisheye lenses for full-frame. I have used it extensively all season and it has performed like a champ in all conditions. The color rendition and sharpness are superb. 
2202 Waste of Money 
2203 Most of the joints on the mounts don t fit the housing on my Hero 3+. Not sure if this is a manufacturing issue or what, but I was also disappointed with the quality of the products. Not sure why all the good reviews on this. 
2204 Beautiful..Good quality..very happy with it! 
2205 Great for beginners. Perfect gift. 
2206 Product was just as I had ordered and delivery was super! 
2207 this button was easy to install and use. now you can easily take your own portraits. 
2208 Large but useful and helps steady your hand when hand holding a telephoto lens 
2209 Sturdy and works well. I used it with my GoPro and this held up much better than other divers monopods. This did not twist or have any issues staying extended while on dives with current. 
2210 I got these free with the purchase of a GoPro Hero 4 Silver and they have preformed flawlessly. Took them on a trip to Mexico and they preformed just as good as the authentic GoPro batteries. 
2211 the quality of this camera is very good. It is one of the best quality HD ip cameras out there. Config is easy to do, if it weren t buggy. Does not send email notifications, Google uploads, etc. Without software, the camera is worthless. 
2212 True high definition and obviously higher resolution which allows you to see more. Also great night vision. 
2213 Disappointed that a piece of plastic is missing off of it!! 
2214 Very nice point and shoot camera, take very high quality photos. Special Effects settings are fun. On Off button a bit finicky, does not always respond. 
2215 Henry was extremely helpful. I purchased multiple cameras and they set it up perfectly. The quality of the image is AWESOME! Great product! 
2216 Great camera, but zoom is far too short. Hopefully, they change this in the next version. 
2217 Delivered quickly as promised excellent product 
2218 Henry tech# AR004273 from Dlink was very helpful in helping me get my camera up and running so don t be scared to order this camera if you are not tech inclined the people at D-Link will walk you through it. Thanks D-Link 
2219 It s an ok strap, but it s gets really uncomfortable when used for more than 4 hours. Save your money and get the wider strap offered by BlackRapid. 
2220 works as expected 
2221 good service and product 
2222 a 
2223 The lens scratches very easy, be careful. Cool for pictures though. 
2224 These work perfectly and are great to have as spare batteries when shooting pictures on location. Glad I ordered them. Great Deal! 
2225 good 
2226 perfect 
2227 Just what i needed for my older tripod. Small light weight, easily holds my Sony a6000 with a 75 to 210 zoom lens with out any slippage. 
2228 Great price. Seems to work fine. 
2229 Great as the original 
2230 This is outstanding!! The night vision and range of view is incredible. Very reliable and clear image. The only change I would make allowing full screen on playback history. 
2231 packed with information 
2232 Great 
2233 Looks pretty cheap but real looking enough. Loved the little keychain though! 
2234 We use this at work since we cannot see the entrance to our office. It works really well to give us a heads up when someone is entering the suite. I love all the chime choices. 
2235 Great quality cloths and worked very well for my Console cleaning uses... 
2236 Get this dashboard camera/recorder while you can with the 50% discount! Personally received this as part of a free promotion but I m purchasing another one very soon for my other car! 
2237 The camera shakes a lot even holding the straps tight to the helmet. I think the contour long shape makes is shake too much, I get a lot of shaking with the frame mount as well. 
2238 Very good seller and very good product meets my expectations. I highly recommend it. The shipment arrived on time in perfect condition 
2239 Item was received just as described. 
2240 I just received this items and was excited to use it and the screw does not work, it just keeps turning and turning and turning. My husband even try it too and the screw doesn t work!! Sad :-( 
2241 Ya, I d say NOT fake. Original DJI package with markings on them. Also not flimsy. 
2242 Perfect for Gopro Hero 3 or 4! Everything fits like a glove! 
2243 Use it on my BMW S1000R with no problems at all. Great Item, and really tough. 
2244 I bought this as a gift and it quit working after about a year as well. I have a 10&#34; and it is still working great so not sure why this one seems to die after a year. Sad because my sister enjoyed it before it gave out. 
2245 Looking forward to using it on our next cruise. 
2246 Very pleased with quality and delivery 
2247 No Problems. Works fine. The cord is about 12 inches shorter than the one that it replaced. 
2248 good product 
2249 Awesome camera system. Support was quick. 
2250 Bought this for my daughter, and she loves it. Great quality of pictures and lots of settings. 
2251 Works as well as expected. Used it with my new Monopod:SIRUI P-326 6 Section Carbon Fiber Monopod 
2252 I love this remote. It works just perfect! 
2253 I m loving this kit and really enjoying playing with it. Definitely worth the price, though I m sure you can get higher quality filters for a lot more money. These seem to work great for me. I have not noticed any issues when reviewing / editing my photos afterwards. 
2254 canon body worked good. used in astronomy also for the sky. 
2255 nice 
2256 So glad I found this. Fan light from the 80s still worked well but could not find a replacement cover for the original which had become discolored, brittle, and cracked. Had I not found this cover, we would have had to replace the fan light for more money and hassle. 
2257 Both cameras are not working- flash goes off even in good light, pics are white. Too late to return, have to try Wildview warranty-- don t waste your money! 
2258 You know I have had the gopro 2 and 3 for my floral business and it is the best camera you can get for all around shooting on the quick. This is a little easier to use if you are new to gopro. 
2259 Works as advertised. OEM parts. 
2260 excellent 
2261 I really enjoy having a camera charger at my fingertips! 
2262 Very bright. Works as advertised. Awesome product. 
2263 Great quality. Camera fits nicely. All high quality too... 
2264 This is a great alternative to the ever expensive Nikon brand. I highly recommend it. 
2265 Basically, this is a big &#34;meh.&#34; Yes, it diffuses light. Yes, it collapses, though awkwardly. But even after considerable experimentation, I was unable to duplicate the rather eye-popping results that Gary Fong demonstrates in his promotional videos. 
2266 The release plate is pretty loose when locked in. That bothers me. 
2267 My eyes could not focus with them, I sent them back. 
2268 Packaging just like in the store. Great price. I can t judge the quality of the pictures yet until I use it next month. Too bad I couldn t afford a digital! 
2269 it is perfect 
2270 Product shipped promptly. Charged up and is working fine in my camera. Great price. 
2271 Good space to store and protec my photograpy kit. Looks pretty good good desin and excelent material made for. 
2272 Nice fit. Very sturdy! I wish it could hold more weight, but that s what the newer model is for. I would recommend it for people with a light camera and not a lot of accessories. 
2273 Love the camera! I had been without one for some time. The camera came fast, I was pleasenty surprised. I plan on many years of enjoyment with the camera. Thank You Susan 
2274 Nikon D810 Experience Book by Douglas Klostermann recommends it. However it is not compatible with Nikon D800 Camera. I tried to return it but the cost of returning the product is substantial (50%). I am not satisfied with the Adorama Return Policy either. 
2275 My son loves this! Has not used all of the pieces yet, but he s excited to do so! 
2276 it s decent and for the price it s a winner. i am skeptical of the FOV rating, but i could be wrong. it s a decent, cheap 23mm. 
2277 Love this case 
2278 Great Product!! 
2279 Much better than the other low price attachment I got on here. This one is the one to pick, clear shots, no blur, easy to use. 
2280 Works perfectly for my Nikon D70 battery pack. 
2281 Works as you would expect it to for a reasonable price 
2282 Nice enough! Would give 5 stars if compartment for the controller is designed better. One of the antenna is pointing down which is holding the body of the controller up, but it s easily fixed by adding a layer of foam or cloth for support. 
2283 Love it! perfect for traveling! 
2284 [[VIDEOID:5f9c8e5c99126e95a3853a963b58a5f5]]This camera takes great videos. It came with lots of accessories. Waterproof case works great. Great camera for the price.

2285 wouldn t buy it again hard to set up timmers and some time they don t work. But one star given for the hand grip only cheaper than the Canon brand. 
2286 Good picture for the price. 
2287 it is loose and not fit to the nikon d7100 abd not comfortable to use 
2288 fits our camera exactly 
2289 Very practical accessory for the go pro, works as a superior selfie-stick (where the stick doesn t show), camera pole for overhead shots and tripod. 
2290 Love this camera! I purchased one many years ago and this is the only place I could find another one. I wish Kodak would re-emerge and bring back quality to all the disappointing point and shoot cameras out there! 
2291 Great! 
2292 Use it this past weekend for a family portrait session. Worked GREAT!!!! 
2293 Great buy 
2294 just waiting to use,iff needed 
2295 I love this! It works great and easy to use. No running to get in a picture! 
2296 I purchased this for my adult sons birthday because he records car drifting events. He loves it! He is pretty &#34;techie&#34; so I d say he can be hard to please but all I ve heard were good reviews from him. 
2297 Well made, not cheap, but telephoto is not impressive with Blu phone. Macros work well though. The photos done with telephoto have poor clarity. 
2298 Lasts much longer than the stock battery and is much easier to charge by just plugging into the wall. The charger also charges the stock battery just fine. 
2299 great price, couldn t pass on it! 
2300 I have not used it much seems to work extremely well with my Olympus and Panasonic cameras and lenses. Bit is very compact and relatively light compared to other travel tripods. I would recommend this tripod. 
2301 small, convenient, takes great photos. lucky to have gotten it at such a low price. 
2302 Much smaller and lighter than the one that came with the camera. Liked it so much, I bought a second as a backup. Much less expensive than the OEM charger as well. 
2303 Perfect fit 
2304 Great camera, great price for a variety of capabilities. Intuitive and easy to use. 
2305 Work amazing 
2306 This is a great filter. Works for long exposure photography. I was able to get some great images of Oregon coastal waters. I really like this filter. 
2307 It doesn t change stop-wise when you spin it. I d return it if it wasn t a hassle. 
2308 Nice quality sling bag 
2309 It s hard to operate. It records shorts videos. Don t know why it only record couple of seconds and that s it! 
2310 Will keep your GoPro from sinking to the bottom of the lake or ocean. Worth the price for peace of mind. 
2311 they broke off 
2312 Just what I needed and had hoped for ! 
2313 Very Nice little set works great for small simple things to photograph. Everything fits into the carrying case the box comes in. 
2314 perfect fit for Sony RX100 II camera. protection looks great. Good quality 
2315 Still not pleased with the shots after upgrading to this model. 
2316 This cord works better than I expected. Both ends have locking mechanisms, and TTL data is transmitted accurately. I use this between a Sony NEX-7 and Sony HVL-F43AM. Flash zoom automatically adjusts as the lens zooms. 
2317 This camera exceeded my expectation. The video is clear speaker works well. I am not a very tech oriented person but it was easy to set up. I did have a question called them and they answered it. 
2318 Speedy delivery, great value. Bought these accessories for my GoPro Hero (Basic Camera) - all appear well made & fit nicely, although some of the clips are quite tight ,but not a bad thing 
2319 Just completed setup of this cam. Works great! Controls on the app are a little clunky but the picture is great. 
2320 I ordered this in error [simply forgot a previous order for another brand]. It is tiny and seemed cheaply made, but I never took it out of the package. Its appearance and the lack of heft of the package were decisive in my returning this one, 
2321 A little pricey but fits perfectly. Wish they d make one for the CN-600 Chinese-made 1x1 light panel. 
2322 [[VIDEOID:1265e860a2218c46de5b2737a24b8ded]]The telescoping handle part works fine, but the phone holder attachment is horribly designed. Just watch my video to see how the phone shoots out of it! 
2323 2 work good, but one has dim IR LEDS 
2324 I haven t used this near as much as I d thought I would. I usually just plug the camera straight into a normal USB plug and swap the batteries through the camera. The spares are nice. 
2325 This works ok, but it s not as sturdy as I would like it to be. I would not recommend this for DSLRs that has a battery pack connected because its too heavy for this monopod. 
2326 Must have for speed light photography 
2327 Great camera sling. Holds camera to the side, out of the way. 
2328 Just as described 
2329 Great Picture and easy set up. Great tech support also.... 
2330 Excellent fit and smooth operation 
2331 very good work great 
2332 tough and well made, but terrible image quality. had to return it 
2333 GoPro...what else? 
2334 a 
2335 Great for single wire 
2336 Holds GoPro from going under 
2337 Fits the camera perfectly and is light. 
2338 Fit and worked great on my Nikon lenses. Old and modern models. 
2339 Amazing product. I need readers to check my photos on the LCD screen of my Canon EOS T3i and with this product I no longer have to change into my readers. Makes my workflow much faster. Really love this product! 
2340 Camera lens was mess up. Canon replace this camera with a other refur camera! 
2341 Nice Camera as a replacement for the one I had stollen, Easy to use and one I can understand! 
2342 Great accessory for GoPro hero 4 black. 
2343 does not work with wide angle lens ,bizzar colors on fringes of frame!! 
2344 Nice package! 
2345 Terrible product - cheap - couldn t get it off my Nikon lens after I installed it!!!! 
2346 A great little light for the price. It has a battery level indicator, dimmer knob and color temp selector and is quite bright even in daylight. The included battery and charger were a nice bonus and its quite slim which makes it easy to pack and carry. 
2347 Worked great and perfect fit on Nikon D7100. Came in hard case for glass with cleaning wipe and dust removing film to help install. 
2348 If you are a camera user, you are going to use it with the special strap. Best bang for the buck 
2349 I love this camera ,the only thing no manual 
2350 Perfect and handy to keep on the ready for that needed quick record. 
2351 Legit. 
2352 I love it. 
2353 Returned. Did not work. 
2354 It s good and I m happy with the product so far 
2355 Great lens for the price. Just wish it had gaskets like some of the others to make it water tight. But it does come with adapters for both naked camera and housing 
2356 Last as long as stock battery. 
2357 love these filters. very helpfull in my learning process. 
2358 Very clear picture and &#34;user friendly&#34; app. Great product. 
2359 Doing great so far! It s a great camera! Awesome zoom. The only problem i have with it is it didn t come with a cord to plug it into the computer. I had to go buy my own. It was a pain. But the camera itself is wonderful! 
2360 It was a little snug in my Kirkland carry on but works as expected. I would definitely recommend this product to family and friends. 
2361 It s hard to take a picture when case is attached, because it gets in the way. The quality of the product is as advertised. 
2362 Lens is great. Perfect for long shots. Filters are not great. They came scratched and one had a bubble defect. 
2363 Great camera with true colors. 
2364 Great quality screen protector. Well worth the price given the value of my NEX 7 camera. 
2365 love my contour, its been through a tough mudder on the first use, Still works and looks great, waiting for snowboarding season 
2366 cuando vuelve a estar disponible? no pude comprarlo when it becomes available ? I could not buy it 
2367 Came very fast and high quality!!! 
2368 sweet and fit perfect thank you 
2369 Battery just stop working after a month 
2370 I use this to hook up my mini beams projector weighing around 1 pound. No hassle and built with quality. 
2371 The Slik replacement post is an excellent product and a much better bargain than I ve found other places. As these little gems are easily lost I m pleased to know where to find them at a reasonable price. 
2372 Perfect and arrived on time. Thanks. 
2373 Works perfectly. 
2374 Worked great with more than enough lighting. I ordered 2 and received 4. I guess that was my mistake, so now if I return the extra order they will charge me shipping. I guess I will just keep in my storage. 
2375 Or if one breaks.. 
2376 At first I thought it wouldn t work because there were two prongs on the charger and three contacts on the batteries. However, I put in a battery, the light turned red, and it turned blue when it was charged. Then the battery worked fine in my camera. 
2377 Nice 
2378 Extra padding for when you load up your bag - works well. 
2379 Jim needs help to install this item. There are no directions nor installing device. 
2380 VERY NICE 
2381 perfect, work just like the original, maybe better due to longer life of each charge 
2382 Excellent fit and finish - although it cost more than the other brands I feel it s worth it. Dislike the cheap copy cat hoods. 
2383 In the description it said it was compatable with my camera, after opening the package the batteries didn t even come close to fitting. The company was very easy to work with and issuing a refund 
2384 It does what I purchased it for, protect my lens. Solid. 
2385 An amazing new &#34;toy&#34; for me to use to take photos. 
2386 They really work very well! 
2387 FREAKING AWESOME!!!! And so much more! 
2388 High quality product, great price, fast shipping. It fits perfectly to my Sony A77 and very convenient, When I don t use it just close it down. Thanks for great product. 
2389 I bought this as part of the Indigogo campaign and can definitely recommend it. It is well thought out, simple to use, quick to set up and easy to install! Definitely good value and recommended! 
2390 Quality case perfectly fits my gear. 
2391 good 
2392 ok 
2393 It s very thin and cheaply made (I guess you get what you pay for). I am not happy with this product at the moment. I will attempt to hang it and take a few photos too see how it shows up on camera. 
2394 Had this camera in red and lost it on a trip. I love the camera and wanted to replace it. 
2395 excellent product 
2396 Batteries 
2397 I wish the padded strip was a little but wider because my Canon G7X is somewhat heavy which makes the this strip uncomfortable. 
2398 Not happy spent alot of money for something that doesnt work. Emailed seller about it no reply of course. So i guess no refund 
2399 great starter kit 
2400 Very happy with the item. batteries charge quickly. The cleaning kit was a bonus as I hadn t expected that to be included. (was originally looking for charger and batteries.) 
2401 I suppose they work fine, or my daughter would have said something. The pack was a great buy for what you get, and if you plan on taking a camera anywhere, you ll definitely want a couple extra battery packs. 
2402 NICE TO HAVE 
2403 Very nice small case for a very small price:) 
2404 Decent quality, easy to apply 
2405 great balance between a pro camera and your phone camera. Portable and easy to use. Goes through batteries like mad, though, recommend ordering a few extra and a portable charger. 
2406 thanks 
2407 This is what I ask for and was on time shipping. 800ft of wire, you can not beat the price! 
2408 This light is brilliant! The adjustments are great, it has a digital display on the back. It is completely silent too! 
2409 Love this lens 
2410 Far better price than OEM. Batteries have held up well since purchase 1 1/2 years ago. Though OEM battery tends to last longer. 
2411 Excellent bag 
2412 Filter was delivered on time and is a good value for the money. 
2413 Perfect! 
2414 This is an awesome set for my Casio coolpic camera. It will be nice to have the second battery for back up as well as the car charger. It is a great price for all that you get 
2415 Camera is very good... 
2416 Good camera, good quality video. My biggest complaint is that when you are reviewing what has been recorded you cant fast forward. That s very frustrating. 
2417 Great value! Seller ships quickly. Product is just as described. I was expecting the bag to be smaller and of lesser quality and was pleasantly surprised. 
2418 Nice room space 
2419 LOVE IT!!!! its exactly what you see online, it also shipped super fast. :) 
2420 I haven t used this selfie stick much so I am still learning what all it can do but what I have used it for I am VERY happy with it s performance. 
2421 This is my walk-around lens for my A6000. It s a really good lens, for the price. If you use Lightroom, which has a lens profile for it, you can easily fix photos taken with it (barrel, etc). Definitely my favorite Sony lens to date. 
2422 Works perfectly 
2423 No button to take pictures! Useless 
2424 No paper work won t buy again 
2425 Easy to install, just 3M tape peel and stick. So far so good, but it s only been 1 day. The angle adjustment is great as well. 
2426 Actually showed up 2 weeks earlier than estimated. Was exactly what was pictured and it s actually a pretty good camera. 
2427 too small to properly contain camera... 
2428 Do not purchase. I was able to use the lens a few times with my iPhone 3s before everything just fell apart. 
2429 Item as described, acceptable shipping time, thanks 
2430 Processed, received as anticipated without delay or issue. 
2431 Piece of garbage! It broke within three minutes of me taking it out of the box! definitely want money back. 
2432 great products. Thanks 
2433 Fits perfectly in my Hardig case. The foam was easy to pluck to fit the items that I put in the case 
2434 Awesome. Comfortable all day with a heavy camera and lens combination. Great design! 
2435 Just got this for my birthday and I love it. The instructions are very easy to follow and the pictures come out great. My only advice is to make sure that you take pictures closer than you normally would because the pictures are small. I would recommend buying. 
2436 Great deal! 
2437 A 
2438 Great 
2439 GooD 
2440 Very happy with my Canon ESO Rebel T5i Digital Camera. It take wonderful pictures and easy to use! 
2441 Works as designed. Not meant for high impact use but gets the job done. 
2442 Hard to find, worked as expected 
2443 GREAT .... Love It ! ! 
2444 Very happy with it 
2445 Excellent lens and worth the money. Great service from Amazon. 
2446 Everything came as described. The battery is compatible with my Canon camcorder and the battery indicator shows up on the screen. 
2447 I bought this camera for my granddaughter for her 8th grade graduation and she loved it. 
2448 looks like it is the real thing. Works great quality 
2449 Great product. Works perfectly for elder parents who leave their sliding door unlocked. 
2450 Fit my go pro hero 4 like a sheep skin glove :) 
2451 I am a big hit again. My grandaughter thinks this is the cats meow. Loves loves it 
2452 Meets my standard for the cost. My son enjoyed a week of flying, but then the drone did as all before it..... Took a dive. 
2453 good item and excellent seller 
2454 This is EXACTLY what I needed! I bought this to use my Canon 580EX speedlight off camera and would have paid double/triple the amount. I Have had the opportunity to use it many times and it has never failed me. 
2455 does its job!! 
2456 Very sturdy. Very user friendly. Best customer service ever!!! 
2457 great 
2458 When it works, it s what I expected, but this disconnects very frequently which is frustrating. 
2459 Pros:Easy to set up.the feature to show which switch is on is a good idea Cons: LCD screen almost npossable to read. 
2460 cheap and holds full and long charge 
2461 Pretty decent for the price!!! 
2462 Can not find SN at the filter. It seem that s normal. If there are seal at both side will be better! 
2463 Worked well for placing my camera on a strap and folding to put my camera on a tripod, it is a hassle sometimes as the loop is not solid but that is what makes it be able to fit onto certain camera mounts. 
2464 Good product 
2465 Love this case, my Nikon 7100 with the Tamron 150-600 mm lens fit perfect. You have to remove the lens hood and reverse it over the lens. Camera an lens slide out with no problem. Wide padded strap makes it very comfortable to carry. I highly recommend this case. 
2466 Fits perfectly. 
2467 not worth it even if free - bad photos - battery compartments won t stay closed - everytime battery comes out loses memory. One of the 2 didn t even work had to send back. 
2468 Actual product User manual says sd card (the PDF), Amazon description says sd card, I bought a SD CARD. It in fact uses a micro sd card. Sad... 
2469 Lens adaptors are tricky to make as designers, except for the Maxuum-Sony Alpha systems, do not make cameras with consistent thicknesses. 
2470 Great product 
2471 Fantastic purchase came really quickly works great. 
2472 Awesome 
2473 good 
2474 Excellent Bino s for the price. Very good focus and clarity. 
2475 Used it thankyou 
2476 It s the best one I ve used. 
2477 I just use this camera just 3 times .but, shutter it s not working.I don t like it 
2478 So far, everything works well in this kit. I use it with my Canon T3i. The softbox was a bit damaged but nothing that could not be fixed with a bit of glue. 
2479 directions were in chinese:/ 
2480 Best Camera I ever have had. 
2481 Good product 
2482 Great little grip for my E-M5 Mark ii. The only downside is that trying to replace the battery is somewhat of a chore, however the Lock/Unlock dial does make this somewhat less of a hassle. 
2483 Love it! 
2484 Excellent optics, great at its primary function but not enough thread to properly secure my hood lead to it being lost. 
2485 Zero firmware updates. Need ActiveX to configure Motion Detection. Why is this old junk still for sale? 
2486 It works well with Canon 5Dii; but it lacks the shoe to attach to the camera, i would reduce it to 4 stars. 
2487 Worked great while on the road. Kept the camera dry and dust free. 
2488 Love this poser! It took about 30-45 minutes to fill. It does help to use a cardboard tube to guide the beanbag beans. Made the process much smoother! 
2489 very blocky when at max magnification. 
2490 Very well made item. I tried a cheaper after mkt. grip and it was next to worthless. This Sony grip is quick and looks great. 
2491 Doesn t stay connected as well as I d like, but with some ingenuity I made it work. 
2492 Good lense 
2493 great product 
2494 Works perfect. Good Value. 
2495 Cheap Junk don t buy it. It don t work right out of the box. now I m stuck with it and out the money. 
2496 Charged fast batteries work fine. 
2497 Awesome stuff 
2498 I bought this as a gift for my hubby and he loves it. Great for his camera and other stuff .he loves the different compartment...it s his weekend bag. 
2499 packed for earthquake, just as expected from add 
2500 Hard to get the velcro band tight, otherwise it worked 
2501 1st test of my Limefuel L55G3 on Hero3+ was a timelapse, 2sec interval at 7mp per. The battery lasted 14 hours and 16 minutes, 48.9GB on the card. Amazing. 
2502 Works as expected. 
2503 Great product as advertised 
2504 Fits my Nikon D600 like a glove :) 
2505 It s what I needed. 
2506 Great Product. Im happy with it. 
2507 Very nice for travel 
2508 Pretty disappointing. I want a 15-in + frame to display professional quality photos and so far have found nothing that seems to please other discriminating viewers. Surely someone must make a quality frame. Cost is not a major factor but quality is top priority. Anyone have suggestions? 
2509 Too bad it is no longer in production! 
2510 The best sandals for pronation and very comfortable. I have to wear orthopedics, but can wear these sandals for a few hours and have no pain.Good support for feet. 
2511 the GoPro works great! the picture and video quality is amazing. Definitely the best product I ve bought in a while. 
2512 Works as described ~ fast delivery. 
2513 Great item, plan on it going traveling with me and to sports events. 
2514 Great. Like all aspects of this camera. Telephoto is fantastic. 
2515 Does what I need, but &#34;pole&#34; which comes in sections is pretty flimsy. I wouldn t last long outdoors. Luckily, we need it in the garage. 
2516 Worked perfectly and arrived ahead of schedule. 
2517 Excellent picture, easy install and setup. Adding extra cameras is very simple. I m quite pleased. 
2518 Paired up with my Note 4 really quick and i like the way it fits. I like the ability to unsnap the measuring unit as well. Good price well see how it holds up 
2519 I would like that has buttons to zoom in and out. But works ok 
2520 It s so obvious that these are all fake reviews, who runs a business like this? 
2521 For the price this is an excellent Item. The batteries last a long while and the brightness is superb. I m a high schools sports videographer and I do on field/court interviews and the lights worked much better than expected. 
2522 Works as advertised. 
2523 This is a great alternative for the clip in lens cap. I bought it based on all the positive reviews it received and am glad I did. 
2524 Looses electric connection after a few weeks. Wouldn t recommend getting. 
2525 There is no way to use an ocular (eyepiece) lens with this adapter. As a result there is no way to focus the microscope image in the camera. Spend about $90 instead and get an adapter with a lens included. 
2526 love this camera 
2527 LOVE THIS CAMERA! So easy to use, directions and set up very simple. No difficult wiring or issues! The quality of the picture is amazing also. Would strongly recommend this camera! Super simple and great product! 
2528 Item was as described, was delivered promptly, and worked with my old FD lens. Will shop with this vendor again. 
2529 I wish the strap held together a bit better but other wise it s a great looking case and it shipped right on time. 
2530 It is OK, have not actually broken in yet therefore will not know how long the battery will last. 
2531 Really weak and flimsy, overall wished I spent more money on a strap. 
2532 Awesome is all I can say 
2533 Perfect for indoor photography! 
2534 great for the price 
2535 so glad to have this replacement for my camera...perfect 
2536 gift 
2537 Good bargain price for batteries that do the same as OEM batteries. I was in Washington on business and searched the whole area for this battery, found one store with one unit in stock. These work great and hold a charge well. 
2538 As expected. 
2539 GOOD PRODUCT, WELL CONSTRUCTED EASY TO HANDLE AND DO THE JOB VERY GOOD. I LOVE IT AND I RECOMENDED. 
2540 works great,enjoy the different settings and sounds 
2541 on windy days I believe my flag sets it off,will have to reposition it. 
2542 Very good. 
2543 as predicted. 
2544 Great product! Very useful and practical! 
2545 This Film works just fine in a new (to me) camera that I just bought. 
2546 Great quality tripod. Works with my SLR camera, andreally helps for those longer exposures 
2547 LOUD. If you want to make sure people know when your alarm goes off, get this. 
2548 Cheap, flimsy & very small. Also the 2 tire &#34;stops&#34; were paid for but not shipped. Shipping time was fine. 
2549 BLAST CAN USE IT ANYWHERE 
2550 The battery fits and works great. I use it in a Canon 60D and it charges at about the same rate as the factory battery. I have only had it for a couple of weeks, so nothing to report on longevity. 
2551 Works well for my Canon camera 
2552 Just as described with super fast shipping! 
2553 inner partitions does not stay in place 
2554 Wow how freaking awesome! I ordered and a day later it came to my front door. The batteries work and hold a great charge and the charger sits on my desk taking NO room. Very happy and for the price I might just buy another set. 
2555 Fast shipping good battery! I would recommend as a spare battery :) 
2556 works exactly as described. Paired easily. Works with iPad, no problem. 
2557 Great lens ! My significant other purchased this for me as a surprise and absolutely love it! Will be great for portraits instead of having to rent nice lenses. Seems to do the best around f 3.2 and 3.5 , very crisp details and nice bokeh! 
2558 Excellent purchase! 
2559 Good however could not get strap to stay on. 
2560 I like it 
2561 I love these batteries, I use them in my Cannon 70 D. What an amazing addition to my camera and at the price you can t say no. Well worth it. 
2562 It worked perfectly with my Cannon 60D. 
2563 Bought used and VERY satisfied 
2564 Small and compact! Ready for on the go and easy to use. 
2565 Works excellent with very easy set up. Took about 10 minutes total. Mounted it to a wall with included hardware and we were ready to go. Works on both my Samsung S5 and my wife s iPhone 6. 
2566 it fits well on my gopro hero 3+ waterproof housing 
2567 Just testing it out I found that the Wi-Fi did not work despite the phone or laptop and the battery life is poor. Still waiting to take it to the sea and see if it is really &#34;water proof&#34; to up to 90 feet. 
2568 Work great and are WAY cheaper than OEM. 
2569 Very nice cleaning cloths. They are the perfect size for cleaning glasses & cell phones. I also like the variety of colors. 😀 
2570 Had to return as it never worked. Return was easy enough. 
2571 Very cheaply made. Feels cheaply made. My copy activated the shutter just by jiggling the wires 
2572 Just what I was looking, looks great on my Nikon D5500 with 18-140 lens 
2573 This product worked about 3hours then 2 of the motors burned out. One wont even turn junk!!! 
2574 Really works it saved us from flooded home. 
2575 Love the device. First generation needed a wider lens, but looks like the second generation has that covered. 
2576 It has slipped off a couple times. But in fairness, I may not have put it entirely on. It doesn t fit over the lens filters I purchased. 
2577 Excellent product at a good price. It works flawlessly with my Panasonic FZ200. My only criticism for this device, as other reviewers have commented, is that the device is not very intuitive and the documentation is cryptic at best. 
2578 Works Awesome! One of the easiest Pano heads I have ever used. 
2579 I am using this for my canon camera. For the price, it is excellent. I like the size and the material is good. 
2580 Works pretty much exactly as I wanted. Let s me use my Sigma 30mm f1.4 and my old Minolta MD 150mm on the M3. 
2581 These replacement batteries fit and work great 
2582 excellent 
2583 worked as advertised but complicated to set up remote access. Had to get tech help and working remotely now. 
2584 this was just what i needed...it works great...thanks for the help finding this on amazon.. 
2585 Thankyou 
2586 Liked the design for a certain bridge I bridge camera I own. 
2587 Glad to have another way to charge my batteries. I love that this charger came with 2 extra batteries as well. 
2588 Using this on my Tokina 11-16mm dxii. No vignetting and no image degradation. Screws on and off effortlessly. Love the textured grip? 
2589 Pelican products are very well-made. This particular case is small. If you need more space, Pelican makes many more models from which to choose. 
2590 Efficient , Thanks 
2591 [[ASIN:B00W1BEENK AC 110V 3 Way Touch Control Sensor Switch Dimmer Lamp Desk Light Parts]] Easy install, seemed to work but in less than a week it started turning on the light by itself. This has continued since I installed it. How do I get a replacement?? 
2592 Work very well, sometimes the camera reads the battery power level incorrectly but this is fairly rare. 
2593 Wore it to play in a beer league hockey tournament and it stopped working properly after the 1st day. Do not recommend it 
2594 This now completes my set up. I have ordered one of these before and have had no problems. I expect the same, this time around. Easy to install and should at least slow the bad guys down. 
2595 Better and cheaper than GO Pro! The Wi-Fi and the SONY App are awesome! I can control the camera by my mobile!!!! 
2596 It works but would not work with Chrome. Contacted support and got no reply. I don t think I would by another one. 
2597 Works great. Perfect fit. Feels pretty solid. 
2598 as described. Very happy with it. 
2599 There is less then year when I bought this camera and it doesnt work anymore 
2600 Small, and easy to use. Pictures are good. I just wish I would have notice that the review size was really small. Otherwise good deal. 
2601 Sharp Optics, Light Weight, Easy to use, Nothing better available in a Zoom 8-16x25 for the price! Very pleased with its performance. 
2602 My wife and I love our new Nest cam. It works exactly as billed and we love having a Nest home. 
2603 Works great - a must have! 
2604 works pretty good, not great a night...really bummed that it doesnt have extra ports for more cameras-4 doesnt even cover my exterior. you would think they would have extra ports so you could add on if necessary 
2605 I love this lens cap. I like the squeeze on and off. It s very secure yet easy to remove. No, it doesn t dangle from the string, but it could be attached to a longer more useful string if you wanted that feature. I just removed the string. 
2606 As advertised, great. 
2607 Must have for DSLR users that don t always shoot over the shoulder. 
2608 would recommend 
2609 Quick delivery excellent product. It is a little narrow for my big old head, but not a BIG deal. 
2610 Arrived on time and as expected. 
2611 My son commented my videos look much better since using device. 
2612 Excellent connectors. Do their job insuring a secure camera attachment. Don t have to worry about clips opening and spilling your expensive camera on the ground. The Op/Tech clips do seem very adequate to secure camera but the Velcro connectors give extra piece of mind, just in case... 
2613 It is a great product it met my expectations it is awesome to use it on big places and see the difference between a normal lense and a fish eye or wide angle 
2614 This is a very lightweight tripod and seems to be very steady. It will take some practice to use it quickly though. This isn t a complaint. Its much lighter than my other tripod and I plan to take it on some field trips later this year. 
2615 Does what it promises to do. 
2616 disappointed in the filter. didn t think it enhanced the images nearly as much as I d hoped 
2617 Perfect. Precisely what I ordered. As described. 
2618 does exactly what it should. works great! 
2619 these camera replacements are excellent for my system and a great buy, will definitely recommend these to my friends and family. 
2620 You get what you pay for, all lens are good but the Telephoto Lens distords the image on the sides and has to be used at maximum zoom or you will see the round black edges on your screen. 
2621 cheap and weak 
2622 Awesome accessories! Great price! 
2623 Great Quality - we recommend this item! I ve waited a long time for the perfect digital camera!!! 
2624 Great price and good condition 
2625 the remote control is included? 
2626 Needs to send a charger with it. 
2627 Awesome battery for the money, great customer service after the sale also. 
2628 As usual the case is top notch Pelican Case. Have been using Pelicans for my firearms for years so I got the 1300 for my girls Sony DSLR camera. Pick-n-pluck foam is easy and holds gear securely and it does have the double throw latches. 
2629 Works very well, needs 9 V batteries 2 times a year and re-positioning but I have had it for about six years now and it s still ringing, 
2630 Incredible deal for the price. I ve seen others for three times the price! 
2631 Although the labeling read &#34;Product generally ordered when lens is purchased&#34;, the fact is the product is not needed since the lens already come with a shield. 
2632 Great 
2633 Awesome 
2634 I bought this lens to replace the plastic nifty 50 I ve had for a while. I can see right off, this lens is quite good, but probably not as good as the top of the line 50mm. But,I like it. 
2635 Universal camera battery charger. Product as described and has adaptors for different brands. Charger says its a Vivitar but with an adapter that fits my Canon camera. Works great and comes with a spare battery. 
2636 Excellent! 
2637 Finally!!! An awesome gadget backpack, for all the chargers, ereaders, camera, lens, videocamera, sdcards, cables. There is room for everything. Great for travelling and keeping all our stuff organized. 
2638 i use 
2639 Lots of pockets, lightweight and easy to carry. Makes you look official :) 
2640 Item shipped quickly and was exactly as described. 
2641 Great bag, holds more than it looks like, would recommend it 
2642 THEY DID NOT WORK ON ANY DEVICE!!!!! 
2643 Lots of useful items in the kit , charger is worth the price alone 
2644 Ok for a monopod, feels cheap and unsteady with a Nikon d610 attached. Good enough for a point and shoot though. Upgraded to a a Manfrotto monopod shortly after purchasing this. Should have just skipped this one. 
2645 Works great. Let s me use old manual lens with my Sony a6000. 
2646 Camera is good. Setup instructions are not clear. But you will figure out after trying few times. I like phone view and send pics by email. I am not using upload to cloud feature 
2647 What do you say, They work great! 
2648 Excellent product 
2649 I have been using these pens for a few years and i like them for the convenience mainly.They do their job and are light and compact. 
2650 An excellent camera with excellent accessories. The camera arrived quickly and was well packed. 
2651 Cheap threads stuck 
2652 First day I had it battery overheated and fried all electronics. Video quality was radically bad after that!. I checked and it was a genuine product, but I got a lemon. Also batery refused to charge after that! 
2653 I love my new album it matches my camera so cute thank you 
2654 Works Good! 
2655 excelent 
2656 Received what you order. It came in a timely manner. 
2657 I was very excited for my wife to take professional photos of my baby daughter but honestly our I phone has better resolution not happy 
2658 I am still learning to use it so will have a better idea of how I like it after more use. 
2659 Works well. No stability but for the money it is a good lens. Quick focus but not as fast as the more expensive lenses out there. 
2660 Works well. Fits well It would be nice to have threads on both ends so you could stack them. 
2661 Love it. Perfect Bag. 
2662 Worked out great on a trip up to Pacific Northwest. Protected from rain and dust. Thanks 
2663 everything worked fine 
2664 Great, economical surveillance system. Easiest Tech I have set up. 
2665 Great lenses, great pictures, great price. Not noisy at all. The remote works great and lots of fun. The tripod is a little week but does the job and very light. 
2666 Well made and works great. 
2667 So far so good, haven t noticed any issues. Quick delivery as always using Prime. 
2668 This is my go to portrait lens for natural light portraits. At 2.8 it makes a powerful low light lens plus a nice portrait lens for shallow depth of field for nice bokeh. For the price this is an excellent lens. 
2669 Great product. Shipped all together. It s a great gift for teens. 
2670 This camara is better than I EXPECETED. Great. 
2671 The case blocks the cameras ability to connect to the wireless access point. If you buy this you better have the camera within about 25 feet of your access point 
2672 nice product. 
2673 GREAT PROTECTION FOR CAMERA. 
2674 This is just what I needed. It works fine. I love Canon products. I just misplaced my original one. 
2675 Did not notice there was no way to take the picture with the stick 
2676 Ok 
2677 I found what I wanted and I was really excited. But when it came in the mail it was the wrong product. 
2678 A+++ 
2679 A nice bit of added security when going strapless. 
2680 Great way to get my footage 
2681 Works great. Peace of mind when you are away from home. 
2682 Expected this to be a little better but i will definitely use. The dimmer capability is nice but wish they were just a tad brighter. For the price i guess i can t complain. 
2683 My daughter likes it. 
2684 This kit is awesome!! Thanks)) 
2685 Product recieved as described and in the time frame as specified. 
2686 I bought this for my Sony A6000 it works great. I took my time cleaning and cleaning the screen again it went on well and with no air bubbles. It did not add any bulk to the camera and I feel better knowing the screen is protected. 
2687 this does not work with hero 1 
2688 some of the stuff in this bundle is great, and some is cheap. bottom line is if you are not a pro, this is a great cheap bundle. I wouldn t pull these out for a professional photo shoot. 
2689 Good 
2690 Charged and powered my camera as expected. Good product. 
2691 Great bag for the price. Camera and lenses in padded secure, yet movable sections. I am impressed by the quality of this product. 
2692 screw not Tight enough for nexus 7, can not support 
2693 what can I say, expect for incredible. 
2694 Good 
2695 Received on time & seems to work fine. 
2696 Excellent and great seller 
2697 This floating hand grip works great. It s comfortable and secure. I took it to Hawaii and got some awesome snorkeling and waterfall photos & video. Glad I opted for the GoPro brand - high quality, fits my GoPro perfectly. 
2698 the case holds a ton of stuff. i ve got a couple housings and naked housings in there with the headstrap, cables, dual battery charger and mounts and it still fits extremely well. 
2699 Nice bags will last a long time. 
2700 Awesome 
2701 Does just what I expected. Autofocus is slow and hunts, but for landscape work it s not a problem. Main thing I purchased it for was aperture control and it does the job nicely. I recommend it 
2702 This is a very nicely made cap, and the strap is a good add-on. Not sure where (or how) to attach the strap but overall it s nice constructed and lightweight. 
2703 The lens cases are excellent quality at a very reasonable price. I would highly recommend them. Bill Dunlap, EasternSierraPhotography.com 
2704 Perfect fit for my nikon d5300 and a spare small lens 
2705 Quality SCT diagonal both optically as well as fit and finish. Comes with a great case that protects it very well. The price is the most reasonable found for a 2&#34; dielectric diagonal for an SCT. 
2706 D-rate too low, zeiss lens does not show good Saturation, Effective focus range too little, dont expect it can make any bokeh or blurry background at all. 
2707 I probably us this more than any other accessory for my GoPro... 
2708 I never could get this to work properly, don t waist your money 
2709 Great tripod! Not very light but still easy to carry around. Love feature on coverting it to monopod. Ball head is good too. Easy to adjust. Color nice and vivid. The only downside is a tighting bolt which i wish had a different design. 
2710 waste moeny at all 
2711 nice 
2712 I really like this camera. My only complaint is the LED on top is hard to see in the sunlight. It takes really good video. Its size makes it easy to take anywhere. The waterproof case works very well and is worth buying. 
2713 Decent batteries, will buy again. Some people have trouble taking the battery out of the charger, little pressure toward the way the arrow points and the battery comes out easy. 
2714 This may be small in size, but it is a good aluminum alloy...It locks without much effort, and holds my 3 pound camera very securely.. This one may cost a bit more, but your trusting it by putting very expensive cameras on it...So I highly recommend it... 
2715 I actually ordered this for my ring bearer so he could feel like a spy with a briefcase. He loved it! (And, all the stuff I put inside.) :) Great size! Just what I was looking for! Not small! 
2716 Satisfied! 
2717 need to get more. lovely gift. 
2718 Perfect for water use 
2719 Awesome! Everything was in perfect condition when it arrived. 
2720 Love it. Took it on a cruise and got great pics! 
2721 Cheap 
2722 Just as advertised 
2723 I was worried about ordering any electronics from online, but I had nothing to worry about. It was excellent condition!! Works beautifully and gets the job done!! LOW priced and fast shipping!! Feel safe when ordering from this seller!! Thank you!! 
2724 The remote control (RM-E2) does not work with the Nikon D3200 as indicated in the description of the set. 
2725 just what I needed 
2726 Have not had a bad experience with any of the Polaroid filters, so far. 
2727 Add a little brightness to your photos 
2728 great pics 
2729 The screen on the viewer has developed a line thru the center of the screen after owning it for one month, also frustrating to try to set up the recording to meet my needs, I guess you get what you pay for, not recommended!! 
2730 Not 100% waterproof 
2731 Floaty was great! Arrived on time and was just as described. Attached to my underwater camera and it really does float! 
2732 works great 
2733 Works great. 
2734 it works ... 
2735 Great cloths, they work just fine. 
2736 Works as well as or better than the &#34;official&#34; batteries at a much more favorable price and the charger is easier to use and transport that the factory-issued model. 
2737 Item as described. shipped quickly. Would purchase again. A+ 
2738 didn t work on my camera. I returned it. 
2739 good choice well worth the money. 
2740 This light is very small but very very bright. I will buy another one as it will only last for 1 hr. But it completely brightened the entire room. 
2741 Perfect protection for LCD screen. Real easy to install. Does not interfere with opening or closing screen. Wish I had this before the LCD became tarnished. Certainly priced right. 
2742 Battery lasted less than 50 shots. Return policy of 30 days stinks, since it does not seem to depend on whether product is defective or not. 
2743 Batteries are long lasting in my cameras. I will recommend these because they are the best 
2744 camera is great and all the add-ons were just what was shown. was disappointed taht there was not any user manual or other instructions on the use of the camera 
2745 kind of flimsy. 
2746 I think this is a great camera and quality of the video is on par with others. The audio output could be better but that s very minor. 
2747 This is a very good case, it s just that it s a little larger than what I needed for my camera. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. I think it will last forever and there is definitely room for extra batteries and all the cords. 
2748 Great pistol grip head. Just wish it was lighter. Beside this, it is a good deal. 
2749 These are a great way to keep an eye on your home. Great for constant visibility or just to check in occasionally. 
2750 Love it!!! 
2751 Works great.glad I purchased. I ve had some close calls when using my go pro in the lakes. 
2752 Very good case for my Tough4 camera. It fits perfectly! A great case. 
2753 Nice 
2754 The order came quickly and was a very great deal. 
2755 Better than the goPro stick! Very sturdy and I love the pouch for it! Best purchase I ve made in regards to an accessory. Very very pleased - never leave without it. 
2756 excelente 
2757 Henry great job done by tech. love the service.also camera works great. 
2758 Great for the price! Never owned or used a &#34;glidecam&#34; before. For my micro-budget films this thing is AWESOME. 
2759 It couldve been better but for the price what do you really expect? I dont really use it as much as I hoped I would because of its quality. 
2760 Very Well Satisfied. 
2761 should get two batterys for that price 
2762 Good product, great service, plus a good price! Paid a few dollars more for the &#34;warm fuzzies&#34; for the familiar Vivitar name.. 
2763 Ok 
2764 Very comfy and durable! Fit my camera perfectly and adjustable for when my husband wants to wear it! 
2765 Just awesome telphoto 
2766 Received as advertised 
2767 It is too red and not good for diving. 
2768 An OK lens but not for advanced photographers. 
2769 I love this gadget! I rarely have to charge it. If I use it with my computer, I will need to charge it more frequently but with other devices it just goes and goes. So glad I bought it. 
2770 Works great so far. I have not had a chance to assess longevity of the charge or of the battery itself. 
2771 Exact needed miniscule USB to standard cable for Nikon Coolpix as advertised. Plenty pleased. 
2772 This is the best Quadcopter out for the price by far! So easy to fly and the best 4K video. I find myself looking forward to flying it after work and on the weekends! This thing is loaded with tech and the flight control system is loaded with many features! 
2773 Great 
2774 Another excellent pelican product 
2775 Fantastic! Exactly as described! 
2776 Great product, still going strong a year later. I would recommend this battery to anyone. 
2777 the greatest thing to come around since sliced bread if you do green screen photography 
2778 BUY THIS KIT!!!! It is definitely worth investing in, and I film beauty videos and such and THIS LIGHTING KIT IMPROVES THE QUALITY 100%!!!! You can go see at www.youtube.com/daisygoldenprincess 
2779 this product real make a different I will order from this company again. 
2780 Easy to use, good quality!! 
2781 Great mount 
2782 works great 
2783 Product was as advertised. 
2784 Love this little thing. It s a lot bigger than it appears to be in the photo. I got it for my gopro hero 4 silver and it s amazing. 
2785 Quite nice and handy wireless remote. I use it with my D5300 and found it to be quite good. 
2786 All is working fine! 
2787 Nice case, fits our camera well, plus extra batteries. 
2788 ok 
2789 Magnification is not as much as I expected. Focus knob has no fine tune focus. Barlow lense is low quality. But a good basic telescope for the price. 
2790 love this dash cam 
2791 Works great and works with our camera and battery charger. 
2792 Great item. 
2793 It is not mentioned that the flash is working with manual adjusting - I would have never bought it!!! 
2794 Quick service and great product. Exactly what I needed 
2795 My Minolta A mount lenses mount firmly with this adapter. 
2796 Fits perfect! Can t believe I got a 5 pk for this price! These fit snuggly so I may not lose them as often. Prompt delivery too.......I typically wait much longer for items from China. 
2797 I think they are great, could not find them locally, my camera works great, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING THEM.... 
2798 It s a battery. It works fine. 
2799 Pelican just makes great cases. Not much else to be said. 
2800 Anyone else keep losing these guys? Just bought this 5 pack. Problem solved. 
2801 Excellent Quality and speedy shipping! 
2802 The camera works great, nice control, night vision good Kenneth from tech support helped with setup, great job 
2803 Great machine but get extra parts and batteries. Great starter drone. 
2804 I bought this for my fiancé (who is a graphic artist) and he loves it! It has lots of high end features to take AMAZING pictures with a quality rivaling professional photographers. This is a great camera! 
2805 awesome just as described thank 
2806 best towel for cleaning anything 
2807 very good 
2808 Cool 
2809 Buy as many as you can! I use them for everything. 
2810 Very fast autofocus, brilliant image quality, and the stabilization is great too. My one gripe about this lens (and a reason I may sell it in the future) is that it s just really heavy! 
2811 Works good for my SonyRX100 2. Fits just like factory batteries, charger works fine. 
2812 Not what i was expecting 
2813 The lens kit brings the image into focus pretty well, but you need to use the tripod, or maybe I shake too much. Its a nice little piece that works better than others I ve tried. Takes a little while to learn to position it as you like. 
2814 Working well for my needs 
2815 Good 
2816 Button fell after a few weeks of receiving it, and not due to overuse! Unable to return item, had to purchase another. 
2817 Very happy with camera. Everything I hoped it would be for the price. 
2818 wonderful not heavy and very easy ti use 
2819 Great Product Works just like it is supposed to easy to install 
2820 Good deal! 
2821 The items in this shipment We re good quality but this does NOT come with a bag. My order did not include all items advertised. There was no carrying bag. 
2822 Really nice pictures clean.. 
2823 Nothing really crazy out of the ordinary here, it was just what I needed!! 
2824 Excellent product. Holds charge for a considerable amount of time, especially whan camera is not used frequently. Highly reccommended 
2825 I purchased this item and what was delivered was a 22 Inch after measuring the item. 
2826 Review coming soon 
2827 Love it! Light weight reasonably priced and great quality. 
2828 works great! 
2829 It works OK. 
2830 Excellent battery life on demanding go pro hero4 silver. (Touch screen on go pro saps a lot of battery) The batteries last longer than the original go pro battery. The charging was fairly quick. Three batteries in a couple of hours at the most. 
2831 Kinda small so you don t feel like a real photographer, but the product itself is perfect 
2832 Don t waste your money. It broke the second time I used it. Base plate came off. guess I could glue back together but that s not the point. 
2833 Fits my canon rebel perfectly. I feel my camera is safe and protected in there. 
2834 Very Good Quality 
2835 Bought this item to replace a lost charget. I is exactly what I needed and works perfectly. 
2836 It ruin my phantom 1 I have to take it to get fixed now it s very unstable and crash right out of the sky  
2837 The camera is smarter than I am. 
2838 I m still trying to make it work it seem to have a mind of it s own i keep down loading, it wont hold the programs. The booklet is being read step by step 
2839 Great 
2840 Easy to sign up for. I have not needed to make any claims, thankfully. So, I don t know how the replacement/repair service is. I hope I don t need it. I will update this post if I use the service later. 
2841 Great deal, good quality replacement. 
2842 Everything about this case is amazing great quality and carries everything I need! High recommend this. Just wish it was airline carry on size but the quality and features make up for it 
2843 I wasn t sure if adding the lens would make that much of a difference. I was very surprised to see how much it did. Good quality and easy to attach. 
2844 Nice size, lots of pockets for accessories, sturdy construction, good padding! 
2845 Takes lousy pictures. I don t want to have to monkey around with pics on my computer...I just want to print or share quickly. I returned this. Guess you get what you pay for! 
2846 Great product, wish this would have came with the unit from the manufacture. Must have! 
2847 Love the bag, great value, great size. 
2848 nice bundle 
2849 It s worth buying to protect your gopro. 
2850 Haven t taken this out to use for the reason I bought it yet, but it will work just fine, I m sure. Seems pretty well made. Better than expected. 
2851 great 
2852 came in a timely manner, was undamaged, inserted the battery and was good to go. thank you 
2853 Handy little tripod, I use this thing everywhere. Wrap it around tree branches, wrap it around strings to do time lapse vids of storms coming in from my garage door opener. Wherever, this holds steady. 
2854 Very happy with purchase!!! 
2855 Exact match for OEM and works great. 
2856 Love this bag, comes with tons of padding and movable sections inside to customize. Love the vintage style. So Happy I ordered it. 
2857 Gift 
2858 LOVE this lens and the transaction. thanks 
2859 Not exatly what I needed, but will do. 
2860 I like this bag. The canvas fabric is really attractive and nice, and it doesn t scream &#34;steal me&#34; like a Nikon logo bag. It s a little tight for my D5100 kit, but it fits. I have not had any problems with the zippers that other reviewers have noted. 
2861 GREAT SMOKE ALARMS..... 
2862 Works perfect!!!! 
2863 These cords failed within one month of use. 
2864 BEST VALUE YET. PACKAGING CAME EARLIER THAN EXPECTED. VERY PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE! 
2865 Fits snugly as it was advertised to do.Great adapter,I d highly recommend it. 
2866 Perfect fit for my a66; eye viewfinder activation works fine. 1/3 the cost of a Sony replacement. 
2867 Great pics! The app for the smart phone is a lil wonky but works 
2868 camera fits perfect 
2869 4 of them in my house can check in anytime I am away or use as monitor with my phone or tablet 
2870 Great Product and video for the money. 
2871 Great build. Much better than Gary Fong lightsphere. You would think the velcro wouldn t hold up but it actually stays up. This is a great product especially, very flexible from macro, portrait, to group shots this met all my needs. Would definitely buy again. 
2872 This camera is so much fun and it takes the best pictures if you know how to use it correctly! 
2873 so far as good as original 
2874 works perfectly just like the original 
2875 just what i needed 
2876 Clear Picture. Easy Set up. Works better than I expected. 
2877 This lens is everything that I ve hoped for! Great quality photos! Quick delivery and wonderful supplier! 
2878 A necessity! I am pleased with the quality. There were enough pieces that I share half with my daughter. 
2879 doesnt fit right to original hero 4 unit. 
2880 You get what you pay for in terms of battery life. One of these lasts about half as long as a single Cannon brand battery. 
2881 Good stand for the price paid. The locking knobs are not very durable. Just be careful using it. It will work well. 
2882 Ok gave to friend. He is modify from his cameas 
2883 great!!! 
2884 heavy duty boom arm, not a flimsy toy. very happy with the quality of all Kupo products 
2885 what a bargain 
2886 Excellent cameras. The video is extra sharp, and they are very easy to install. 
2887 No surprises. Works as described. Good shipping to third party that was heading to Fiji in plenty of time. 
2888 Best case I have ever owned for my GoPro Hero 4 Black. Almost nearly fits all my accessories, but I mainly got this because it s a hard case and I wanted to protect my investment. 
2889 I brought Targus Digital Black Label TG-P60T tripod from RadioShack (big mistake). The quick release plate that was given in the box didn t fit. I search high and low for a plate that ll fit since it s small, this one works. 
2890 Really easy to use right out of the box. Got some great shots at 70 feet despite poor visibility. I can t wait to see what it will do in Caribbean waters. 
2891 This product is very great! It is not as translucent as some of the others when using a backlog and is highly durable for portraits. Photos always come out stunning with a black background and plexiglass flooring! 
2892 excellent camera 
2893 Bought for my wife she absolutely loves it more then anything she said best bday present ever 
2894 I have a large tripod. The triangle slot that is used to set the tray on the tripod is too small, meaning the tray is too high off the ground, or I have to reduce the spread on the tripod. 
2895 Works well with think tank bags. Great purchase! 
2896 bought 2 of these and worked fine ran on a 9v 400ma ac/dc converter one chip lost the blue lighting but the other works fine. 
2897 Just got back from a motorcycle trip. Several days in the rain and it held like iron. Very happy with this mount. 
2898 work as advertise 
2899 The worst part is that it is actually a really good monitor. with all the nobs and settings you can not turn off the volume. so basically you are stuck listening to what ever you are shooting. 
2900 I bought these to clean my hard to keep clean eyeglasses. The best cloths I have found for that purpose. They leave no streaks or residue. I also use them to clean my laptop computer screen. Excellent. 
2901 Fast delivery, product as described. Would do biz, again. 
2902 Great lights, easy to set up and AWESOME to use!! 
2903 Can t go wrong with this. Just toss it down somewhere in your picture and click on the gray when editing - all set. No fuss. No muss. 
2904 Good as backups. Do not last anywhere near as long as canon but still a good deal at this price. 
2905 Tray and buy,good to have more lights 
2906 Still learning how to use it but so far I m satisfied with the lens. It works very well and I m getting some great shots. 
2907 It worked great. 
2908 works ok sometimes the alarm goes off without any motion in its area have used the reset button several times 
2909 My manfrotto tripod fits in there great! 
2910 A little bit smaller than i imagend but works well,instruction manual not verry helpful 
2911 Fast delivery and really easy set up!!! Sure wish I had read how many megapix the Camara I Vaught had but other than that easy set up!! 
2912 an amazing camera!!! 
2913 Just as described. 
2914 I have seen better that cost less more and perform constantly better. 
2915 Works great 
2916 Awesome little camera. Thinking about getting some more. 
2917 it s kind of small for what I needed, but it s fine 
2918 Perfect fit for my Canon Power Shot. 
2919 It is a good camera....However very difficult to setup through your mobile phone or see on a PC not connected to your wifi. You have to be an expert geek to do that. 
2920 I only want to say that I just love this product .I am really impressed by this awesome product.thanks for this 
2921 Couldn t be happier with this seller. Everything as expected plus some. True customer service the way that shows the seller values and appreciate the buyer. Kudos! 
2922 Came with everything just like it said. In case your wondering, you can clip all of this to your phone. I had that concern myself. Thanks for the awesome product! :) 
2923 Fit perfectly! 
2924 Great product, esp. for beginners like myself. However it did not come with instructions on how to set up. 
2925 It s great having an extra battery for long trips and extended shooting and editing. 
2926 works great 
2927 Works like the original equipment 
2928 Great camera with lots of features great price, great pictures, great optics. 
2929 its great prodcut easy to install already comes programmed. Hands down best DIY product for any property owner / renter, 
2930 Bought this for my desk at work. It s terrible! It loops from the SD card to the generic pictures and then continues with the generic pictures. I have to turn on the SD card at least twice a day. Terrible! 
2931 The Adapter fullfilled my need well. I just did not expect the extra size &#34;adaptors&#34;. 
2932 Great battery charger for my Nikon Coolpix L830...no more frustrating dead battery worries! 
2933 Other than the fact that you have to buy a memory card separate we like it! I thought that would be included in the bundle, or even with just the camera, but it s not. The camera is great! 
2934 outstanding design for low cost (a very reasonable cost) work right out of the box. easy of setting it up. Best part is no monthly payment like Dropcam. Will buy several more. 
2935 Great products! 
2936 Worked great on our Disneyland trip. Fit right in the backpack, that way we didn t need to carry around the big camera case. 
2937 Does not fit well 
2938 Fantastic and it looks great too. 
2939 perfect price and a good piece 
2940 Good job! 
2941 Great product, very realistic and easy to install. Highly recommend. Good through all weathers also. Batteries been in 6 months and the light still blinks 
2942 GREAT POINT AND SHOOT CAMERA!! 
2943 ottima borsa 
2944 When it stays on, it works well. Doesn t always stay on. I would turn it on before heading out for a paintball game, then after game find out it was off...or showing a buffering symbol...or whatever. Performance seems inconsistent. 
2945 I own this system and the hard drive took a crap on me just right out of 1 year... The DVR is junk loads slow ect Cameras are not bad though. I upgraded to the newest system plan on using these cameras with my new ones 
2946 Have these batteries for quite a while now. They are still doing their job. 
2947 Works as advertised and fits Hero 4 Silver. 
2948 It works great 
2949 good enough 
2950 Very fun to play with! Getting some really cool photos. 
2951 works really well. 
2952 It was i was expecting. 
2953 Perfect item, as described in photo, very fast shipping, thank you I live it :0) 
2954 Great price and batteries seem to hold charge so far. 
2955 Good 
2956 Great service, delivered precisely as stated. Thanks. 
2957 Was absolutely everything I thought it would be. Works perfectly for all my video recording and photography needs 
2958 The part that was supposed to screw into the camera, was not threaded. 
2959 Just awesome... It s a great lens with high quality pictures and fast shutter speed I love it. Amazon surprised me with one day advance delivery ... 
2960 Excellent 
2961 Item was as described. Item was great quality. Delivered quickly. Would have rated it as a 5 star but was too tight for Canon 100-400mm Zoom Lens shade. Lens fits fine. 
2962 Great for the price 
2963 Will advise if it really works, but I like the protection 
2964 Great tripod, smooth movements, easy to set up. I like the locking features and the slide on and off detachable plate for easy camera attachment 
2965 Love this lens hood. 
2966 Not a good camera but does barely adequate video. 
2967 Quality... 
2968 Amazing lens, happy with outcome of product !!!! 
2969 What a great deal. The batteries are really why I bought this and they are effect the other accessories are ok 
2970 Pros: Well made, Good price Cons: Wrong size (5.5 x 2.1 mm not 4.0 x 1.7) 
2971 It s a pretty amazing value for the price. Very satisfied. Arrived much sooner than estimated. I would recommend to everyone. 
2972 this is the worst piece of garbage I ever bought from amazon...if I had the box I would return it in a minute..no wonder it was a big sale...video sucks 
2973 Good 
2974 Really Good Camera, Takes a few minutes to understand how to operate it (i didn t look in the manual) but overall its pretty easy and very light. Takes about 5-10 seconds to the image to Appear on film. 
2975 Works really well in my D300. 
2976 Great! 
2977 Good price and it does the job ! I love having my lens caps right where I need them ! 
2978 This lens hood was fine for a while, but started to tear and was not usable. Also, fully extended, the lens hood showed up in the pictures and had to be cropped out. 
2979 Excellente, simple product give nice result. 
2980 Awesome! Love it! 
2981 fits my camera nicely 
2982 Not bad...! 😁 
2983 Does just what it should. 
2984 Exceptionally well designed medium size camera bag at a reasonable price for a carrying: - camera attached to a 24-300mm lens with hood attached - lens and flash -second camera in top compartment 
2985 It was not for the battery model described above! 
2986 good product. a little hard to close (as these styles are) even with their very clear video, but i got it. The carrying case doesnt have a carrying strap, which would have been nice. 
2987 Gets job done! 
2988 Had to return - would not work wirelessly. Support spent 2 hours with me and ended up telling me to return. 
2989 Pretty good so far, I will see how it goes. 
2990 Excellent quality. CASE LOGIC sells very good products. I really appreciate having a camera case that can withstand rough treatment and protect my cameras and lenses. 
2991 received promptly..... it s now charged up and ready to use 
2992 Awesome! Just get a cheap 1TB USB drive and you are good-to-go! Works perfectly! 
2993 This works like magic! My wife loved it! 
2994 Perfect for the nikon j4, camera lens and accessories 
2995 Absolutely love it. Well made, too. 
2996 Best camera ever had. 
2997 Works well and reasonably priced. 
2998 Super product Excellent service. 
2999 Very nice pack for the price! I have used it heavily over the last couple of weeks. 
3000 fits, and looks good. missing a couple of holes for some openings that you might not need while using the camera. but to get to all the camera slots, you ll have to take the entire case off. makes this camera look like a really expensive good camera. 
3001 Works great and made of quality material. The only thing that I don t like it no identifying mark on the top. When you open the case and have loose items in the large hole they fall out. 
3002 only one of the two batteries actually works 
3003 Everything that is represented in this package came in perfect condition! 
3004 I received the battery quickly and was exactly as I expected. The price was very competitive. I had just bought a new camera and the camera battery was dead. I guess that the way it is, so I was surprised that this battery was fully charged. 
3005 Supports old browser versions (Chrome/IE latest version on Windows 7/8 didn t work) and operating systems (XP, maybe). Couldn t find mobile app either on Android app store. 
3006 The panasonic lens aproved by Blackmagic simply stopped focusing. it is blocked. Is the the problem in the Panansonic Lens or in the Camera ? 
3007 It worked as we have hoped- waterproof. You need to stay still a little longer when you take the picture..., the flash light takes a little longer than other cameras if you need it for picture taking. 
3008 as i coach i love this thing, only thing i do not like is that there is no display but I use my ipad for that. 
3009 A good little camera for the money. Still figuring out all the bells and whistles. Wanted it for baseball and football games. Truly can not go wrong with a Canon camera and this lives up to there reputation. 
3010 Easy to install,works as advertised,no false alarms but did alarm when a flock of doves flew through the beams. 
3011 Good product 
3012 good all around camera 
3013 Excellent 
3014 Wow! I really like this camera bag. I managed to fit a Canon 7D with battery pack, a speedlite, 70-210 and 28-80mm lenses and a few other miscellaneous items inside. 
3015 This is a great case! I love it, it s made my instax much more easily portable - i always have it around my neck :) 
3016 Good Battery. Thank you. 
3017 it s alright 
3018 Can t use my camera without this... 
3019 Good POUCH.... 
3020 Package arrived on time. Lens was in new condition with no defects. Works great. 
3021 Love this camera!!! It connects great to our iPhone and that feature has come in very handy!!!! 
3022 Awesome and quick delivery! 
3023 GREAT 
3024 Great lens, sharp and just what I was looking for. 
3025 Worked for one hour..then died. 
3026 This Drone isn t even a beginner drone. This drone is the worst I ve ever bought. Don t get fooled. Peace 
3027 Everything is pretty easy, except installing the micro SD card. You need to use the round end of a paper-clip to push the card all the way in until it locks. 
3028 Great price for a back up battery. They charged up like my original Canon and so far I am having good success with them. 
3029 it is light, stable and easy to use 
3030 Good product! 😊 
3031 thank you Henry Campbell 
3032 Excellent camera I love this camera I give it a 5 star 
3033 Great camera for everything I need it for 
3034 Great buy 
3035 Worked great with fast shipping. Did exactly what it was supposed to do. 
3036 Exactly what I was looking for 
3037 Excellent 
3038 Lots of room, and it fits behind our truck seat out of sight, lots of padding and protection. 
3039 Great deal, the only issue I have is there s a glare when you use it so it s very hard to see the screen when it s applied 😔 Other than that good product!! 
3040 I was thrilled to find a replacement for my old workhorse 880 
3041 And was surorised to also get a carry case, and charger. Now my Wide angle lens will not go to waste. 
3042 Really good! 
3043 So soft and comfortable on my neck. I ll have to order another with a different design. I love this. 
3044 Not easy to use. I have only been able to see the moon and across the lake where I live. Stars and planets are too hard to find and the auto finder has not yet found one. 
3045 Fast shipped with it but the product was not built for my Samsung Galaxy EK-GC200 as described. The alignment and holes not correct disappointed for sure 
3046 fits most 4x4 filters 
3047 Interchangeable with the original battery in my Panasonic camera. I always want a spare when traveling. Usually try to alternate them. 
3048 Fantastic! Very happy with sling. 
3049 First one had an issue with the HDMI port they made it right highly recommend 
3050 the camera is working very well. Reasonably easy to install (if you know what you are doing). 
3051 Exactly what I was looking for 
3052 good item 
3053 The plastic cracked while putting it on my iPhone5 the first try, so i had to return it. I did try a few shots and they weren t anything special. 
3054 prfect 
3055 Fits great. 
3056 Love this bag... Perfect size. 
3057 Great straps to carry a med-large tripod when in the field. More convenient than the regular case. 
3058 I like it and am enjoying it for the purpose I bought this for... I ll be back for more, it works amazingly well! 
3059 very easy to use. thankful for the item. Just as posted. 
3060 Very smooth and great value. Make sure you have the right base on your tripod so you get the correct size dolly. 
3061 Love these lights. I only wish it had come with assembly instructions. (We did figure it out, eventually). 
3062 works great. 
3063 This product is just what I wanted for my camera , it comes very handy and versatile. 
3064 Video image is worse I ve seen. Blurr and out of Focuss. Really felt cheated. 
3065 Works well, the only problem is seeing the wording on the screen, have to use a small flashlight, that stops me from giving it the fifth star... 
3066 Fantastic!!!.. 
3067 I received it much faster than I expected and it works better than the original. 
3068 I like this EP, bright and wide viewing field. Edge to edge sharpness is not perfect however, it s about 70~80% sharp from center. 
3069 Works fine 
3070 Great light, very portable. Love the ability to dim the light also. 
3071 Love this camera. Support was also very helpful when it wouldn t connect to my WiFi. Not connecting was it s only issue. Now works perfectly. 
3072 This strap was more comfortable to wear with the binoculars I bought. 
3073 Great Battery ... So far it perform as good as the original ... highly recommended 
3074 excellent! 
3075 Image is ok Smartphone works ok Cannot upgrade firmware Image don t show at PC software No website information 
3076 Quickly delivery. Brought mainly for the chest mount and head mount which I m very happy with both work well. All other accessories seem pretty decent, will have to use at some point. 
3077 5+++ great people to deal with 
3078 This thing is amazing!! Quality is spot on, you can t beat this thing at the price point or even higher. Get yourself one you won t regret it!! 
3079 It fits my gopro hero 3 just fine. I bought it so I can use the gopro without a battery and house power connected to it when I use it as baby monitor. 
3080 It s okay. Not a great product 
3081 Has some good wind power for cleaning your optics - lenses, camera sensors, inside computers. Nice and simple - no supplies needed. 
3082 It works, before it breaks. After a few years, now all of the plastic pieces on this monopod are broken. For what reason should I ever buy Manfrotto again? 
3083 Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to. 
3084 Great camera! I have not owned many cameras but this one will last me a very long time. Once I can start getting new lenses I will love it even more. Definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a unique but powerful camera. 
3085 Works great on my camera. 
3086 nice 
3087 Perfect fit for my camera and its charger and a few SD cards. 
3088 very good 
3089 Great product 
3090 Stain on filter when it came. The MagicFiber cloth turns out very useful to remove it. I guess the filter is good for its price, but definitely not using it &#34;full time&#34; due to the visible reflections and lens flare in many situations. 
3091 So far the Yongnuo YN-622N controller and transceivers working flawlessly on both a Nikon D610 and D810. 
3092 no issues. I love this camera. it works for me as advertised. 
3093 Great camera. Very suitable for my needs and takes great pictures. 
3094 Bought this for my Husband and he loved it! Very nice product and a really quick delivery. Would definitely buy from thus company again! 
3095 It is OK for a quick camera 
3096 Very impressed. Easy to use. Like that it s not Bluetooth. Don t have to worry about being charged! 
3097 Ok 
3098 Awesome product 
3099 Danny was great, he fixed everything and was very nice! Good product!! 
3100 Works great. We use these to monitor our pets when we re away. 
3101 It s great but I bought the prime day bundle so not all accesories fits on it so not perfect for my purchase. 
3102 The eyepieces are good quality. iTs a nice set. BUT THE CASE THAT YOU GET IS NOT THE ONE DISPLAYED. You get a black case instead of the brushed aluminum. AMAZON, PLEASE SHOW THE CORRECT CASE!!!!!! 
3103 Nice item, well made. 
3104 My most used lens, especially for HDR photography. I keep forgetting to turn off the image stabilizer when done shooting. See my work on Panoramio. 
3105 Delivered on time and as per description 
3106 very good product. excellent quality 
3107 I am very pleased with this product. I have a Nikon D3300 and it works beautifully with it. 
3108 excellent frame. 
3109 Hard to focus does not take good close up pictures or wide angle seems off but at full telephoto it is better than average 
3110 The edges of the material started to fray after two months. 
3111 Never have to worry about a dead battery. Speedy delivery 
3112 Batteries work as described. Great price on these. 
3113 didn t zoom in on gopro 
3114 Solid, awesome Pelican case as are all the Pelican cases I own! 
3115 great grip. 
3116 Love it. Great pics and no lens moving in and out. 
3117 Just as advertised. Great lens protectors. 
3118 Protection plans are stupid in general 
3119 Great little bag, holds a lot and its well made. 
3120 I like it 
3121 Battery was as expected.. Working great 
3122 No Problems here. Seems to be a good product. 
3123 I would give it a 5 stars if not for the fact that I have to have a tools in order to use it properly. I mean, the D part of the screw (the part we handle) is too small to twist. Other than that, the product is good. 
3124 Works great, no problems can have fresh battery handy when shooting a lot of photos. 
3125 Takes such amazing photos!!! (but i have not been able to find a B&W setting...) 
3126 great 
3127 Worked great 
3128 No problems 
3129 It works but is a little &#34;twitchy&#34; in that it doesn t always want to work properly. 
3130 If you buy a Canon Vixia HF R600, you will not run out of battery with this purchase. A definite must buy. 
3131 Works perfectly! 
3132 Nice and neat for my go pro 
3133 It works perfect. 
3134 LOVE this purchase. I ve used it for multi 5ks, bike rides with the family, basically any experience I want to capture POV - to many to list. Sturdy product, not to heavy or clunky. Thumbs up!! 
3135 It works ! 
3136 Works well, no problems with the mounting brackets or anything. Does get uncomfortable after a little while, but if you re wearing anything more than a t-shirt you do not feel it. Enjoy the flexibility in size. 
3137 Seems to be holding up in water tests (without the camera in it). Does as advertised so far. 
3138 Great lens. I love it! 
3139 Strong clips for the price! 
3140 Better and cheaper than go pro! 
3141 good...... 
3142 Exactly what I needed. 
3143 Awesome 
3144 Work as described 
3145 Very compact and easy to use. These have enhanced many shots for me! Was a little puzzling how to twist them back into the carrying case, but once I figured it out, it is VERY SIMPLE! 
3146 Great value for the price 
3147 Well made. 
3148 Sound quality isn t the best and the battery only lasts for a couple hours, but they are still amazing to have 
3149 Great productos good quality and fits my camera perfectly. 
3150 it was fine 
3151 really surprising 
3152 I have a canon SL1 and works great; easy to use. 
3153 Easy to install and use for magnifying the surface of objects. Good magnification. Excellent value for the price. 
3154 I really like this. It s really cute. 
3155 Excellent! 
3156 Took a spill with my Inspire 1 and tore this cable. This is a perfect replacement. 
3157 Quick delivery- part was right 
3158 This case is awesome. Love it. Works great with my camera. Worth the money 
3159 excellent quality, and after 6 months it works perfectly 
3160 All OK.. 
3161 Pretty average camera, but it works 
3162 I can t say whether the battery life is as long as the factory GoPro batteries, as I haven t done a side by side test. But I ve used these batteries in the camera and so far so good. 
3163 Perfect works great !! 
3164 Works perfect for my camera 
3165 Excellent lens for long distance, fully manual lens, 
3166 Awesome deal, thanks 
3167 Purchased this for a Tokina 11-16mm f/2.8. It s always better to break a 10$ piece of glass than it is to break a 500$ lens. Buy this for your lens. 
3168 Very good! 
3169 Great lens. Works great for family photos and photoshoots. 
3170 Worked great for the first couple of times, then it just stopped workin, only works when I have it charges 
3171 Great camera. Shoots great video. Highly recommended 
3172 Great product, really impressive customer service! 
3173 No issues so far. Haven t used it much yet. 
3174 Works well 
3175 They re nice but they re slightly bigger than the Instax Mini 8 films. 
3176 Cannot get them to work. Only works with Outdated web Browser 
3177 Worked fine for the camera, but figuring out how to attach it with the straps needs instructions. 
3178 Item as described, great product. 
3179 Husband has set it up in his car and kept himself busy for hours with this thing. As long as he s playing with the camera and the car, he s not buggin me! 
3180 Bought it for working on micro soldering, its ok but one axis is reversed without special software. Kids love to play with it and check out all kinds of stuff. 
3181 Good quality, very useful, practical and stylish camera backpack! 
3182 Awesome camera...video is clear, easy setup. I have 2, and I would definitely recommend. 
3183 Sturdy and VERY LIGHT! 
3184 It is not what I expected, I was hoping it was made of a stronger material. 
3185 Sucks....Can t see clearly at night and it also overheats the camera. FAIL 
3186 GOOD COMMERCIAL APPLICATION 
3187 Excellent quality 
3188 Wish I would have gotten one that can take photos with a button at the stem 
3189 Just what I was looking for. Is worth the 4 stars. Super quality also. Just as stated. As good if not better then items that cost more. Well worth the money. Have no real con s at this time and do not dee any in the future. 
3190 Great for crafts, the photos can come out darker but overall love this tiny printer. 
3191 Wonderful for the price 
3192 Had a client inadvertently run cat5e instead of siamese cable. These saved us from having to spend two days re-running cables 70 in the air across the top of a factory floor. Works perfect! 
3193 The pictures all look hazy blue. What I was seeing was more colorful than the pictures. Sending back 
3194 Came with everything I needed. As a professional, I appreciate the quick delivery and excellent care in wrapping. Worked great right out of the box. 
3195 fast deliver and good product 
3196 Returned because Fuji S4800 failed.. 
3197 Quality of leather was below my expectation. 
3198 Alright for walking, but not jarring action. 
3199 I ve had this case for at least 8 years and I ve used it in many different countries. My deepest dive with it was 125 ft and its never leaked. The buttons are easy to use and you get great pic s 
3200 Nice photo frame, works well. Clear picture. Easy to use. 
3201 i like it, but the carrying case is not the one in the picture. 
3202 Best Polaroid film I ve bought in 3 years! I buy it every year for the first day of school photos to use all year...thank you, you took very good care of the film...Janet 
3203 Fits perfectly 
3204 Excellent shipping 8ng and item 
3205 The best glasses cleaners i have ever had. While each cloth is small, the results after use are excellent. A true first class product, i will definatly be ordering more. 
3206 Great deal, batteries and charger work well with my cannon. 
3207 These are great battery. They last longer than I expected, and they stay cool and not heat up as my previous one. 
3208 works well, and very good advice 
3209 Does what it says it will. 
3210 a very fine and honest dealer 
3211 Disappointed no memory card included 
3212 These stick on great I just use my hand to get the dirt off. These are easy to use and are cheaper than any other options. Even if I m not AIing a cow I use them to see when my bull is breeding. 
3213 A-OK 
3214 as advertised 
3215 I bought this product and till now I could not use it because it didn t work, I contact the support and they were unhelpful I m using it right know as a mouse pad 
3216 Wifi switch broke after a few days. Great camera and water proof case. 
3217 Doesn t quite work, stick withy thame original 
3218 Perfect for my tiny Canon camera and charger. 
3219 Excellent value! Polarizing lens makes outstanding pictures of glaciers and waterfalls! 
3220 Was not as expected! Returned! 
3221 leave the blinking LED off. real camera s do not blink. 
3222 Used it for a trip to Europe. Was perfect for what I needed. Compact but plenty of storage. Camera with lens, plus two additional lenses, accessories and an ipad. All fit perfectly. 
3223 Good camera 
3224 Just started my online business and the product MS20 is helping me achieve great images. Very simple and easy to build and use. 
3225 Although I haven t graduated off &#34;Auto&#34; on my K-50, I took some pics through the window of a moving automobile, and they came out Postcard Perfect! Unbelievable--I am impressed! 
3226 Great addition to my everyday out and about photo bag. 
3227 OEM and perfect. Obviously there are cheaper but I m a stickler for consistency. 8-) 
3228 Great starter kit though I wish there was longer battery life 
3229 This OEM battery holder seems very sturdy as it has more metal than the cheaper variety. This holder is worth the money but I would not discount the cheaper ones. I also have one but feel that its life-span would not be as long since it is practically all plastic. 
3230 Piece of crap instructions confusing no help never got it to work sim card still stuck in it a waste of my time and money. 
3231 Work well with connection being tight and secure. Female end a little big hard to hide but with a little finagling all is good 
3232 Perfect design: Absolute functional and gorgeous. Perfect handcraft: Every details are fully considered and covered. The little base might look easy and simple but it involves a lot works and focus. Perfect service: Quick delivery,peace of mind after-sale service! J.B.Camera Designs add extra rejoicing on my photograph! Well done! 
3233 It s been almost 2.5 years since I bought this strap and it was a great purchase. It s nicely padded and I love the versatility the clip system allows for. A comfy strap is a must for using heavy glass 
3234 Save time and frustration...get the original Samsung Battery as a back up. Mine did not hold a full charge...even when charged overnight. Thought I could save a few bucks. Promptly returned for the real thing. 
3235 I works well with Canon 5Dii and plus, the three batteries it uses are AAA and are easily available. 
3236 good 
3237 it does everything i want and is very compact 
3238 Camera is great! Some of the extras have limited use. 
3239 Drone worked great, but had a problem with the camera. Various lines and snow. Otherwise no problems. 
3240 My old camera case is better than this one. 
3241 Love it. 
3242 I love this frame. I have purchased three over the years. Size is nice. And it has been a great gift for my family...I can easily send the grandparents pictures of the family and it will automatically upload to their frame. 
3243 Flimsy and detaches from frame easily. 
3244 Really nice for the money.... 
3245 Great product, alarm up and working again 
3246 Cheaply made. works good 
3247 Plastic snapped off, weak for larger phones, I have an LG G3 
3248 As advertised 
3249 Works perfect 
3250 Great item 
3251 Excelente 
3252 Awful Shoulder strap. Every time you raise the camera quickly, the strap gets tangled in the D ring. This makes the product useless as it prevents a quick draw. Bought a Cotton Carrier and never looked back. 
3253 This camera is simply amazing. I just returned from a week in Cozumel where I took over 800 UW pics with the camera at depths ranging from surface to 105 feet. The pictures are amazing. I highly recommend this camera. 
3254 It doesn t have a motion sensor as it said so it is useless for what I needed it for. Otherwise it s fun to play with. 
3255 excellent 
3256 It works but just not great I the they hyped the product a little much 
3257 Easy to install. I had one camera stop working after 6 months. 
3258 This product is worth the extra money 
3259 worked as advertised 
3260 Great Product! 
3261 I love this camera and enjoy taking pictures with it. 
3262 Great batteries, lasts over an hour with wifi remote on. 
3263 Don t go in the water without it. 
3264 good condition & great price 
3265 Excellent product. 
3266 What a great deal! Got everything I needed for my camera & more! Had no issues whatsoever! Highly recommended! 
3267 Good solid fit. Protects the camera well. It is a little bulky to hang on my belt. I can fit exta battery and SD cards in the front pocket. 
3268 not bad, good protection 
3269 Thank you John, for being so helpful in setting up my camera. I m not very camera smart, but this was the easiest setup I could ever imagine. I highly recommend FOSCAM F18919W, and there team support, especially John. Thank you once again. 
3270 Light and sturdy tripod works wonders when you are traveling or hiking with itit. This is one of those tripods. This product is well worth the money. My brother bought it. 
3271 Works great programmed into my Veralite system. I am very happy. 
3272 Works excellent, good quality 
3273 Unfortunately, I couldn t get it to work :( 
3274 too small 
3275 Arrived earlier than expected. Cannot wait to use it :3 
3276 Great camera pic up several for family and friends. 
3277 Works well on its own; bought it to add to my Staples Connect system which it does however audio is not currently supported via Connect. Product has a fairly good image compared to my multiple FOSCAMs. 
3278 Works perfectly and the charge lasts longer than expected. 
3279 Work really well but do not hold a charge as long as the Canon batteries. but, well worth the price. 
3280 sent back. the eye doc gives bigger cloths than these/The size of a postage stamp!!! 
3281 Very good with this price. 
3282 good price and product. 
3283 Amazing 
3284 Bought this back in 2013 but thought I d still do a review: I use this bag for my Samsung NX1000 and it fits everything. Very spacious and easy to carry and like that it has lots of pockets. 
3285 The brush quality and the size of the blower was bigger than I expected it to be. I ordered the version with the Altura lens cleaner included. I used it on a really filthy telescope eyepiece (with multi-coatings) to no obvious ill effect, so that s good. 
3286 Replacement lens works great, and fits like a glove! 
3287 Nice pouch. Filters fit snugly and padding was good. Folds nicely. 
3288 Lens captures nice crisp shots. Takes the place of original D40 lens and separate 200mm lens. 
3289 Great - just as described & prompt delivery. 
3290 It s a very wide lens for a cctv camera. It s the widest I ve purchased thus far. Picture quality isn t great but it is acceptable. I can see my entire living room which we never thought would be possible with one camera. 
3291 Works 
3292 Works great. Would buy again. 
3293 great deal on a great camera. arrived promptly. 
3294 Wonderfull battery 
3295 This light is bright and a great value! 
3296 It s not so great for outdoors :( I hate it. 
3297 Works great for kids toys that need batteries. Great price! 
3298 Great picture. Touch screen has not panned out yet, but still worth the buy for my CCTV. 
3299 Piece of junk, its the right plug but it won t go into my camera 
3300 Very well built. Straight and solid. A bit heavy, but that s the advantage, it s a solid foundation for multiple cameras. 
3301 basic follow focus, 4 stars as i knew it wasn t going to be great, so as a cheap easy one, sure its a great one. if you want perfect smooth no feeling of the gears when turning, buy a better quality one. 
3302 This comes with all the hardware. it works for distance and close up photography. My only problem is that I haven t found a recharble battery for the flash. 
3303 Works great, just like all other GoPro products. Would have liked more curved mounts for helmets. This package includes 3 curved and 3 flat. Would like to be able to purchase all curved or all flat. 
3304 Purchased this kit, because I lost my other charger and battery. And this one did the job to keep me using my Olympus digital camera. 
3305 Good quality product! 
3306 Excellent lightweight tripod 
3307 Good and solid quality but too big for my small EOS Rebel SL1. Not an appropriate size for people to carry, in my opinion. 
3308 these work great on my husbands camera lenses. very compact! 
3309 Great value for a great product. I bought this as a gift for my wife and was pleasantly surprised by the performance, especially for the price. 
3310 Arrived on time and works as advertised. No problems. A good replacement hood and lens cap for video cameras. A little overpriced. But good. 
3311 I have no idea how this will perform over the long run, hence the four stars, but for now it s performing flawlessly. 
3312 They work very well but the seT up is confusing. I still am having trouble understanding the logging and replay of the history you need to be a very savvy tech person and a couple of hrs to set it up. 
3313 An improved version of the Plume Wafer w/o the cost. I have 2 of them. Great construction! The reflective surface near the center of my Plume came apart after years of use. This looks like it will last a lot longer. 
3314 Great to start with!! Controls are easy to figure and handle!! Unit is durable but lightweight so wind is an issue 
3315 System works great. Dollar for dollar very good value. 
3316 Showed up on time, works exactly as advertised. Also came with a car-charger cable, which is an added bonus. 
3317 good value quick delivery 
3318 Fits my camera perfectly! Love this case! I use it all the time. The material is soft to the touch. I don t use the strap it came with as I wanted a &#34;prettier&#34; one. 
3319 the best I ve ever had. no wires. can go as far as 10 feet. 
3320 LOve it 
3321 Absolutely entirely what I was looking for! 
3322 Exactly what I was looking for 
3323 I lost my original case that came with my Canon camera 
3324 This one was an exact replacement, and i love it. The quality is excellent. 
3325 Lightweight, no binding or slipping, holds tightly to all my filters and lenses. Would be nice if the edge were knurled, hence four stars. 
3326 Very disappointed. 
3327 These Camera s are awesome! Can t tell that they re fake!! 
3328 Awesome lens for the a6000! You would NOT regret buying this lens. NO lens creep, plenty bright in most situations and a great WIDE focal range! 
3329 Great! 
3330 I haven t turned it off since I got it! I think it can do way more than I needed but am very happy I purchased it! 
3331 Great 
3332 seem to work 
3333 Pros: - 75-300mm telephoto zoom lens with f/4-5.6 maximum aperture for Canon SLR cameras - Improved mechanism makes zooming smoother; front part of zoom ring sports silver ring - Measures 2.8 inches in diameter and 4.8 inches long; weighs 16.8 ounces 
3334 Great!! My daughter absolutely loves it!! 
3335 Work and fit just as well as the original. 
3336 Its hard to go wrong with a sling strap and this was a far better deal than the straps at my local stores, it works great and its my favorite strap now 
3337 Not what i expected. 
3338 Outstanding. Works great on my Meade LX200GPS 12&#34; telescope. Good construction, I hope. 
3339 Item as described 
3340 Hood needs to fix. 
3341 kenneth. Took a while with the plugin issues but Kenneth stayed with it until the problem was solved. 
3342 Too tight 
3343 now my husband can capture everything on his GoPro. EVERYTHING. great.... 
3344 No manual to explain things so I had to figure it out by myself, but the grip works well and I really appreciate all of the features. 
3345 does not compatible with 5DS-R. 
3346 Good camera for the price. 
3347 Work great and a good price. 
3348 Great size for a body with attached lens, a second lens, flash and spare battery. I even made a little slot to carry my extra CF cards. 
3349 Very nice!! 
3350 The camera works as advertised. It it works seamlessly with Apple s forthcoming Apple TV/HomeKit system, I will purchase a lot more of them. 
3351 This camera is easy to use. This is my second one I purchased because my husband liked mine so much he wanted his own 
3352 Great for my Nikon D-90. Good low light. Light weight. If you don t mind zooming with your feet. 
3353 Great deal. charger works well and batteries hold a charge like the original gopro batteries. Awesome price! 
3354 Good stuff! 
3355 Works great. I have a Nikon D300 that uses CF. My mac easily takes SD. So, this is a good and easy way to take photos and transfer them to mac (and most other devices). No issues so far. 
3356 Fast shipping & great price - just wish it wasn t so pricey & hard to get them developed when done ! 
3357 For the price it has met my expectations. Been using it an all works good. Video quality is high and the pictures come out good also. So far so good, no complaints! 
3358 great 
3359 Not an actual Nikon product, the rubber was not the same material as the original and if fell apart while removing it from the package. Shipped from China, surprisingly fast but it s junk. Hardly any glue holding the rubber eye piece to the plastic &#34;frame&#34;. 
3360 Foggy picture. 
3361 Great piece of plastic, it s worth it. I ve gotten plenty of reat shots with this lens 
3362 Love it so far... would be nice to have a packing slip in the box. 
3363 My batteries fried in it.. used it once and battery acid went every where. Thought maybe it was bad batteries but then it happened with the next ones i put in too 
3364 Great thing 
3365 My son uses it for his mountain bike races. Works great. 
3366 Excellent quality cable. They were exactly as described and arrived as schedules. Excellent experience. 
3367 Great device! easy to use. 
3368 works as expected 
3369 Very quick service and exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!! 
3370 Easy to configure, two way audio not very good, motion detection not good excellent for the price. 
3371 Works as advertised. Now you don t have to set up the camera with the self-timer and try to run to get in the picture. Just point this little device at your Nikon, and trip the shutter from afar. 
3372 Its a very neat product. Its strong enough to hold the smartphone. As Bluetooth unit is an independent piece, it helps to click from the hand which is not holding the stick and thus avoiding any shaking of the stick. 
3373 I m so pleased with the product and the speedily delivery! Great doing business with, I highly recommend! 
3374 Sturdy and Stead 
3375 Great product 
3376 Great little tripod that is surprisingly sturdy for the size and price. Folds up nicely into a little carrier. Recommend. 
3377 A very useful add-on for the stabilizer. You can easily get amazing angles with high and low. The length is very easy to adjust. And even if you don t need an extension, the added length helps keep the entire setup smoother. 
3378 Got it on time for my niece birthday she love some how I thought that the film came with the camera cause in the picture the film is next to the camera but it did not sad but true but still I will give it a 5 star 
3379 It works very good to take pictures and video 
3380 very helpful- handy 
3381 After getting the SD Card that it didn t come with, the picture quality was total crap. worthless 
3382 I wish it didn t have the pre-cut slots for things to go. You could fit a lot more if it was like a rifle case. 
3383 Fit and worked great. The price fit perfectly as well! 
3384 Great charger, great battery s, specially for the price!! 
3385 Sweeeeeeet 
3386 Wow, easy set up. Got here on time with no damages. And I ll be ordering another for next year as a 2nd set-up. I highly recommend this product. 
3387 Pretty decent package overall, everything worked and definitely exceeded expectations. As a photo student this is perfect for what I need as well as my career! 
3388 Excellent !! 
3389 Its really good 
3390 Great set I love it 
3391 This was a great buy with many accessories included. They all work well with our gopro hero silver. 
3392 This broke within days of using it. 
3393 Does not fit the camera 
3394 I actually bought this as a gift for my three year old. Only down side is it does not make the shuter sound when you take a photo, so it is difficult to tell if your photo actually took 
3395 These batteries work great in my Canon camera and charge quickly. They were priced much lower than any of the other batteries. 
3396 They re perfect and a lot less that Canon 
3397 it s a good system. However, I wish it wasn t complicated to connect to your wireless device such as download Skype set up two different Skype accounts in order to view live on your wireless devices 
3398 Bag was a perfect fit for my G11 camera. Also has an extra slot inside to put things like extra memory cards or driver license and credit cards for easy travel. 
3399 For the price, these things exceeded my expectations. Highly recommend for either day or night 
3400 Coke bottle optics 
3401 the battery does not fit in exactly as this is for multiple types of batteries. Consequently, my grandchild who uses it becomes frustrated at times. 
3402 Excellent purchase! 
3403 Works perfectly! Better than the OEM one. 
3404 Nice size for easy use. Much better than those you get with your average cleaning kit s which tend to be too small and make it easy to smudge what you just cleaned. 
3405 Great product! I love mine. 
3406 The adapter did physically join my EOS camera to a manual film lens but the focal point was way too short to be of any use to anyone. 
3407 Very disappointed that it did not have belt loop to allow it to be carried on my pants belt. It is simply a cover. 
3408 The service was very good, but the glasses doesn t work. 
3409 Great product. Easy to use and took great pictures. 
3410 Its the best rig , for only 40$ you have a excellent rig with some funtions 
3411 Awesome product for the price. Sturdy and reliable. Recommend this product! 
3412 Great!!! 
3413 Definitely recommend for the price!! Can t beat it! 
3414 Don t substitute and buy off-brand batteries. Go with the real deal. They fit the camera and work as advertised. 
3415 Works great. No issues 
3416 Have had camera for a while.. Changed router and couldn t connect WI-Fi. Called service and they had me up and running in a few minutes. Kudos to service dept. Love camera. 
3417 Great price and product. 
3418 thank you 
3419 Works better then the original 
3420 Had to replace a couple of rivets as they broke off. Otherwise a nice genuine goat leather bag for my camera equipment. 
3421 I ADORE this strap. I did a ton of research, as a photography college student I was getting so sore after a day of shooting. This strap has made a huge difference, I don t have a sore shoulder anymore and I feel it distributes the weight well. 
3422 No records goes to the battery being charged, it has given me too many problems 
3423 As good as the brand name battery at 1/5 the cost!! 
3424 Good battery!!!!! 
3425 not very good qaulity and i have great internet speed in my home. im a systems admin so no problem setting up. terrible camera all around 
3426 Products were as described 
3427 works perfectly 
3428 Keeps my camera and equipment safe and well packed. Great buy. 
3429 Good 
3430 For the price, eh. I d spend that much on a good coffee, but the quality just sucks. It &#34;works&#34; but the instructions are inaccurate, the thing has to be reset all the time and the image quality is terrible. If you want one of these, spend a little more. 
3431 Saved my phone from sinking to the bottom of the river when tubing. One of the smartest purchases I ever made! 
3432 It came with some defects.. the housing that is covering the transformer it took off and I had to use adhesive to attach it again.. 
3433 Good product 
3434 Excellent binoculars. Everyone in the family enjoyed them. 
3435 Really nice camera, 24 MP sensor lots of excellent features, particularly like the articulating screen. If you don t have antique lenses, it ll work fine for you. 
3436 I was quite disappointed; when the kit arrived the original package was opened, both brushes and cleaning liquid missing. The paper and micro fiber cleaning pad dirty and torn, in a state that I would not recommend using it on a optical devices. 
3437 Good product 
3438 So easy to use! Great inexpensive flash. 
3439 Nothing like the OEM product for the Canon gear. Price is the worst, but seems to recharge better and last longer then the 3rd party batteries 
3440 Awesome HD CCTV video, yeah HD, and you can watch from anywhere on your phone. 
3441 Great Product!!! fast Shipping!! 
3442 totally loved it...works beyond what I expected...great buy...worth it... 
3443 Excellent product - works great 
3444 Nikon is best and this filter too. 
3445 Great lens, love that I can get in close, but has a hard time focusing. I m thinking of selling it because I don t use it that much for weddings. 
3446 Every thing I expected at a very good price. Easy to read and understand instruction manual. 
3447 Nice pair of batteries. 
3448 Very good ty 
3449 Exactly what i needed. Thanks! 
3450 Good 
3451 I am very happy with the product. It serve its purpose quite well: I use it at home for guests, since it is not something very handy to carry around in trips. :-) 
3452 It only worked for 3 days. 
3453 Not really the shutter button didn t work. 
3454 I was not happy with the camera. Quality is so so. I am returning it and purchased the printer to work with my smartphone. 
3455 a gift for my grandson in college and he was pleased. He is studying film. 
3456 While I don t use either the blue or the yellow, the white one works great when you don t want to haul around off-camera lighting or you want to be more discreet than a big soft box. Easier than making your own or holding up a piece of paper. 
3457 This camera one of the best in the market , I will give 10 stars if I have money I will buy another one ,this some pictures I took from iPhone to show how nice is the control panel, 
3458 It s a light weight tripod and easy to set up. I wish the swiveling was smoother though. Good for taking pictures, not as good for taking video that is action oriented. 
3459 Feels very solid, but has a nice light weight to it. Works smoothly with the right weight balancing it. Really love this jib, I ll be using this a lot in my work. 
3460 Why do I keep losing these things? Not sure, but this is a great replacement. 
3461 no information came no direction just the syma came 
3462 Just what I needed. Thanks. 
3463 works well 
3464 Leaked. Resolution was OK but not great before that, now its full of water.... 
3465 Just love the bag - had to pruchase both colors! 
3466 All sorts of cheap plastic crap for your gopro. 
3467 I am really happy with this product. Easy to use easy to install. And works as advertised 
3468 Batteries seems to be made in china,but it works great. Best deal possible for the amount of money spent! 
3469 The price is very reasonable 
3470 love it 
3471 Excellent 
3472 Great Product will buy again. 
3473 Great gift 
3474 I either lost or never had a charger for this camera. It worked perfectly 
3475 At times it does look a a bit cheap, but it has the style I was going for and has proven relaible 
3476 You get a lot for the money with this camera. I ordered it for the price/quality/features. The features are very impressive at this price point. 
3477 Worked great for my Nikon battery that I can t find the charger for, and the replacement batteries work perfectly in the camera. 
3478 Camera came/delivered two days after I ordered it (the day between ordering and delivery was a Sunday too!) in great condition. Instructions came in English and several other languages, along with helpful pictures to show how to operate the camera without much reading required. 
3479 seems to work alright 
3480 Great product. Uses very low current. Very easy to install. Just connect to the siren terminals.sound is loud enough and strobe is OK but not like a Police cruiser. 
3481 all that i want 
3482 Excellent 
3483 Great service and prompt delivery! Thanks a bunch!! A+ 
3484 Great camera! 
3485 Great product. Lightning aquick shipment. 
3486 I see you!!! Now 
3487 get the heck outta here before I call the police 
3488 it works 
3489 love it ! 
3490 These are really nice little connectors at a very good price! 
3491 It is light and cute I just hope they had different fabrics 
3492 Great low cost alternative some of the much more expensive shutter releases. I ve put this through its paces. It s held up well and has helped me shoot some of my best long exposure b 
3493 exactly as described, works perfectly, well machined and fits my tripod quick release plate. note: you can t tighten with allen key, either by hand or a coin. 
3494 Everything showed up in one shipment exactly as advertised. Very happy with my purchase and choice of retailer. 
3495 It makes viewing the night sky easygoing! Constellations are now easy to find and view. 
3496 didn t last very long :( 
3497 good 
3498 the flash lamp broke down after 3 days of use 
3499 Very light and easy to carry! good looking! 
3500 They re perfect for my glasses, iPad, and iPhone! It s nice to know that I can scatter these throughout my home and always have one available. Thank you 
3501 Works as advertised. Good product. My use is a high gain long distance receiver for my RV, and it works great. 
3502 Nice gels, but took a long time to get here (Chicago area). 
3503 This is crap. It was really hard to seat on my 5D Mark III and not accurate according to two other levels I tested it against. Is it possible to give this zero stars? 
3504 Very good 
3505 good. 
3506 Nice camera,easy to use,easy to carry 
3507 Haven t used it much but so far its really good. Need to practice more w/ it. 
3508 It was adverticed 
3509 awesome love it 
3510 Very fast shipping. Holds my camera and all lenses. 
3511 Worked fine. VHS C cassette fit and ran as expected in the VCR. Fast delivery. 
3512 a bit cheaply made, but it pretty much does the job, especially for the price. 
3513 Great beginner set-up. 
3514 The Pixel Vertax D15 battery grip for Nikon D7100 works well on D7200. It s to bad u can t put 2 batteries in the grip like the grip for my old D90 s 
3515 It sort of did the job but it was hardly the easiest, clearest product on the market. 
3516 I recommend, fast delivery. very good 
3517 Camera had good image quality compared for its price. Promised 60fps was not achieved on 720p resolution but apr. 48-50fps but it is still better than 30fps from ordinary webcams. Well worth its price. 
3518 Pretty cool softbox, look forward to using them shortly 
3519 This camera does not take very good pictures but it s not an expensive camera either. Pictures are grainy and the further away you are from the subject the more grainy they are. 
3520 Inexpensive and sounds great!!!!! 
3521 Good 
3522 excellent design 
3523 Solid case for air-travel with any kind of tools! Sturdy & Rugged! 
3524 important to protect the lens. 
3525 awful camera, doesn t include everything you need as well as just an awful camera I would highly recommend not buying it 
3526 It s ok in a pinch if you didn t have lens cleaner and tissue, however, it still leaves some residual smudges. If I had both, my preference would be the cleaner and tissue. 
3527 Fine 
3528 great 
3529 This is great. Out met my expectations. Delivery was on time. Would definitely buy from them again. 
3530 works great, good buy for the money 
3531 Very poor quality. Pictures are dark, sometimes scrambled, and strange signs are sometimes shown instead of pictures. I’ve always had good luck with Amazon, but these frames are definitely not as advertised. 
3532 Excellente Stick. Nothing else to say. EXCELLENT 
3533 Good dog watcher. May buy more 
3534 Great cameras and used daily! 
3535 Bought with the secondary battery unit, all works well! 
3536 Has held up well over the last few months, plenty of room, zippers work well. Good padding and several zippered pockets. Well made! 
3537 Perfect fit for fuji xt1 
3538 This was given to my daughter as a Christmas gift and she likes it very much. 
3539 I bought a camera second hand and the strap was missing. I ordered this as I like to carry a camera and don t want to keep fishing it out of a pocket or purse. The main strap is very comfortable and doesn t dig in to my wrist. 
3540 Iam glad to get the battery thanks 
3541 Very decent camera for what I needed to view. Also the price is great. I had to purchase an extra 150ft bnc cable for it to reach its location. Works great at night. Great buy. Bought 8 and all came ready to install! 
3542 This was a birthday gift for my wife. Her Nikon D7100 fits in here along with her 24-70mm lens and her primary lens. Great for carrying her camera and tablet and other stuff. She loves it! This is a keeper. 
3543 Excellent. I bought this for a Panasonic Lumix FT6, and its much slimmer than apparently all the alternatives. Floats well and doesn t look like a lift jacket on my wrist. 
3544 great flash 
3545 Excellent filter. I got amazing pictures. 
3546 Great!! I love it 
3547 great 
3548 Good camera, great zoom. The USB connector is hard to use and seems prone to breakage. External charger recommended - connecting camera to wall electrical outlet using the connector in the camera is not convenient at all. 
3549 Great product. Setup was simple. Works as advertised with no problems. I would buy this again. 
3550 very compact, great quality. would buy again! 
3551 works well 
3552 worked grate for what i was using it for. 
3553 I was nervous but pleasantly surprised. Very nice case and fits all my Phantom 3 components perfectly. I usually never leave feedback either. Good purchase 
3554 Zero stars if I could. This item doesnt work to charge your camera. Dont buy it! Waste of time and money. 
3555 used very well 
3556 Bought these to clean fingerprints off the screens of our tablets and they work great. 
3557 Met expectations. 
3558 This product is just what I needed to comfortably carry my camera and equipment in. I especially like the side pocket for storing a mini tripod. Everything that I currently use fits inside and it is still light weight and easy to manage. 
3559 another one bites the dust after I took it in the water 100 buck down 
3560 camera works great as it should and is water proof.battery last a long time. 
3561 it is a beautiful, fashionable product and i love it so much 
3562 Great value for money. 
3563 Everything fit in nicely. Nice sturdy case with handle. My only complaint is you have to be sure to open it right side up or it all falls out. It needs a lid inside so things don t fall out. 
3564 It replaced a like unit that I wore out. This one is in very good condition, and I am having absolutely no problems with the camera. Thanks for asking. 
3565 This worked very well for my very old Jason 12 x 40 binoculars. Easy to get on and off and kept the binoculars protected while in my backpack. 
3566 Excellent product. Well built n light! 
3567 I feel cheated, I did not get all of what I should be able to, the lens is only one, should the two 
3568 think tank is the way to go, I can carry my stuffs without a bag now 
3569 Works, good price 
3570 Camera did not recognize this battery as Info-Lithium. 
3571 Meh optics, sent it back. 
3572 Nice stand and price 
3573 I like the compactness and versatility. 
3574 Bought for daughter who is 10 
3575 Does what it says 
3576 Cheap cost. Well made. It s light and easy to operate. Awesome! 
3577 Very nice for a point and shoot. Takes great pictures does everything as advertised. 
3578 Works great with my Nikon D7100 
3579 Great batteries! Good charge time. 
3580 The original model order had been discontinued. The substituted camera (this model) has been installed and is working wonderfully. The images seem to be sharper. Quite happy with this purchase. 
3581 Works well. I have not had issues with it. 
3582 Great product. 
3583 Does not work 
3584 This camera is absolutely fantastic. I got it during one of the promotions, and I am very pleased with my decisions. The photo quality, camera size, battery life, wifi, etc all a plus. 
3585 Works great!! 
3586 I am very happy with all of our purchases. 
3587 Another cool go pro mount for a GREAT price! 
3588 My tv lamp popped five minutes after I put it in, the glass on it was in pieces, the product was defective, I have bought this product before and it took a year for it to do that, so I was very unsatified this time around 
3589 I use this periodically for my camera it works great. 
3590 Video recording quality is not that great but takes great shots. 
3591 I really love this camera bag. I have my camera, 2 lenses, a laptop, a sound recorder, headphones, and a ton of other stuff in it, and it holds everything in place very well. I would definitely recommend buying it! 
3592 Given as a gift. They really like it. 
3593 Very helpful and effective.Thanks! 
3594 I m very happy with the product. I received it quickly. Easy to use and durable. 
3595 A little bigger than I expected but works just like I wanted 
3596 Literally bs, pay so much for so little and such bad quality. It s like there s a horrible filter on every picture. Don t waste your time haha 
3597 Perfect for what I want, very lightweight and clear,crisp lenses. 
3598 Good stuff 
3599 Great Camera with lots of features. The WiFi transfer screen is bit confusing but its OK. 
3600 Works very well - program syncing with transmitter was easy to do 
3601 love this pack 
3602 Brand new! 
3603 The light was awesome! Works great! The adhesive didn t work very well on the car door though. Had to use a different kind. The bat signal is super crisp and clear, but the avengers one is just a bit fuzzy. 
3604 Excellent 
3605 Great camera. 
3606 No, used it on Sony Handycam HD, it did not improve telephoto capability the way I expected. 
3607 everyone is amazed of the output and capabilities 
3608 Good 
3609 Great product, got some new clothes to go with my new glasses and frames. Couldn t be happier! 
3610 Great product 
3611 Replacement was a snap. just follow directions. Your device will last longer and charge fully after the first few uses. 
3612 that plastic is so weak,keep tearing apart 
3613 I m having issues with charging it will not take a charge at all. I purchased the extended warranty with it but I m not sure how to claim it. Any help would be great. 
3614 The battery was about a millimeter off from the correct size, so it would only make momentary and unreliable contact with the Canon camera s battery housing, which made it unusable. Had to send it back. Return was handled promptly, but I would recommend using another retailer for this battery. 
3615 This is my second order love them. 
3616 disappointed in the fact that the autofocus feature on the camera will not work with this lens 
3617 Very cheap and not easy to use I ended up going to Sams Club and having my slides professionally transferred the Quality was so much better at Sams Club then this device claimed there product would be, Stay away from it, waist of time and money 
3618 Works great, motion sensor record good at 30 feet. Only 720p so not real sharp and low light recording is dark. It has IR but I don t use it and doubt if it would be any clearer. 
3619 The small diameter of the tripod are is prohibitive. I have a very small tripod (fits easily into a water bottle pouch on a bag), and I couldn t get it into this tiny thing. At best, the diameter is 1.5&#34;-2&#34;. Don t recommend. 
3620 Great addition to my GoPro accessories....quality product.....great price....BUY this is worth it! 
3621 Can t use my camera without this... 
3622 Thank you, :) 
3623 This bag is great! I highly recommend it. 
3624 bought to go with camera as gift for 11 year old very cute -she loves it 
3625 I sent the product back. It didn t hold time. Nor was it user friendly. It also only recorded short clips. 
3626 Simply perfect! 
3627 Great product and prompt shipment! Thanks!! 
3628 Small, light in weight and perfect to carry anywhere. Incredible customer service with immediate response to an issue I was having. I would order again in an instant 
3629 Lost mine along the path of the USA so I need another one and this is the one I picked works great on my camera. 
3630 Had to return it because it doesn t fit my T5i with the standard lens. 
3631 Arrived early and tested the product in the field and it works well.A good investment. 
3632 I used these inserts while scuba diving in Aruba. They worked very well, keeping the inside of my Go-Pro dry and fog-free! An excellent product. 
3633 solid purchase...haven t had to use them much as I tend to mount my camera in other ways more often than not. 
3634 Fit perfectly. A little pricey for not authentically Canon. Did not receive cleaner cloth shown in picture. 
3635 I am thrilled about the quality of images this camera produces. 
3636 This is a high quality case for gopro cameras. It comes with the foam insert and the construction and materials are excellent. There was a slight issue with my initial order but customer service took care of it right away. Great service! 
3637 This product is a very good ,it lets you know when someone is either coming on your drive way or on your drive way. Thanks Amazon. 
3638 Perfect 
3639 The filters are of good quality and easy to use. I only wish that I did n t have to buy all the different size adap. rings each time I buy more filters. I use 62 and 72mm only. The others are a waste of money. 
3640 Purchased two, one worked the other we sent back. Received the replacement in two days and works great. We love them. 
3641 Works great. 
3642 The best 35mm lens in the market. 
3643 I m really enjoying this camera. It replaces a Nikon that poor battery life. Happy to say that this camera takes awesome pictures and is so user friendly. I love the rechargeable batteries too! Would definitely purchase this one again. 
3644 Fast delivered, very nice! 
3645 Clear, colorful pictures, lightweight and easy to handle. The supplied accessories that came in this package are sufficient for starting out. Didn t realize it came with a second battery. 
3646 Love this camera easy to pack takes great pics and has a strong telephoto. 
3647 I could not set it up on an Android phone. Set it up with an iPad and then I could get notifications through email. I bought factory refurbished and the work fine. 
3648 Nice that they have different magnification 
3649 When I got it seemed OK after recording one time tried to record again when I needed it would not even light up. I had even charged it up to make sure had full charge. 
3650 Great camera. 
3651 Terrible product. Has a bounce upon each revolution of the bearings. 
3652 This is a great product. Totally recommended product. 
3653 fake 
3654 I bought it for my mirrorless camera, it is a good quality Camera Bag. 
3655 everthing is perfect. We are happy.... 
3656 my son loved this. 
3657 Awesome case , nice foam inserts 
3658 Just as described. 
3659 Original lens cap replacement. Design flaw is that there is no way to attach a string from the lens to the cap to prevent loss. 
3660 Good camera. Small. Takes good pics. 
3661 Nice 
3662 WORKS GREAT 
3663 Good Product, but it s not useful, due to the position of the camera. 
3664 This is a great little gadget. 
3665 Real little difference with the picture, but the product is very positive. 
3666 for my purposes it is great, light weight, nice zoom 
3667 The picture quality is good considering the resolution, .effective and easy to set up 
3668 Ok it works 
3669 Great Quality! For low-light applications the night vision works very well. It s like have a DVR at the front gate. 
3670 Adds lots of flexibility to any photo shoot 
3671 Installed easy to my alarm system. 
3672 did not order this camera 
3673 i would not recommend purchasing this item.. for a few more dollars you can can abetter product 
3674 Was shipped with an incorrect ac adapter. After purchasing a new adapter I found the camera did not function at all. I returned it. 
3675 Very useful product. Excellent condition. 
3676 My son loves this. So much came in this kit. For the price, I was concerned about the quality. I was wrong, the quality is great. He has used all the pieces multiple times and hasn t had any issues. Great quality, great price, great product. 
3677 Best purchase for the money. It keeps my cameras handy. 
3678 Excellent 
3679 I love this tripod, I saw a review of this tripod on Amazon reviews in a video with a gentleman withe no hands. It came already assembled. 
3680 Great camera. The optical and the digital zooms are better than expected. The picture quality is excellent. Even after a few years of use. 
3681 The wrong charger and battery was shipped. Parts shipped was not as advertised. 
3682 It fits perfectly and the string is perfect. Why the original didn t come like this I ll never know. Sony messed up. I lost it before I d had my camera a week. I believe this one will hang around longer! 
3683 Well built, saves the hassle of running a separate power line to the camera or other device! 
3684 It s all ok! 
3685 The battery last twice the time than the stock one in my camera. Honestly I am very please with this and I would recommend to anyone. 
3686 Arlo has many holders available. You get a bunch and an adjustable one with the $499.95 kit. they all work well. I bought 2 extras because I wanted to mount the cameras differently. It is a matter of your taste on what you want to use. 
3687 The camera and lens that comes with it are a good quality, all the other stuff is junk and not even compatable with this camera 
3688 Bad quality 
3689 The plug works very well charged my camera right a way 
3690 Tried to get ADT Pulse Hub to recognize it. Never was successful. I can t say whether it was the Pulse Hub or the Wi-Fi Repeater but it has never worked. 
3691 awesome 
3692 Cheap and convenience 
3693 don t buy it doesn t work with 1DX :( 
3694 Bought this for my Dad s 90th birthday. Arrived before they said it would. Was easy to set up. Very happy with it. 
3695 great product 
3696 Product was as advertised. 
3697 These lens caps are perfect for keeping your GoPro lens clean and scratch free. Perfect fit and the lanyards are a good size. 
3698 it works 
3699 This camera has been awesome to use. Really need a tripod for the super zoom to work. 
3700 no what I expected. Not expecting a fisheye look. I thought it was just a wide angle lens. 
3701 Awesome product! 
3702 I own a Blackmagic Cinema Camera and I was looking for a good wide angle lens. This lens is the perfect match for this camera to establish great long shots. 
3703 Camera is great but seller indicated all accessory and that didn t happen camera 5 stares seller 21/2 
3704 Great bundle. It had everything I needed to get started taking pictures. 
3705 Great product. Would have given 5 stars but the view when hanging on the wall is a little dark from the bottom. Will lower Frame or tilt to fix. 
3706 Great dea!! 
3707 great 
3708 Cap is good. Fits well. However it is unclear how the strap can be fastened. It is a big loop 
3709 Battery door is very difficult to open. Otherwise I love it as alleviates having to change batteries during shoots. 
3710 Great Quality. Great Value. Great company. 
3711 Works great , but is 720x480 ... P5534 is better! 
3712 Super fast shipping, amazing product. Made our vacation special. 
3713 Excellent camera, just the size I was looking for. It does much more than what I know what to use it for, but it takes great photos. 
3714 Pain in the ass.... The recording is complicating and the wires gets all over.. Going wireless next time 
3715 Conterfeit item,does not work for nikon camera 
3716 So far so good. Fits great, holds great. Seems well made. Use it with my drift camera and it holds that no problem. 
3717 This is a large bag that fits my canon slr with the huge 200 mm lens, and two other lenses. Easy access to The camera and plenty of compartments 
3718 My daughter loved it! Her friends and her had fun with taking pictures. 
3719 not very functional. 
3720 Exactly as described! Fits Canon Charger perfectly and of course the camera. Would purchase this item again and from this vendor as well. 
3721 easily a quarter of the price for same quality you would get out of something 3 to 4 more times expensive. 
3722 Great camera. I received it on Wed and used it yesterday for the first time. It is great that it comes with the SD card so it can be used out of the box. The picture/video quality was really good. I am happy I purchased it. 
3723 Ver y good 
3724 Not sure if was defective or just junk, but it only recorded 7 minutes until it started deleting the previous videos. This was on a 64mb card with 11 hours of available space. 
3725 Cannot beat such a neat little reflector/diffuse for such a low cost! Used it on a shoot today, worked perfectly! Gave just the right amount of flash that I needed to fill my subjects with! Would definitely recommend for someone on a budget and needs something simple. 
3726 Great product, easy to apply and use. Helps to place on an additional/extra back plate for change out during non-water use. 
3727 I bought one adapter before this one and it didn t work. (Maybe you saw my other review.) My pentax pk lense mounted easily to to the adapter, and it mounted even easier to my camera. 
3728 It s terrific having three optimized USB ports for charging phones and keeping my MIFI running while on the road. This device works very well. 
3729 These are great. Good buy. Will buy again. 
3730 The harness is a perfect match. It allows me to do the activities I love and create memories at the same time. I would definitely recommend! 
3731 Nice,look little fragile 
3732 a great addition to the gopro hero 4 black. 
3733 very good kit and lens 
3734 The first one broke as soon as I got it so I had another shipped...seller was great, item somewhat cheap 
3735 Batteries are a perfect fit and perform just like the originals. I like the charger also because it is not a fast charger and the batteries stand up in it and not laying down. 
3736 This is a terrific filter. I would continue to order Tiffen products. 
3737 good case 
3738 not a movement friendly camera though and no sports setting 
3739 The screw in plate that connects to the camera tripod mount was not threaded. There is at least one other reviewer that had the same problem. 
3740 Good light 
3741 Awesome 
3742 can t seem to get it to work right 
3743 Fits, no problems. Does the job. 
3744 Better than I thought it would be!! 
3745 A useful product of rather good quality. 
3746 it is very helpful 
3747 I bought this for my husband for christmas and he likes it. For the price, you would expect it to take a little bit better pictures but its ok. Only other con is that it goes through batteries very quickly. 
3748 Works as well as the branded battery. 
3749 Great value for the money and shipped quick. 
3750 Received my new battery charger in a flash. The product was of good quality and used it immediately upon receiving thanks 
3751 Fits well and thanks to the variety of sizes, you have options to make it work for your need. 
3752 Could not see a thing during night or day!! Returned. 
3753 My teen loved it 
3754 Excellent for see horse race 
3755 Great 
3756 No comments 
3757 The charge pack is so small and compact 
3758 Received product on time unit was well built and Exceeded my expectations for the price Had a small problem with tilt function but has been resolved. Great product for the money. 
3759 I love this lens. I have taken some really amazing macro photos. It came on time and was in good condition. 
3760 What fun! Takes some training to fly this properly, but it s a lot of fun to learn. 10 minutes goes by very quickly. Can t wait to test video capability. 
3761 Cute protective case but I m always a little paranoid of the side hinge coming undone. 
3762 good 
3763 Great little portable light source. It s very bright and compact so it takes little room in my camera bag. can be used as a fill-in source for close up photo s as well. Well morth the money, a good value. 
3764 This tripod is fantastic! Heavy duty quality construction, versatile adjustments, works perfect with my Nikon D5500 DSLR. Looked at many tripods and none come close to this for the price. Home run Amazon. 
3765 Constantly falls off camera lens, very limited use. 
3766 Very cheap looking and sheer. 
3767 Easy to use, instant gratification and lots of fun for teens who want more than posting pics. 
3768 Excellent product, a hard to find replacement battery charger. Works as advertised 
3769 Simple to use. Easy to understand instructions. Feels solid but can be a little finicky. Getting everything set-up correctly and it s a good remote. 
3770 Great camera, the zoom is incredible, i recommend it 
3771 all products delivered as advertised. 
3772 Great value - 1/3 boxes so far good. Can t find a better deal else where! 
3773 No leaks! Years of use now! 
3774 My nephew loves this. Easy to set up. Great resolution. Fantastic for all ages. 
3775 A+ thanks 
3776 This really works well. My wife uses it with the GoPro when scuba diving and it s great. Has never flooded on dozens of dives so feel free to keep whatever you need in the handle and it will stay dry. 
3777 Very nice product, daughter loves it for her new GoPro. 
3778 GOOD QUALITY NO INSTRUCTIONS 
3779 I must have older Flip...these wont plug into mine goofed again 
3780 Original Canon hood, so how to say, even though there is a circle gap between lense, it may be normal or supposed to be? I guess. 
3781 Like it it serve the purpose. 
3782 Works perfectly. 
3783 For a basic green screen setup this is ok, I only gave it 3 stars because the price is WAY too high. Also, there is no way to hang it long ways. 
3784 The quality of picture not that clear 
3785 package not good very poor 
3786 Not worth the money. Does not fit properly. 
3787 Great everyday lens should you not want to carry the extra bulk of the larger lens and just want to take snaps and not think too much. Bokeh effect is good on close subjects. 
3788 Very nice, light, and stable tripod that straps perfectly under my backpack. I like the latching leg hardware. Quick and easy. Ball top is stableand quick-connect mechanism is secure. 
3789 Magnet not sticky enough 
3790 I would recommend this product 
3791 Works nicely! 
3792 A bit too big for my day to day needs, but still a good set. 
3793 Good charger. Better than expected for price 
3794 it is very easy to use very convnient i like it. also they have best friendly customer service. 
3795 The case looked really cool. The clasp however were cheap and was hard to snap or take off. 
3796 I bought it as a gift....it was happily recieved and used. 
3797 I changed all the settings on the back to self timer on my Canon 6d and I could not get this remote to work. I even replaced the battery inside to see if that was the issue & it still didn t work. Having to return it. :( 
3798 Awesome product, fast delivery. Thanks! 
3799 I m so glad I bought this! I had a great zoom lens before, but this is lighter to carry around and all the pictures just come out great! 
3800 Neat camera with great features. Like using it with my phone but the app is a little weak. Wifi stopped working after a few months and now the camera is worthless. Too Bad! 
3801 It is a great neoprene cover that protects the camera from scratches and minor bumps. It is adjustable and that makes a lot easier to use the same camera cover with a variety of lenses 
3802 Great Camera. 
3803 NO! It didn t! The darn thing didn t even work! I hope NOONE ever buys anything from Discount Jungle ever again! They are crooked! Update: July 2016- I NEVER got a replacement camera or my money back! 
3804 You get what you pay for. I spent way too much time on each prop to get them as close to balanced as I could. The system didnt seem to be very accurate on any even and balanced surface I tried it on. 
3805 Good quality if you are a person that takes care of your things. I hesitated at first with some of the comments about quality, however no product will last if you don t take care of it. Excellent value for the price. 
3806 It doesn t work 
3807 I put this on my E-M5, and it really helps give a more stable grip... adds just enough size to let my hand hold the camera more naturally. 
3808 good 
3809 Solid company 
3810 Not in love with the color. Feel like it washes out the color in your image. They re fair. But not high quality. 
3811 I like the customization available with the velcro insert - it fits my needs perfectly! The shipping was super fast and the item was exactly as advertised. 
3812 Perfect product :) 
3813 works great 
3814 This crap will void your gopro warrentee, do not purchase it. 
3815 excellent! 
3816 Outstanding Item and fast shipping. 
3817 excellent item, solved my problem 
3818 This camera did not meet my expectations because the motion detector mode and the sound detector mode activated the camera every 2 minutes for two hours. It works okay in manual mode and the image quality is mediocre. It does come with may attachments for mounting the camera. 
3819 You really get what you pay for here. The filters scratch VERY easily. 
3820 Excellent product very good seller 
3821 It brings life to my camera but it needs some upgrades. It needs to mark the buttons better. I like it a lot. It s not easy to use the camera at first. It definetly protects the body. 
3822 just a tipp to the EU customs offices. This device MUST NOT be imported to the EU because of a lack of user manual in EU languages. The user manual is only chines which has to be taken ass an afront to EU regulations and againt EU customers. 
3823 Awesome product & awesome quality 
3824 Didn t work with my Nikon D750 even though it says it is compatible. I spent an additional $5 for a new battery and still doesn t work. Save yourself the hassle and some money in the long run by passing on this and buying the Nikon brand. 
3825 Excelent! 
3826 Great mounting kit, with this kit you can really mount the remote anywhere. I have it mounted on my goPole to use as a selfie stick for my girls. 
3827 Does exactly what it s supposed to do - securely holds my flash onto my light stand. The clamp for holding an umbrella is a little tight at first, but that gives me piece of mind that it s secure. 
3828 The perfect addition to the RX-100 series of cameras. It gives you a nice gripping point that allows for a much firmer grip on the camera... 
3829 Use this for astrophotography. Works great. Use on Pentax cameras 
3830 Item works great. One must go online to read directions though as the printed edition has minute printing. 
3831 This was a great purchase with the GoPro camera! 
3832 perfect 
3833 Maybe it was me but I could not get the thing to zoom in and see anything. I returned it. 
3834 I bought this as a baby monitor and it does not work. The recording lags sometimes minutes behind real time or will time out completely. Nothing scares a new mother more than to wake up and see the video frozen. 
3835 This is renamed Looxcie LX2 which I have with 480p at 4:3 aspect ratio, good enough for the price I bought for $40.00. Red LED lit if recording, if you try filming ongoing police activity better cover that red LED with black cut out electrical tape before doing so, lol. 
3836 Motion detector does not work properly need to send it back to get exchange 
3837 So far so good! 
3838 Looks great, awesome quality 
3839 great 
3840 I miss the buttons that you normally get other that that great little compact 
3841 all ok 
3842 Great product and service, 
3843 My wife enjoys this camera,body color and great resolution 
3844 As described 
3845 I knew Bolide for good quality security equipment, but this change my mind, i bought 8 units, and 5 are defective, during almost 4 months of working well, 5 of 8, got a bad image. Really disappointed for this bad experience. 
3846 Ordered this case for my Hello Kitty Polaroid came and it fits like a glove. Took the camera to the beach and the case did its job well. No sand got into the lens and kept it safe. 
3847 Great thanks! 
3848 Great option for a cheap ND filter. There is some dark banding when turned all the way up in bright outdoor environments, but otherwise very usable footage. 
3849 Dose it record video with voices or without voices? 
3850 Very tight fit. Runs small 
3851 really good point and shoot camera. would highly recommend as a first camera. 
3852 This is a stylish photo album to put these pictures in !!! This is a bueatiful album looking in it just. Makes my day 
3853 perfect perfect perfect 
3854 better than expected, great value , at this price and quality can not go wrong. if your in the market for go pro accessories, this is the one to get. 
3855 Fast and Reliable 
3856 this is a nice screen protector it has done its job protecting the LCD and it is easy to install 
3857 Good product 
3858 Love this BW film. Dark blacks, bright whites and everything in between. Great in low light, really excellent! No grain, crisp. A fave. 
3859 I was very happy with the charger for my camera. 
3860 Easy setup. Works great.Excelent product support. 
3861 Well made and very spacious. For enthusiasts who like to protect their investment, this is an excellent case. Likes: size, depth of compartments, stability of drone storage. The retractable handle and wheels are very smooth when using. Dislikes: none. 
3862 Just what I ordered were perfect for my photos job 
3863 This one seems to have a very hard time staying connected to the wifi without being power cycled every day. The version below or before this one seems to need a power cycle once a month if that. 
3864 Works as advertised. 
3865 great tripod. The legs each have 3 adjustable sections. Feels light but solid as well. I debated between this one and a few options in the $20-30 range. I am glad I decided to spend the extra money for a brand name and still reasonably priced. 
3866 Nice to have both options for charging. 
3867 I love this product for my nikon d750! Arrived on time and was easy to apply. I highly recommend it!! 
3868 i like the side 
3869 Nice Nice Nice 
3870 Works if you only want to take less than 99 photos per sequence. Mine broke because of poor quality battery door, but mfg replaced it. Next time I ll spend more and get one that will take unlimited photos. 
3871 Stellar product!! A++++ seller, the only thing which was a personal preference was, I didn t like was the floating wristlet. 
3872 This camera was the most difficult installation I have ever come across (updates are way too complicated) and support and software was lacking. Would not recommend this camera to anyone!. 
3873 Awesome 
3874 Equipment is very durable! I am very satisfied with everything in the package I purchased. I would definitely recommend these products to anyone! 
3875 Nice unit, but for the price they should include the transformer 
3876 Fantastic. Was exactly what I needed for an active vacation. 
3877 Works perfectly on my D7100 and D3200. One of the best (and reasonalby priced) investments I have made thus far. I just wish I had picked this up before wasting $$ on various remote units. 
3878 I m enjoying my dvr it s clear and sharp for what I need it for... 
3879 Worked great 
3880 Fits my Canon t2i + 24-105, with my Speedlite on top ( not attached ) - I put this in my waterproof bag and take to the beach. 
3881 Good parts. Would recommend 
3882 Excellent for interview lighting. The boom is dangerously flimsy, don t use it. 
3883 This poser worked very well. The filling instructions that came with it worked well too, but was beneficial to have two people to do it. 
3884 perfect fit on the NETGEAR ARLO cameras 
3885 This item fits great on my Canon T5i as well as my ring light!!! Quick shipping too! 
3886 only records 20 min and stops and starts again...not able torecord a full event 
3887 Seems to work as expected. Delivered on time. 
3888 excellent 
3889 Great camera,but if you need to use there instruction booklet it s pretty much useless,got better advice from other people s reviews. 
3890 Delivery was fast. I have the vortex solo 10x36 as well and this has a more clear focus and seems a much bigger magnification than just 2. Although not as compact the polaris is a much better buy for the money. I highly recommend. 
3891 Me and my kids love it 
3892 Well built. 
3893 Exactly the way they described. 
3894 fast delivery everything as promised 
3895 Fairly easy to use and takes very good pictures. My wife likes the ease of use and I like the WiFi connection to my computer for quick download. the Canon software is a download, so be prepared to take care of that if you want to use the WiFi feature. 
3896 Working well .I had trouble with written instructions. Maybe just me I biggest problem is getting it to stay looking forward in pocket nothing wrong with camera. I am going to try a pocket protector to keep it straight 
3897 My wife is a bit OCD and wanted order and this product was great. Great shipping and I will be utilizing them again. 
3898 Got all the basics that one needs. 
3899 Good sturdy camera, mounts easy, easy setup, comes with all the plugs and wires, counterbalance weight for the gimble. I mounted it all on a Cheerson CX-20 and it fit like a glove. Even survived a crash with no damage. 
3900 The set I received have no lining. They are just neoprene bags. They are okay. Certainly nothing like advertised. 
3901 Great Camera. can t go wrong though with a cannon! 
3902 Given as GIFT and she loved it. Recommend 
3903 These work great- I have several lenses and these cleaned them all right up. I mostly use canon ef lenses but they work great for pentax as well as my Nikon lenses. Definitely a but I d recommend to photographers who like to keep their lenses clean on the go. 
3904 Camera is great but lenses are crap, cheap and don t work on auto focus. Buy body and lenses separately. 
3905 Lasted 3 months as a backup battery and stopped working completely. 
3906 Can t believe I waited so lonh to switch to an over the shoulder style strap. This beats the tradition &#34;around the neck&#34; setup in so many ways. 
3907 I love it. Specially image quality! 
3908 Product arrived before scheduled delivery date and is as described! 
3909 Compact and easy to use. 
3910 Light, portable, rapid set-up, easy take-down. 
3911 Just what I needed 
3912 Love this thing. It s just tricky to close. The first time closing it was a nightmare; it didn t come with instructions. You can find wonderful youtube instructions, though. 
3913 Easy to place in my purse while traveling. 
3914 It s very easy to use, easy to clean, if it get s scratched, I have a spare. A good product to protect your screen 
3915 It works quite OK as it s price. 
3916 Perfect for my needs 
3917 everything fits in it s proper spot safe and secure! Only thing I would change is have optional shoulder straps! 
3918 Bought it as a gift and the daughter in law and she loves it! 
3919 It does not support 960H 
3920 Good stuff! 
3921 good products 
3922 Just as described 
3923 Awesome product! Very easy set up and they work great! 
3924 A better battery than battery that came with camera so far. 
3925 Excellent case. No longer need to worry about my go pro. 
3926 I have used this lens a lot recently. It is a gem. For a novice like me it is enabling me to produce some awesome nature photographs. Although it is a manual focus, it is very easy to use. I will not hesitate to recommend it. 
3927 These are solid and seem well made. I m using them to convert some older tripods to the Arca type quick release plates. They work fine with my Surui quick release plates, too. 
3928 Battery works great. Delivered on time. Great price. 
3929 Perfect fit! Made my camera look like new again! 
3930 Useless junk - it burned both my original Canon batteries - do not buy! 
3931 Case C6721591 Badge Ar004276 Product works great Technical support is EXCELLENT AND very courteous and helpful My Tech support listened to the problem and had the answers to resolve quickly THANK YOU 
3932 excellent!!! I have not use them yet. 
3933 I ve been using this light on top of my DSLR for wedding filming and it s perfect, high quality and I love the magnet snap on filters. 
3934 Fast delivery and the build quality is great. I reviewed about 10 floating GoPro grips in preparation for a Hawaii vacation. Glad I did the research. This handle looks great and has a good feel. 
3935 Bought as a gift and....Dad loved it! He s a carrier of multi-thousand dollar equipment and put his trust in this bag! 
3936 Decent case. 
3937 Recommend 
3938 Awesome bag for my new 13&#34; Macbook Pro with Retina screen and iPad. 
3939 Does not come with door or window sensors. Product is useless unless you have an alarm already in place. VERY DISAPPOINTED! 
3940 My camera works great. I ve had it for almost a year and haven t had any problems. 
3941 I ve used these all summer for about 4 weddings and they have never failed me once. Excellent bang for your buck if you re not looking to go over crazy spending! 
3942 Honestly, I feel like I get better white balance when using my white and grey cards. I followed the instructions in the video but this just doesn t work that well, in my opinion. 
3943 Works great. 
3944 Super quality 
3945 Great deal. Excellent bag for my Nikon D3300! 
3946 Great product. Perfect for the car. Love the charge percentage 
3947 It s pretty tight to release, but otherwise works great. Use it on my sailboat. 
3948 Great deal!!! 
3949 nice device 
3950 I bought these for a coworker and she loves the convenience of not having to find a place for her lens cap. 
3951 Did not work they were not compatible with the batteries 
3952 Last night I tested this device with my Panasonic GH4. It worked, as expected. 
3953 Worked great 
3954 Fast shipping great item 
3955 This was exactly what I needed! Perfectly well suited for my wants! 
3956 Fits perfectly and affordable! Will order again!! 
3957 great product 
3958 I love this camera bag it s light weight and holds everything I need. The strap sits perfectly on my shoulder and doesn t bother my neck. 
3959 It s perfect. I have several Cannon accessories for my camera but I m not a professional photographer and I want to carry my camera alone sometimes, so this is the perfect case for JUST YOUR camera. 
3960 Brilliant lens - wish it were cheaper. Will give 5 stars if it cost ~220$. I do repent buying the olympus camera - very expensive lenses. 
3961 Great value! 
3962 Works great, good price too... 
3963 I ve used these refills for decades and they work very well. Pictures are preserved and easily taken in an out even decades later. 
3964 great price and so easy to fly 
3965 Great filter. Great price on Amazon Prime day! 
3966 Nice roomy case and I love that the dividers are movable! 
3967 Works well 
3968 OK 
3969 worst pursuce ever on amazon does not record at all and just blinks fast and does nothing else so pissed 
3970 Works for the most part, but not as useful as I thought it would be. 
3971 Bought this at Khols and it could not install on my computer or my dad s. We tried everything! What a huge waste of money. 
3972 These are a great way to keep track of your lens cap. Works great! 
3973 Good quality, sturdy. Proved to be more durable​ than those that cost 4 times as much. 
3974 Works perfectly for the price. Simple to use. 
3975 Handy device for long exposures. In that it also has a timer built in makes it a great buy. 
3976 Very happy. Great value in the bundle. 
3977 I returned this after a few days - difficult to use, doesn t work in low light, and recording time is extremely limited. 
3978 I haven t really had a chance to use this like I want to but so far its worked perfectly. My kids are in sports and go to a lot of sporting events and this is the zoom I needed for all of it! 
3979 needs information for all strap use 
3980 SO FAR ITS GOOD STILL IN THE PROCESS OF USING IT IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS 
3981 Oustanding customer service after the sale. Thank you Walter for patiently guiding me through reinstalling the software settings. 
3982 Item was exactly as described, shipped super fast and packaged well. Couldn t be happier with the purchase. 
3983 Works great 
3984 It is so handy.. Save so much time and space by having splitter.. Good price also.. 
3985 the flash works but does not work with my canon 5Ti 
3986 also, the flash is not the one where you can remotely use on its own. 
3987 Kind of expensive but it works really well and is super solid. 
3988 Excellent 
3989 I use the StackShot for macrophotography of minerals. It works amazingly, allowing me to capture incredibly crisp images of my collection. 
3990 has some great features, that it can fly itself is awesome 
3991 Great product.. 
3992 Quick and easy to use and easy set up. 
3993 One of the items came incomplete. I would like to contact the seller accordingly. 
3994 You can rotate whether right eye or left eye you are using in viewfinder. 
3995 I have purchased from Certified before, the first time was in person, and am still very satisfied. Great product, great warranty, and quick service. I would not hesitate to refer or use them again. 
3996 Did not work. So inexpensive I didn t bother to send it back. Just order another more expensive one the next go around. 
3997 The shipping was super quick! Once i opened the package everything was true to the pictures if not even cuter! Very pleased with this order :) 
3998 My first time ordering from Amazon and loved it. Will order again in the future. 
3999 Good video for small cam. Not mac friendly, had to download a converter. SOUND SUCKS, very low fidelity sound. Ya get whatcha pay for. It s worth something, not much though. 
4000 Simple and effective setup with easy to use. 
4001 I really like this case and it is built really well! 
4002 Arrived on time and is great quality! 
4003 Excellent !! 
4004 Lost my original charger, I m happy to have my camera back. 
4005 I ve just used it once so far, but it worked perfectly and was easy to program 
4006 Works great and arrived on time. Thank you 
4007 This was a much more comfortable replacement to the stock shoulder pad that came with my rig. I love that it fits snuggly on the shoulder. 
4008 Worked fine 
4009 If you have a waterproof camera, this is a MUST. You can toss the camera in the pool/ocean ahead of you and then grab it. great for snorkeling adventures. 
4010 Amazing product. works great. Definitely recommend it. 
4011 Excellent on mountain biking, motorbiking and jetskiing. 
4012 Broke right away. Didn t even have a chance to take any video. 
4013 Not really very happy with this product. It s difficult to use and doesn t give a very good charge to the battery. I rarely leave a bad review about a product, but this one warrants it. 
4014 Great system 
4015 Good battery. Finally one that could be charged and not continuously replaced 
4016 Very tall, sturdy and has all the bells and whistles I could ask for. Very Happy with purchase. So nice that it is so light. 
4017 Fine 
4018 Great walk around lens. I also use this for portrait sessions with excellent results. Image quality is top notch. I hardly ever change lenses now. 
4019 very effective and simple to use 
4020 This is a great price and works perfectly. I use it to trigger external flashes - does the job well. I was also pleasantly surprised to see all needed batteries were included in the package. 
4021 Case C6729888 tech ID AR004273 helped get cameras set up properly. thanks Henry 
4022 Everything was extraordinary 
4023 I have this on the Olympus 45mm f.18 and it doesn t really look good attached to the lens. It does do it s job of protecting my lens from debris and lens flare but I ll most likely end up replacing it with a higher qualit yone soon. 
4024 Awesome beauty dish. I love the quality of light and its very easy to assemble. 
4025 These batteries work maintain charge just as well as the stock batteries. With the charging dock included for these 2 batteries as well as another slot for the stock battery, this is a must-have for anyone who plans on using their GoPro for more than a few hours. 
4026 Excellent value 
4027 Can t beat it for the money 
4028 I kinda didn t believe I could get everything shown for such a low price...but I did. And it works! 
4029 perfectly meets the expectations. Thank you 
4030 Got this for my gopro didn t like it too much at first. But after talking to customer service they offered to exchange the old one out for a new one. The new selfiestick operate a lot smoother than the first. 
4031 Works well enough, but it came with a hole on the edge. 
4032 It s bulky. I pretty much don t use it because of this. 
4033 gave it as a gift for a GoPro since this was the specific brand that he wanted it. He has used the batteries and charger for about a month or so and has no complains thus far. 
4034 Within 24 hours of regular, everyday kind of use, it stopped working. Boo. 
4035 Good combo. (The tripod adds no value though) Great deal. 
4036 just what i wanted 
4037 Brushes are nice but the bulb is quite useless. Too dinky and as you squeeze the nozzle is moving in all directions. Get the biggest Bulb you can find. 
4038 Fits well and camera snaps well into harness 
4039 I bought this to use as a plein air easel for watercolor painting. I m still in the process of getting my attachments set up for it so I haven t used it outside yet. For the price, it seems stable, lightweight and has all the features I needed. 
4040 Henry was excellent and set up 4 cameras in 15 min Great camera s at a very nice price 
4041 Decent 
4042 Very good product love it 
4043 Item arrived damaged and dirty. Doesn t look new at all. After further inspection item is broken in several places and missing parts. Can t believe the shape it s in..it s terrible!!!!! 
4044 Took a little longer to arrive than expected, but it s everything I needed. 
4045 I just received the batteries, and they work beautifully so far. I am hopeful that they will last the test of time. They seem a great value for the money. 
4046 Macro is not great. Better buy separate macro lens. The sharpness and clarity is hugely compromised. 
4047 The video was too sharp the pictures were crisp it is going to make me a great camera like my 50d and my other canon each has it s uses 
4048 Very happy with the camera and bundle. It takes great pictures. The company failed to send part of the order, but were very quick to send a refund. 
4049 Good purchase and still working. Thanks. 
4050 Works great! Good Quality! Would definitely recommend! 
4051 Works great. 
4052 This works great 
4053 I like it very much it is great for when you travel and you want to take photographs. 
4054 This camera is so fun, cute and reliable. My daughter has made a scrapbook of all her moments in time since she got this camera. She is 13 and loves it. 
4055 good cam 
4056 wheels are very cheap and loud. 
4057 This camera works well underwater. Have not developed the film yet. 
4058 Priced Great - Nice Size - Quick Delivery 
4059 Great product and great service. 
4060 The vibration sensors worked the best and super easy to install. You have to have exactly the right door and window configuration for the two piece alarms. Certainly not foolproof, but a bit of a deterrent. 
4061 works great 
4062 So far working good with my 50 mm/1.8 Nikon lens.I made some interesting shots. 
4063 Very cool product, works well. I look forward to using it. 
4064 I was nervous about ordering a refurbished product, but I m IN LOVE with this camera. This is my first Dslr and i hope to take it with me on my trip to spain this spring. 
4065 Product is what I expected for the money. Everything works well. Havent used it in photoshoot but plan on doing so soon. 
4066 Great fixed lens. Equivalent to 50mm on Canon 60D. Fast and excellent quality. My &#34;go to&#34; lens&#34; 
4067 This battery works just as well as my Nikon battery! It looks a little bit different, but I ll be buying a few more of these over the next year. 
4068 Works Great! I was missing a rear lens cap and for only a few bucks I could pass on this deal I would recommend this product for sure. 
4069 Great camera. Amazing price. It needs a steady photographer but for the price is an amazing buy. 
4070 Great deal. Good little kit for the price. Really happy with my purchase 
4071 Rod bends when fully extended. Also button is useless and doesn t work. 
4072 The floaty backdoor works great. I have a couple of them. The adhesive is very strong. This is cheap insurance. If your camera slips from your hand its great to see it floating up, rather than sinking to the bottom. Believe me I know. 
4073 extra batteries are a must with go pros 
4074 It won t fit my camera, but I think it should be okay to use for other camera. 
4075 Camera is perfect for me and it has helped me with my golf swing. J-Made ensured that I got it quickly and I appreciated their excellent customer service in doing so. 
4076 Just as good, if not better than the hood that came with the lens. 
4077 Perfect 
4078 I am not a professional so this backpack works well for me with the couple lenses I have. Great backpack, seems well made and I like that it has all the compartments for lenses and other equipment. 
4079 works great so far so good 
4080 It s not so accuracy. 
4081 Great product at a fantastic price I am very happy with this set. 
4082 Perfect replacement 
4083 Nikon MH-67P Battery Chager was just what I wanted & works great 
4084 Just as described and works amazingly. 
4085 I bought it as a birthday gift and My friend loves it! Great gift idea for people who loves taking pictures on their iphone and get keepsake instant prints. 
4086 Hated it. It leaves a film that is like paste on lense 
4087 Perfect for my Galaxy 6 and I love the bluetooth remote. 
4088 Very Poor Quality 
4089 Hard to focus. 
4090 Henry did an excellent job setting up my camera. It is amazing how smooth everything works ...picture is very clear on my phone. I think I will get a couple more for the other side of the store. 
4091 Great battery at a great price. 
4092 It does exactly what I need 
4093 it takes great pictures - I am quite pleased with it. 
4094 just tried one it s great! 
4095 great seller - delivered as promised! 
4096 Great product ,never have to worry about losing caps again ! 
4097 Excellent 
4098 I am still learning how to use it, but so far it has lived up to expectations. Good quality at an affordable price. 
4099 Didn t notice really any difference.... 
4100 Quality Goods 
4101 Great film. Perfect for quick small pictures. 
4102 Awesome! Finally can get good pics at night like the moon and sky etc. 
4103 Thank you, very happy with the management of purchase - sale. 
4104 Very affordable protection for you home without monthly fees. Alarm is ear piercing. I have one on every window and door in my house. Batteries last a long time and are replaceable when needed. Small enough and portable enough to use even when traveling 
4105 Good product 
4106 Floppy 
4107 Solid product. Great price and it works well. The floaty device was even able to keep my GoPro (Hero version 1) plus the pole afloat in salt water. Haven t tested in fresh water yet. 
4108 This is what I need for capturing those big fish, and not having to worry about dropping my GoPro! 
4109 Excellent cleaning clothes for your glasses. They clean 100 % without leaving any mark on them!!! 
4110 charged one set of batteries right after I received it. After not using it for for a season it would not work for the second set. It will not even light up for the battery charge. 
4111 Worked perfectly for me. I haven t had any problems with either mount. Both have performed as expected. I would recommend this for anyone looking for either mount, it s a great way to get both mounts for a good price. 
4112 The Wasabi Power Battery Pack was just as described on Amazon. It also was delivered in appropriate time 
4113 Excellent quality 
4114 great pics - easy to use - love it 
4115 Good for lightweight cameras but not good for heavier models. 
4116 Works great. Love how you can tell how charged the battery is. Extra USB on the side is useful. Only complain, and why I only gave 4 stars, is the size of the unit, would be nice if it was more compact 
4117 These are ok antistatic bags but please note that 10x15 are the exterior dimensions, not interior dimensions (typically interior dimensions are used for other antistatic bags I ve gotten). The interior dimensions on these bags are 9x13cm 
4118 Happy with my charger 
4119 Just received the frame. It was very easy to set up. It came with a 16 GB usb. I loaded my pictures, and plugged it in, and it was ready to go. Very easy. The HD is awesome compared to my last picture frame. 
4120 product as advertised, very good 
4121 Works great. Just what I was looking for. Great product 
4122 I kind of wish I had bought a bigger one since this was smaller than I thought it would be. For what it is though, It performs perfectly. 
4123 Very good,good finish 
4124 Ill keep it simple because I m a novice. It s a great product. 
4125 Very easy to use. Fast shipping and great quality. 
4126 Love love it! 
4127 works perfectly as described 
4128 Works with my Cannon, great deal 
4129 I need a manual, it only records a minute at a time then skips a lot. and is there software to make play list, edit, add music? I hope someone can help me? I d like to give a better review .... I just think I never got the instructions. 
4130 Typical Nikon quality with fast auto focusing and sharp images. It is my &#34;go to&#34; lens for most situations. A+ 
4131 This was okay but I wasn t happy with some of functionality. So I returned it. I wanted something a little bit more high-end. However for the price it will do the job. 
4132 it s what I needed 
4133 Never needed this so far 
4134 nice product 
4135 Packaging bent it where I don t know if crease will come out. BUMMER!!! otherwise this should be a great item! 
4136 Great product at a good price! 
4137 really good , but with the time the water breaks in 
4138 Works great, holds any size tablet tight, unlike the one that comes with the Phantom 3. 
4139 Great 
4140 great product worth the money 
4141 Happy to find a replacement at a reasonable price. 
4142 Very good item 
4143 Does exactly what it is supposed to! 
4144 My daughter loved these items! 
4145 Bought on lighting deal. Had to return after a week. Delay on motion detection is ridiculous. What s the point. Got my refund. 
4146 Excellent case. 
4147 Excellent! Most comfortable strap I ve ever used...even with a heavy camera (Nikon D810) and lens (Nikkor 24-70 f/2.8). 
4148 I use these all the time with my GoPro and GoPole. I recently traveled and wanted to make sure I didn t lose my camera during my adventures and these made me feel a lot better about doing anything crazy with my GoPro 
4149 Fast delivery. Product as stated in the description,good quality at very good price 
4150 The Bag seems sturdy enough to hold up under use, however I have not as yet had the opportunity to use it outdoors. 
4151 Thank you 
4152 Worked exactly as described, easy to fit (perfect fit) no bubbles. As I already had one handy, I put a clear plastic protector over it, all works perfectly. 
4153 It was just as described and fit my camera battery. 
4154 Good product. Works as advertised. Would be great to see support for home automation systems such as Amazon Echo, Hubs like Revolv and maybe Apple s HomeKit. The notification part is necessary, but can be annoying. All in all - fantastic product. 
4155 These are well made accessories. If you have a polaroid cube you will need the tripod mount and a 1/4 20 camera mount adapter for some of the attachments. 
4156 Plastic price and plactic piece. 
4157 It s working excellently and I can recharge it at anytime rather than wait for it to get low.. 
4158 I gave this as a gift to my darling daughter. She was very pleased and I liked it as well. The package came intact and quickly. Thank you kindly. 
4159 Works perfectly, just what I needed 
4160 The Package I received didnt had the screw to be used to mount the go Pro. I have highlighted it in the image. 
4161 Perfect, as I expected 
4162 As described! 
4163 very happy 
4164 Good 
4165 Improved my product photography. Had to learn the right settings on my camera, but worth it. 
4166 So happy I came across this. Item functions as described. Always wanted to be able to geo-tag my photos. Excited that I got it for the right price. Thanks Amazon! 
4167 Works great on my Sony A6000! 
4168 Awesome 
4169 Good tripod 
4170 I follow the instructions and removed an anoying dusy particle always showing in my sony nexus camera photos 
4171 Love it, looks great and has held up well. 
4172 great camera, when I need additional wide angles, I m coming back! 
4173 Worked perfectly 
4174 Its nice value for money 
4175 work great. Fair price..Just dont have motion detectors. 
4176 love it, had to buy more! 
4177 Cleaned fine. Didn t fix the problem with the camera. 
4178 LOVE IT 
4179 Exactly what I wanted. A similar cable would not let me download my photos directly from my camera. This one works. 
4180 Received as described. Works fine. 
4181 Great quality, easy to use, perfect beginner camera 
4182 Walter with their tech support group helped me find an IP conflict on my router because I (evidently) didn t reserve the camera IPs in my router and my printer took over the IP address. 
4183 Much better than the standard battery. 
4184 Easy to apply 
4185 100% necessary if you have a GoPro. Nothing is worse than getting to your destination and finding that the battery you had in the camera has died. Great replacement for OEM GoPro batteries. 
4186 Cons : 1 - Flamsy. 2 - No .. including. 3 - bad full rig. Pros : 1 - Great price. 2 - Get the job done. 
4187 This item worked perfectly. My lens look like new!!! 
4188 The cord doesn t support I-TTL for my D7200 and any of my flashes however it triggers the flash just fine in manual mode. Will make a good back up for my radio triggers just in case. 
4189 Has worked very well with my Canon T3. Very happy with the product and price. 
4190 The charger stopped working after 6-months. How do I utilize the 1-year manufacture s warranty if I can t get any contact information for the company who makes the unit? It was purchased 10/21/2014. 
4191 Good for short to medium range. If you need to spot target shots past 100 yards this won t do, but anything shorter it is fine. Also used to look at the moon on a clear night and works very well. 
4192 Great photo tool. Getting some great portraits out of it. 
4193 Works perfectly, and shipped quickly! 
4194 Nice filters 
4195 works perfectly, easy to set your own code 
4196 These films are AMAZING they are SO stylish and leave your eyes with love the rainbow and stained glass were my. Personal favorite and candy pop was good too☺☺☺😍 
4197 Nice lens and filters. Cover for lens is a little bit less, and I cannot put lens there. Tripod doesnot hold anything, but it is not bid deal. I am glad that I bought that lens with these accessories 
4198 Good 
4199 good stuff. Quick, easy and made for fun 
4200 it really floats, its light and usefull 
4201 Pure Junk. 
4202 Product works just fine 
4203 I don t know why this has negative reviews. I think it s great. Mine works just fine. 
4204 the app is killing the quality of this product. it slows down the video as i move it. Sometimes the cam will stop. 
4205 Super fast service, item was exactly what I needed. 
4206 works great cheap price 
4207 These batteries work great. Best alternative to the much more expensive canon brand. 
4208 Just what I needed! 
4209 Nice camera, auto-focus doesn t work great but I bought it for manual focus use. Nice sharp pictures, fairly easy to use. Battery lasts for 4 or 5 long outings. 
4210 I thank you very much I use this all the time I make my videos. 
4211 My favorite purchase ever! 
4212 great ITEM THANKS 
4213 Fast shipping!! Everithing that was on the list came in the box!! Ever item in good condition!! Enjoying it!!! The camara is amazing!!! 
4214 Perfect for selfie addict like me.lol...The mounting part is very handy and i like the idea of using remote control on taking pictures..Very nice! I gave 4 stars since I received the product without battery for remote control. But everything works fine for me. 
4215 Well it works, but ive noticed that most of the time its a bit blurry. Depends on what your looking at i guess. 
4216 I only managed to get one session from this when the screw from the ball joint came out. Tried screwing back in and there no threading at all. 
4217 Working with no problems 
4218 I like it very much. I wanted to carry binoculars while backpacking, but I couldn t find a light enough pair. This will let me scope out the land without the weight. The description failed to 
4219 Camera works well, easy to setup. 
4220 its awesome 
4221 The little accessory looks great and adds a wonderful &#34;feel&#34; to the shutter release function. there is no going back once you have experienced it. 
4222 great product at a remarkably low price. Being able to focus at 0.5 meters is great for insect watching. 
4223 The joint isn t strong enough to use on my Harley. The vibrations are just too much. Probably great for a mountain bike or road bicycle, but not for a vibration machine like a Harley. 
4224 This cap will stay on. 
4225 I bought this as a gift for my husband. My husband was very doubtful but once he started using he loved it too! The pictures come out looking great! 
4226 Replaced the originally item only to find out the replacement is just as bad. The adjustment dial doesn t not change. 
4227 Not too bad, fits perfectly on my 22&#34; Paul Buff beauty dish! 
4228 OK --but tight 
4229 Perfect choice for the perfect camera. Good product with a good price. 
4230 These batteries cost a fraction of what an original GoPro battery cost. It comes with a charging dock and cable. The quality of the cell is very comparable to that of an original go pro battery. 
4231 Good product for price, only thing I could complain about is the siamese cable not as durable as I would like. System itself is very good. Cameras have good range, night vision good, very simple to install. Very satisfied and will be ordering the additional 4 cameras soon. 
4232 Images were not sharp at any distance, with and without a tripod. The original lens came with original Kit was excellent. I am returning it. 
4233 love it 
4234 Product was exactly as described and at a great price and very fast delivery !!! Will be back to this sellers page !!! 
4235 Alvin Matthews Excelent Help! It is good to speak with someone that is professional and patient too. 
4236 Light and excellent purchase. It arrived in perfect shape and works better than expected. Totally recommended. Ergonomic design and awesome touch screen. 
4237 All I can say is for the money wow what nice video comparing to my friendsthathavethe go pro I am glad I bought this all the accesories that came with it made it even a better deal.. 
4238 The battery dies quickly and it constantly has to be re-programmed. It goes with the the old saying &#34;You get what you pay for.&#34; 
4239 This is an amazing camera. I am so impressed with the quality of the photos, which I believe are equal to what is produced by my Canon DSR EOS. Great zoom on this too. 
4240 This is a great camera and so much fun to have instant photos to view and share with friends. 
4241 Good enough. I liked it. 
4242 Smooth transaction. Fast shipping. A+++. Thanks!!! 
4243 dont hold a charge for long. 
4244 No more worries about charging up my battery before I go out to take photos. I can shoot replace, shoot replace and go all day. 
4245 This was a hit at my party. Love it. 
4246 Great little lens for the price! Very sharp images. Very well-built lens 
4247 Good Product. Fast Service 
4248 A big hit with our family &#62; the older ones enjoy the views and the younger ones like having the ease of sharing their favorite photos beyond the usual social media sites. 
4249 The battery arrived as expected and I am using it in my camera 
4250 I love this camera. it takes amazing pictures is really durable and is great for vlogging which is essentially why I bought it! 
4251 these are a nice addition I would tell a friend 
4252 Very easy to use! I like it! 
4253 Theses cameras and the system were easy to install and it has a lot of nice features. The clarity of the cameras are great. I would definitely buy from this company again. 
4254 Not sturdy enough to move around, however it did the trick for the occasion... Good for the value and prime shipping was a bonus 
4255 GREAT LITTLE BATTERY S FOR MY CANON 
4256 The best point and shoot out there. I am a photographer and I love carrying this around with me on the go to take photos with if I don t want to lug around all my lenses and equipment. 
4257 Needs much brighter lights. 
4258 Almost everything my daughter needed for her GoPro! 
4259 Worked well for over a year, but recently we lost 2 ports on the DVR, followed by another 2 - cannot be used and do not offer a signal 
4260 Don t fit good even though size is correct 
4261 great price and good product. it gives extra protection. 
4262 Great product 
4263 So heavy! 
4264 Better safe than sorry and this rainsleeve gives me peace of mind knowing my camera is protected. 
4265 Life saver!! This has been an excellent purchase for me because I always have a battery back up ready to go. I use an adaptor often to plug into the wall. 
4266 I think this is a great starter kit for a low price. I m enjoying it. 
4267 works great, good deal for the money 
4268 Fantastic product, incredible technology. I was concerned about battery life based upon some reviews but have found this to be a non-issue. Only regret is that I did not purchase more cameras with my initial system purchase! 
4269 Broke the first time my 5y/o used it 
4270 Great Kit... As advertise.. and arrive on time. 
4271 Works just as described. 
4272 Less than a year old and will not charge to full capacity. Doesn t last very long. After charging overnight it only had about 30 minutes of charge. 
4273 The head is plastic and not capable of holding a DSLR. Legs are fine, but the head is overrated. Maybe for a dinky little point and shoot it would make a decent travel tripod., but that s about all. 
4274 Cool Kit, Comes with a lot of stuff 
4275 great lens for macro photography or portraits 
4276 Love it 
4277 no work for me 
4278 Love this. Video is excellent, sound is also high quality. The time lapse mode is awesome. Love that the wifi will send updates to the camera automatically without having to plug it in anywhere. Battery life is pretty low, but I was expecting that and got two extra. 
4279 Excellent filters at an amazing price. 
4280 All good thanks 
4281 It works 
4282 The focus does not seem to always be in focus once you zoom the lens. Otherwise small, compact and easy to use. 
4283 Excellent item 
4284 Exact l y what I needed 
4285 Took me a while to put together. No manual 
4286 It was just what I wanted! Compact and sturdy. 
4287 Great for controlling the flash gun beam in a pinch 
4288 not very stable... loose between clicks, but it does the job. 
4289 This lens! If you re looking at it and can afford it, you will never regret it. Just amazing and clear!! 
4290 This was to replace the pistol grip on my Sunpak tripod. Works fine but didn t realize that the plate wasn t a quick release like others but really not a problem to turn the base plate knob to remove. 
4291 The shield fits nice in the camera To be honest u don t no that it s really their, Nice product The small one for the top of my d7100 also fits nice 
4292 Thank you would buy again 
4293 The best shotgun mic on the market! 
4294 So far so good...used them for an even this past wkend, very pleased. 
4295 So far I love it. I had no problem connecting to WiFi. The pictures are great. The battery lasted 8 days of my 10 day vacation. It was nice to have a second battery all ready to go. 
4296 Olukai are THE best ! 
4297 Fits perfectly on my new Olympus OM-D E-M5 mk II. Install was easy and the fit is perfect. I couldn t tell that I had the Expert Shield installed. 
4298 item delivered on time and perfect 
4299 Best PTZ camera for this money 
4300 Amazing 
4301 I was hoping a new charger would solve my battery problems and I was correct. My charger was delivered on time and I m very happy with the product. 
4302 Works great 
4303 Perfect for my lenses which don t come with a pouch. Enough protection to store in a backpack. 
4304 Like all Pelican cases; this is well worth the price. 
4305 Excellent quality, highly recommended 
4306 fair case with cutouts for separate compartments. not very padded for protection on the bottom,otherwise nice storage case that fits all go pro and other small pov cameras! 
4307 One battery charged and performed adequately, but one battery would not charge and caused a &#34;battery not compatible&#34; error. 
4308 We used this selfie tool once and liked it so much. Easy to handle, extend to full length that we could easily take 12 people selfie. It is convenient to have small Bluetooth controller. We are satisfied with this product. 
4309 Instruction are only in chinese. I am wondering how to conect it. 
4310 Its ok-I wouldnt tell anybody not to buy this product 
4311 Outstanding. Witty, clear instructions. Very simple to apply. Fits perfectly. I m a fan 
4312 Great for the price! Will be buying more! 
4313 I would never buy again. The only reason I didn t return is because I ran wire around my home. Never again 
4314 Like it. 
4315 a real walk-about-lens great build very sharp. 
4316 Great Product. Just as describe! Will buy again! 
4317 Cheap and hideous 
4318 Lost my original charger and this works perfectly! 
4319 was easy to set up, we are easily able to connect to the security camera with android and windows devices from home or wherever and quickly see the footage at our storefront even at night. 
4320 ewery thing was fine thank you 
4321 My copy of this adapter was a bit tight on the lens side which I m okay with. x mount end is a little sloppy on to the camera body. It doesn t seem to cause any issues, however. But I ll dock a point for being not quite perfect. 
4322 Super smooth, solid, and the price is great. I tried out another more expensive slider first and I couldn t stand it--glad I tried out Konovo. 
4323 Great Buy ! 
4324 The tension pieces broke the first time I put it on the camera. Now it s useless. 
4325 The quality of the picture is very poor. My iPhone s camera takes better pictures. 
4326 Best action camera on the market PERIOD....I own two no name and all four &#34;competition&#34; to go pro ...with the mounts with all it can do with its app nothing COMES CLOSE!!!! so nice now I need 3 more and a 3 gimbal and underwater mounts ;) 
4327 Good product at an excellent price. Very Quick shipping. Would buy from again 
4328 This is a great unit for the car. It s the perfect size. It s very sturdy 
4329 Works perfectly right out of the box for my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook Pro. A lifesaver on a long plane flight 
4330 package was delivered 
4331 Very compact and versatile. Works well with my sony a6000 
4332 GREAT LENS .. I USE THIS LENS FOR EVERY THING.. 
4333 totally and completely worthless. extremely unstable. check out the how small the legs are. unless you are using a tiny COMPACT mini camera it will cost you a broken camera. MOST IMPORTANTLY THE SELLER IS TERRIBLE. RESTOCKING CHARGES AND AN ATTITUDE MAKES YOU WISH YOU NEVER BOUGHT FROM THIS SELLER. 
4334 Well made bag! Perfect for my needs. If you have a huge camera with a long lens, you might want to look at Tamrac s larger bag. But for someone like me, it is the PERFECT bag. Holds my Canon 70D and 4 lens with no problem. 
4335 excellent 
4336 I like having extra mounts, everything fit s and work s great 
4337 Sharp as can be but hunts a little. Overall a very nice lens 
4338 Easy to use. Great 
4339 I am pleased enough that I am planning on buying more, this time with Bluetooth. 
4340 Works great. Good price good quality. 
4341 nice 
4342 Doesn t live up to it s billing. I returned the lens in question 
4343 Bought for camera and so happy I did! 
4344 All camera functions work, battery indicator always blinks as low battery; perhaps it needs just a little more power 
4345 I think this is a cool idea. It s small, takes seconds to set up and it has the dusk feature for 4 or 7 hours, Helps make the house look like someone is home with little power usage. 
4346 great looking FAKE camera. really easy to install, looks real. comes with flashing red light( if you install AA batteries). 
4347 Pleasantly surprised at quality 
4348 I am blown away by how high end this tripod looks and feels. Better than I expected. Holds my T5i with battery grip and 75-300mm very secure. 
4349 great camera 
4350 good backdrop lights are okay--- wish I would have got the LED- screwing 5 bulbs into 3 bases makes them NOT really portable--- GO LED 
4351 Camera is what was described. I love the zoom. Great price! 
4352 OMG ! It s too cute ! Love it so much ~ HelloKitty fans Must have item 
4353 Broke after a week 
4354 Exactly what I thought it would be. I am satisfied with this product. 
4355 Best investment I made........Works great when you re taking sports pictures and it also works with your auto focus motor 
4356 Just what I needed, priced resonable and shipping wasn t outragous. 
4357 great idea 
4358 One of the nicest/most quality lens pens that I ve ever purchased. Great buy! 
4359 Thank you... Now I can download my pics from my New camera 
4360 Very good made. I recommend this product. 
4361 Fits perfect while still easy to remove scope cover, I m really happy we added it to the purchase of our scope 
4362 works great 
4363 The item was perfect and delivered on time 
4364 I love the interchangability of these flaps - great idea. 
4365 Great, secure fit! Worth the extra money. 
4366 The end connecting into the camera is not as snug as I think it should be, but it works fine. Just need to handle camera more carefully and watch that connection is still in place. 
4367 Constant issue with the power supply 
4368 Crapy product. Save your money and get a promaster. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008SSMYZ0?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00 
4369 Had I realized about the vector effect, would have purchased a round rubber flexible hood which is what I had before 
4370 very good 
4371 Works Perfect. 
4372 Nice product 
4373 Quality charger. Happy with purchase. 
4374 Everything was shipped safely and in good order and for such a bargain price. 
4375 Great battery Good price!!! 
4376 I had this one month, everything was great, then the tilt stop working, I hope they will make it good without me having to ship it back to China. Otherwise I would of rated it 5 stars. 
4377 Awesome camera. You have to learn how to use it for sure but it takes really nice pics. 
4378 perfect for what i wanted 
4379 Fits my Nikon 300mm 2.8 vr 2 
4380 Just installed. Good product! 
4381 Lighter than the GoPro and image quality just the same. 
4382 LCD quality is very low, contrast is very bad using with my GH4, don t recommend it much. 
4383 Thank you product works good. 
4384 Windows 7 professional 64 bit, right clicked the install file &#62;properties &#62;compatibility &#62;check run in windows 98 compatibility mode. Once the software is installed, set your USB to Serial adapter to Com 1. It worked right away. Took control over the built in hand controller. This is very cool. 
4385 Good 
4386 Wasn t loud at all, could barely hear it 
4387 Gift for granddaughter. No info yet on performance. 
4388 I was unable to mount a speed light on the grip so with the zoom device it made it easier plus having a PC connector available. 
4389 Great BUDGET lense for the price! Works great on a Canon Digital Rebel XT. 
4390 The view is decent at night but blurry during the day even when it is adjusted for focus 
4391 Lens worked great with canon 70d or Apsc camera, this doesn t work on full frame canon 5d mark III camera 
4392 I love this camera. It is small enough to fit in my purse and works great! 
4393 Great set. Works great with my GoPro Hero 4 Silver. Nice fitting chest mount and head mount. Extra screw is nice as well and fits everything, including other official GoPro mounts I have. I would highly recommend this, especially at a great price. 
4394 Great for the price 
4395 Great product. For once, I have more pockets than stuff! 
4396 This is a very nice lens cap for the price. The fit is better than with the oem in my personal opinion. Shipping time to the U.S. is not the best with any of the current sellers, however. 
4397 Fantastic. Did not expect this to be so good. But there is always a flaw to a product and it is the microphone when on a the bike mount. 
4398 Very good camera. Reacts quickly and smoothly through wifi. Clear image. 2 way audio if very good 
4399 This is decent for quick review of 35mm slides and negatives. I wouldn t use it to gauge colors. 
4400 They work as advertised. Clean eyeglasses and screens well. Fiber pieces big enough to actually hold in your hand unlike the itty bitty cloths that you get with eyeglasses. 
4401 It was a quick, easy setup. It worked great the first time and seems fairly durable. 
4402 Fantastic. I shot a movie and tossed this critter in my bag and used it as an eye light and as a computer light. Dang thing runs forever! (or so it seems) 
4403 A great lens for macro as well as general photography. It produces a very sharp image. I have found my normal lens for the Nikon D3200. 
4404 It is a good complement for your camera specially if you like to take couple pictures in a trip. 
4405 Nice!!!! 
4406 Use these all the time 
4407 awesome! 
4408 Works as advertised 
4409 Basic yet adequate product 
4410 It works as suggested by the other reviews. 
4411 Nice 
4412 great lens clothes, just the right size 
4413 This is a genuine Canon battery and works perfectly in my Canon T6s camera. I think you should always have a charged spare battery on hand when on a photographic trip to avoid the sad event of a power failure. 
4414 I really like the effects of this lens. At 10 stops, my dSLR can literally see nothing through the viewfinder. Please pardon the Spinal Tap reference. I could not help myself. 
4415 you push it to turn it on and off! very convenient 
4416 I found this product to be very flimsy without much padding to protect my camera and lenses. It is also lacking in pocket space. I have a case that is half the size with many more pockets and thick padding and I fit more things in it. 
4417 It is so hard to find a strap for my semi-compact Canon camera, and this is the best you can get imo. I really love it! 
4418 Excellent product.... Technology is super.... Ease of use is outstanding... It s a ready to go unit in a box... Compare it to a High End Security service... Security service would cost a minimum of 2k... Believe me, I priced them!!!! 
4419 Perfect and great... 
4420 Product arrived as described in a timely manner. I ll gladly buy again for future lens cap needs. Recommend. 
4421 Pro: - works very well Cons: - it drains the battery 
4422 excellent 
4423 Terrible product, too many problems to waste my time writing about it ,no customer service ,just find another company then Lorex , and I don t normally write a 1 star review but this product and company did it .... 
4424 this bag was a really nice bag... lots of pockets.. just not big enough for what I needed 
4425 Was an excellent purchase. Love it! 
4426 If you re a Pro. Don t do it. Spend the extra money for the Canon. I should have just thrown $70 down the toilet. Live and Learn... 
4427 I absolutely love this lens. I am still a newbie w/ DSLR. And this lens has made me so comfortable behind the lens. It has to be my favorite. 
4428 Love this! Awesome product Love this! Awesome product.Does the job perfectly. Fast delivery. Quick and easy to assemble, works great! Highly recommended! 
4429 if you own a camera and it taiks these batteries ... then its the perfect buy... has saved my many times when one battery dies and your still wanting to take pics 
4430 Did not fit my lenses. The adapter fit into my camera body fine, but the lens mount was wrong. Ended up returning. 
4431 intake, compression, power and exhaust 
4432 Perfect 
4433 Love this collection. Good quality - came faster than expected. Very nice. 
4434 Great camera and cost/benefit for the kit. It really worths it. 
4435 excellent product. 
4436 Just got my camera hooked up. The technician was very awesome! CASE#C6728526; AR004246, ALDY; Kyle, Case#C6728562; AR#AR004218 
4437 CHEAP quality.. almost a toy. buy something better. 
4438 Very cheap quality. It wasnt out of the box and it was broken! DO NOT WASTE YOUR 11 DOLLARS JUST MAKE THE INVESTMENT IN A GOOD TRIPOD!!! 
4439 Very Good 
4440 These thing is cool with alot of upgrades to be done. 
4441 this does not work well, the setup is confusing the company will charge you to help set it up. I did get it to work after 4 hours but the recording process stinks. I don t recommend this product at all 
4442 Nice, cheap, and works well. 
4443 Great IP cameras for around the house. Will FTP snap shots or full HD video (720p) to any FTP server. 
4444 Awesome camera has multiple filters for one shot and uses some different angles for one shot. and capture photos very well. 
4445 Excellent and fast shipping! 
4446 This was a great replacement to my lence. although it is a little loose, it does the job. 
4447 Awesome first stage of alert. 
4448 Love it 
4449 Received it and found all these white marks on it. Looks like chalk 
4450 Nice power box with plenty of capacity. 
4451 Love the go pro!! My kids love it more 
4452 Nice product and good quality. Delivery was way to slow. 
4453 Highly recommend. 
4454 Very smooth gearing - and mounts nicely on tripod. 
4455 I am writing this review regarding the excellent service I received from Titathink Support Service. Taylor was able to help me correct my problem very efficiently and with excellent customer service I will purchase more products from Titathink. 
4456 Henry, Thank you very much for helping me set up my foscam! Very easy and simple. 
4457 Came in time and as advertised. 
4458 did not use this camera , sent it back , wrong type 
4459 Fits and works as expected. 
4460 Just what I was seeking at a fair price 
4461 Exquisite B&W film..use it with old school fold out Polaroids...awesome results..! 
4462 Great little camera. Very clear images. Zoom is great. This my second one exactly the same because my first one got wet (stupid me!!) and stopped working. Had to have exact same one because I liked it so much. 
4463 Nice unit, but range is 50-75 feet 
4464 Not much to say excapt taht it works well and is priced right. Now I have an extra one that I keep at work. 
4465 Well made, just what I have come to expect from Neewer 
4466 This is a great lens for the price. I used it to take pictures while traveling and found the long zoom capability to be very handy. The pictures that I took came out beautifully! 
4467 Much smaller than its seems but I m a short girl so it looks nice on me! 
4468 A great bargain for a good camera! 
4469 Great accessories for your Go Pro and it all comes in a nice case. 
4470 Excellent quality, highly recommended 
4471 Bought this for my daughter and she loves it! 
4472 Love these!! They re amazing and so dependable!! 
4473 A great buy. The charge last a long time. 
4474 Great camera ...great pictures 
4475 excelent 
4476 more features than I can figure out how to use. still learning how to make it go. 
4477 Works pretty good for the price Can see a black ring around the edge unless you zoom a little on the phone. Used on iPhone 6 and droid turbo 
4478 this is my first tripod 
4479 i just recently opened a youtube page and needed it 
4480 its awesome thanks https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1J5rgMIfqZJkJDL--JoA6Q 
4481 Bought this a while back and it has been my prime lens ever since, the quality of it is amazing photos are so clear even in low light i completely recommend this lens 
4482 Works but it s stuck on my Nikon. 
4483 TAKES GREAT PICTURES AND EASY TO USE. 
4484 Easy to set up! Picture quality is better than average! Can t beat the price! 
4485 Works well and looks good. Quick delivery from seller and very good to deal with. Highly recommend 
4486 These are okay. Only really get tood shots from exactly head on :/ 
4487 works great 
4488 Very handy to have while swimming 
4489 Great product 
4490 Functions exactly as advertised 
4491 It is a good case 
4492 Im very unhappy with these batteries I purchase them months a go for backup never charging them until I was ready for my vacation and they fail. They did not hold the charge. I charge them the night before and then when to use them two dudes. 
4493 The strap broke immediately and the last 3 (of an expensive roll of film -only 12 photos) did not print out. Instructions on the &#34;lighting&#34; button on camera would have been preferred. 
4494 Great value, has everything you need for your gopro! 
4495 Good Product Works as expected 
4496 it s a D 80.. What more to day. 
4497 Great plan for 3 years. Hope I never have to use it but if I do then I will give a follow up. 
4498 Excellent 
4499 great little case for GoPro hero 4 but ordered a bigger one because it hold very little accessories. 
4500 replacement as advertised 
4501 Really helpful!! Love it 
4502 Doesn t fit the Polaroid camera very well, the camera turns on when put in the case. The Polaroid printer fits perfect. 
4503 Great price and they actually work! I ve used my batteries for a year and they work as good as the original... and they are mysteriously exactly like the OEM version. ;) 
4504 fabric is much lighter than show. It s pastel blue instead of the deep blue with dark accents. Very disappointed! 
4505 good battery power for my camera 
4506 The recipient, inasmuch as it was a gift, expressed his full satisfaction; that has not always been his practice as a response 
4507 Easy to connect to Smartthings, works great so far in a garage. 
4508 Love it..Great Product...Thanks 
4509 I have used this in two full cycle and both of them were just as good as the Nikon OEM s. With the way I used it, shooting and reviewing on the LCD, it shot 1,000 clicks and there was still 25% charge left. 
4510 Great product and fantastic customer service. I recommend! 
4511 This is the worst camcorder that I could ever imagine. 
4512 Love this Camera, decent priced and works great! 
4513 nice for the price 
4514 Good protection for long lens circular polarizers. 
4515 These little mounts are very versatile and they re a good thing to have in your camera bag/backpack. Great buy! 
4516 Great for super long exposures! 
4517 Got one just before leaving on a trip. Love the collapsible build. Like being able to just push it back instead of remove, turn around and screw back on. Worked well. 
4518 The batteries have a high self-discharge rate. After a week of non use, they need to be recharged. 
4519 Good Camera, Fast Shipping 
4520 A great case! 
4521 good product. Case very large 
4522 Well made and useful as a spare. 
4523 protects lenses nicely 
4524 Very poor image but great sound!!! 
4525 Everythings fits well. I wouldn t use this case for air travel but for storage, vehicle travel it works just fine 
4526 it works as long as you don t try to go over 5 feet.. 
4527 Works well and a great price. 
4528 POOR QUALITY, SOMETIMES IT WILL SYNCHRONIZE WITH THE CAMERA, OTHERS DONT !! DONT BUY THIS !! 
4529 works great for what we need it for :) 
4530 Jonathan Reed from foscam tech support was a great help, friendly and very knowledgeable. This was the second time that I have used the tech support and they have always been very helpful and solved my issues quickly. Love the cameras too! 
4531 The screen was scratched. 
4532 I still use it and it works great!!!! 
4533 Has a cheap quality to it but it gets the job done! I use it with my HOLGA and have not had any issues with it. 
4534 thanks 
4535 great bag and sturdy with lots of room for dslr, lenses accessories and an iPad. 
4536 Great Product!!! fast Shipping!! 
4537 This thing works, easy to setup but not great. The sensor was too sensitive even at the lowest setting that the reflection of the beam on my car did not trip the sensor causing the gate to continue opening slamming into the side of my car. 
4538 Used these on safari in Tanzania. I was amazed at how well the worked. We compared the glasses to another rated the same and these out performed them and we were all amazed. 
4539 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083WYDAU 
4540 Everything fine, useful as expected & good delivery service... First one came with a little failure, then I returned it and get a new one with no issue until today... 
4541 As expected 
4542 Nice product--good price 
4543 Great product.... 
4544 A high quality product with a great warranty. You won t be disappointed! 
4545 It was just what I wanted. 
4546 great product 
4547 I need batteries to last for over 8 hours, and these batteries go strong days after. They re perfect for a camera flash where I need a quick refresh rate to fire off a flash as needed. Paired with the Powerex charger, these are a must have. 
4548 It does the job..... 
4549 Image quality is poor on any setting. Action shots are impossible to achieve. 
4550 Great 
4551 Works so so... you need to be on ice if you ever want it that smooth if you get my drift! enjoy the bumpy footage! 
4552 Pins all bent up. Two sockets missing two pins each! 
4553 Great customer service and product is made out of superior materials. 
4554 Works exactly like the original 
4555 Works as well as the original GoPro camera batteries 
4556 Just like the originals, now the kayak has what it needs. 
4557 All accessories seem to be of good quality and function properly with my GoPro 3+ silver. Can t beat it for the price. 
4558 Awesome scope, with it s uniform size, not tapered, you can attach a green laser to sight in where you want to view, I just used rubber bands 
4559 excellent 
4560 fits well 
4561 Great purchase. Works well. 
4562 Not A mirror, very small , very low quality 
4563 I don t like typing 
4564 Nikon quality as expected. 
4565 They are really cheap batteries. They do not last 10 to fifteen shots. waste of money 
4566 Love it.works easy. 
4567 Works great! Nice clarity! Great Price! 
4568 A good price. Now I have a few spare covers at the same price as buying a single cover at the store. 
4569 Fantastic Product. Aperture ring is not so precise, but still manageable 
4570 i love it! 
4571 Great little accessory for my iPad. Great close up photos. 
4572 great item 
4573 It works very well!!!! A++++++!!!! 
4574 Kids can break just about anything. However this helicopter is easier to navigate than others. Its durable and can take some pretty bad falls or crashes. In the situation that my kid does break it. Its super cheap to be replaced. 
4575 Perfect for what I needed 
4576 It s an ok telescope, design is great and compact and easy to use. 
4577 These came without all parts. It said in the listing there was no manual, so I was expecting that.I was not expecting it to come with no peer sources. I had to ship it back 
4578 This is the perfect match to the LX 100 – it s fit and finish match and it even fits in the leather case. 
4579 i love it...as expected 
4580 Awesome , work great charge fast 
4581 Amazing for what it is. Definitely one of my smarter purchases. Does pretty much everything and offers as much as the gopro for a third of the cost! 
4582 But unfortunately I had to return the item because I received a new camera for my Birthday 
4583 Really good camera. Fast delivery 
4584 It was easy to setup and video quality is very good. 
4585 Great little camera! Fit perfectly on my 230 and 250 quadcopters and added very little weight! Can plug straight into fatshark or immersionrc transmitter. Good picture quality for fpv. 
4586 It works amazingly and the amount of light that it puts off is great. 
4587 GREAT CASE 
4588 Very good case for the Sony A6000. A kittle tight and a bit difficult to put and take off, But it works for me. 
4589 GREAT PRODUCT. RECOMENDT IT. 
4590 It is everything I have been looking for. Great for telescope. It makes my cell phone a mini TV 
4591 It appears to be a well made filter, Works awesome with clarity..I recommend it... 
4592 Awesome! Just like OEM batteries, if not better. You just can t beat the price!! 
4593 really good, only one time allmost loose it, 100m altitud and do not respond get back home!!! 
4594 Exactly as I expected.[[ASIN:B00NIYJKL0 GoPro HERO4 Dual Battery Charger + Battery for HERO4]] 
4595 Excellent alternative to cable tethering... Have to get used to the lag time when shooting Raw but a necessity for location shooting and really sets you free in the studio. Great advantage shooting to an iPad for client involvement and approval. If you shoot tethered... It s a must have. 
4596 Great to have for surveying and inspections, bought several to have when needed. 
4597 popped right on, works great!! 
4598 If you need it, you ll love it. Otherwise, its another piece of gear looking for a use. I thought needed it, but by the time it arrived I had found a better solution to my problem. Still, its likely to be useful in studio photography. 
4599 Quality is not bad. Good lights. Easy setup. 
4600 Works Great 
4601 It is a tripod - does everything I expected it to do 
4602 It says on the site that it is compatible with the T5i but in the book that comes with the remote it does not say it is compatible and I cannot get it to connect to my camera. 
4603 good clean product. I wasn t sure what to expect but after receiving the package and using the cloth on my glasses, I glad I purchased them. I gave one to my wife, I have one in my vehicle and in my backpack. I expect to purchase another order soon. 
4604 Used this accessories kit to go cliff jumping and atv riding. Never have problems 
4605 really good quality 
4606 the night view is very good, I can see my Sofa so clearly, also my door 
4607 Fun, fun, fun! If you love bokeh and want to experiment, this lens is for you! Play and have fun and expand your creativity. 
4608 Do it - this has been great! 
4609 Not really satisfied. I m not recommend this product to anyone. Usable, but not even good made, especially all bolts what you use to keep your go pro firmly. 
4610 It does exactly what it is supposed to do. 
4611 Inexpensive, reasonably well constructed, works brilliantly (also very light weight). Given the battery life in an A6000, two are a requirement, and being able to charge both simultaneously saves getting up in the middle of the night to swap batteries into the charger. 
4612 So awesome to have another battery ready to go. These are working great. Recommended. 
4613 Git it on time. Everything as written came.Learning to use, but like it so far. 
4614 I was really happy with this purchase and made a review regarding the quality of all the accessories. The only accessory that I think is not so great is the monopod/selfie stick. Here is the link to my review on this purchase. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzvifJOyfac 
4615 This is just the right combination of super optics, travel size and affordable price. There was no perceptible difference between these and Leica in terms of clarity and ease of use. It is super easy to adjust thr focus by turning just one knob. 
4616 see pics. that s a dell e7440 and Sony a55 w/ 16-105 zoom lens. 
4617 Its good but it tend to turn off my screen on Nikon d5500 when I use it. There is a feature on my camera when something cover certain spot, I can t view my viewfinder at all. 
4618 This harness was great. It was easily adjustable and fit both my 18 pound Beagle and my 23 pound mutt perfectly! 
4619 It s the most useful thing I have purchased in a while. 
4620 so great to use them 
4621 I`m using all these pieces and there is a great difference no using them. Filters are very useful for specific pictures, anyway you have to be patience for selecting the right moment with the right place with the right filter. Good lenses for taking pictures of insects. 
4622 Was better than expected, solid, and compact enough to transport. 
4623 Works fantastic and it s exactly what I expected 
4624 Absolutely worth it... Grabbed one of these to keep an eye on our dogs! Took less than 2 min to set up! I will be adding a few more of these once our house gets built. Great for security as well. 
4625 haven t really used them yet, tested them they all work, were shipped on time, so far I think they will work great. 
4626 Looks just like picture. It is perfect for any size cell phones. 
4627 I bought this for my Husband for his birthday And he had yet to put it down..he takes it everywhere 
4628 Excellent design. Can carry a lot of gear for the size. A bit over priced. 
4629 The photo is a bit red. It is all godd! 
4630 Great Item! Would buy again. Did not disappoint. 
4631 Monopod is useful for a video camcorder. Tripod camera mount plate/plastic clamp is so weak YOUR EXPENSIVE DSLR WILL FALL RIGHT OFF! You ve been warned. This is an imported piece of trash that is an expensive mistake! 
4632 Surprisingly simple and reliable 
4633 wy too small to use with a selfie stick! will work if you use the clamp from the stick for your phone or have a camera with a 1/4x20 hole in your device but that s about it. I need something with a wider stance (longer legs). 
4634 GREAT LENS. 
4635 Love it. Great price 
4636 Love the magnetic feet! 
4637 Works as it should (tested as soon as I got it) and the bonus adapter was great when we went to Paris. Unfortunately, I forgot the charger, and the extra battery (original), plus I left the adapter when we checked out of the hotel. :-/ 
4638 I love it 
4639 Works perfectly - much more convenient than the standard cover. And - the camera is not even longer (maybe by half of a milimeter) 
4640 Great product. Larger than I expected but perfect for cleaning for cleaning the screen of my phone and tablet. 
4641 Very bright and clear for day time, easy to use. Pretty powerful even for long distance but don t expect too much. Very good for general use, looking at bugs, butterflies, passing by ships etc. Would be great if the pouch has some extra room. 
4642 Quick shipping. Product works fine. We are powering 3 cameras with it at this time and plan to add more soon. 
4643 I m just a casual picture taker and 99% of the time use the automatic mode. The pics are fantastic. Great clarity, huge rage when zooming, and easy to carry. 
4644 Good tripod but no for heavy cameras 
4645 Thanks so much all products are in good conditions 
4646 Needed another shoe on our Canon C100 cameras for second wireless mics. The 1/4-20 hole at the back of the handle is the perfect spot and this shoe fits the bill. I bought 4, one for each camera. Why did we suffer so long without these? 
4647 Based on past experience, this sort of battery charger may be more apt to fail with heavy use; however this charger works well and, hopefully, will last a long time. 
4648 Not for heavy cameras. It will work perfect with light DSLR cameras and point and shoot cameras. 
4649 I bought two extras of these to glue together for lens organization in my bag. 
4650 Great for what its meant for. Make sure you clean the camera with rubbing alcohol before you stick this on. Used on my RX100 M2. Obviously makes the camera thicker. 
4651 works great 
4652 Item came in on time, in tact. Very happy with the product. 
4653 Better than expected. Easy to install and operate. Great system for price 
4654 Sturdy and heavy duty. I can pretty much angle my camera in an direction. This product is very well made! 
4655 Exactly as described. Quality is excellent. 
4656 It s great! 
4657 Works very well. 
4658 Great solid antenna with very good signal expansion compared to stock 
4659 Save your money! This is a piece of junk. The software is terrible and there is NO US support. Try emails to China. Look at the other reviews; all written by the same person. Buy a camera which has a US presence and support. 
4660 Well the build quality was alright but the actual use of this item was horrible. It would slide on its own and hit the insects id try to photograph. do not buy. 
4661 The cap fit very well. I have an old 35mm camera and lost the body cap. I can now shoot film and take my camera out and about 
4662 Just what I wanted. Works well 
4663 Great for boating or the pool. Easy to attach. 
4664 Great quality 
4665 Learning is half of the journey. 
4666 works perfectly 
4667 quickly and very good 
4668 This dash cam has paid for itself when my wife had an accident and it was all on dash cam. Great camara 
4669 Great bag, recommend to all photographers 
4670 Very versatile piece of gear. Protects cameras and lenses well, fits inside most backpacks and messenger bags. Would buy again. 
4671 Works perfectly on my 80lbs Doberman and she barely notices it. Would highly recommend this of the costly GoPro brand dog harness mount 
4672 Great product and a Fair price.. 
4673 Very nice product. It has work really good and the quality of the pictures is the best 
4674 Fast shipping and was exactly as described! 
4675 really if you look closely it looks like false but if you install it on the roof or in a faraway place the camera seem real 
4676 Great starter pack. Gets the chicks panties wet. One mount sucks. 
4677 Battery does not communicate with Nikon charger so you don t know whether it is fully charged. Disappointed. 
4678 A++++ 
4679 I don t like typing 
4680 Much lighter and sturdier than my earlier one, that weighed much more than this. Love it with the Sirui T-1205x 
4681 Inserted the sd card and it got lost in the camera. Had to take camera apart to get it out. Re-inserted, tested camera, and didn t work. Returned camera and sd card. Won t order anything that small again. 
4682 Good items! 
4683 Excellent product - camera fits perfectly! Super fast arrival time too! 
4684 Great product 
4685 The battery I needed for my camera and it works fine. 
4686 My Raspberry Pi is finally able to work with my older big screen. Just had to swap the plugs around to get the picture to display after I forced the Pi to output analog video (under the config file). 
4687 great gift lots of fun 
4688 Awesome with a rigid hinge. Robust better than expected perfect for a gopro or camera gear. 
4689 pretty good, nice kit that comes with a lot. be careful when putting them on though, they can stick really easily and can be nearly impossible to take off 
4690 very good item delivered as expected. 
4691 A perfect product for when you run out of juice. 
4692 Not much to say other than it fits and works perfectly. 
4693 Great! 
4694 One of the green pens is totally dry and doesn t work at all. Out of ten pens, only four show up on a black paper. The box is broken. 
4695 All excellent mounts. It does not use the contour sliding system, instead it uses a standard camera screw. 
4696 Great price and great quality. 
4697 price is very competitive 
4698 Nikon Brand so you know without a doubt....it will work! 
4699 OEM. Lasts forever. Great pricing. 
4700 Looks great, fits perfectly. I have a Canon eos XS and I got some old lenses from a flea market. They are canon FD lenses and everything works great. Just need to clean up my new (old) lenses and I m ready to go 
4701 I have Pelican cases for a lot of valuable equipment. They never let me down. 
4702 Excelent Quality Pictures with this camera, i look like a Pro 
4703 Works perfectly for what I needed. Super clean and tons of gain! 
4704 I stuck this to the tail of my airplane for some amazing in-flight shots. When size and weight are important, this is the one. 
4705 SO GLAD THEY OFFER PAGES TO EXPAND YOUR ALBUM. SO FAR I HAVE EXPANDED 2X AND ROOM FOR MORE IF I NEED TOO. 
4706 Works adequately. 
4707 I use it a lot for the Eagles that I watch and for some motorcycle rides. 
4708 I sent this camera to my son who is out of the country. When he uses wifi all the pictures will go to the cloud. If he loses his camera he will never lose his pictures. He loves this phone. 
4709 As described. Packs into small space. Ideal for macro work. 
4710 These are just what we have been looking for. Right size. Arrived on time. Works perfectly. 
4711 No More VR Issue. I received the lens yesterday without any VR issue. The lens is great. 
4712 These were my first pair of binoculars and man am I impressed. These pull in a lot of light and offer a crystal clear viewing experience. 
4713 Received these today and tried them out and I m very satisfied with the results. 
4714 Good 
4715 Excellent 
4716 Really a professional piece of equipment. Used with cameras of appropriate weight and this is a great tool. I have heavier pro version but don t want to carry on smaller jobs. This I will take everywhere! 
4717 I would like to know if the little screw that s long enough for the P3S is sold anywhere? The one supplied is not long enough to mount to the rc mount to eyelet. 
4718 Very happy with this set. I ve had a lot of fun decorating my pictures! 
4719 Got a couple of these. Both went down within a day of putting them up. I hooked them up to all 5 of my camera systems and they didn t work on any of them. One did last an hour longer than the other. Won t do that again... 
4720 fit perfect, easy to apply. 
4721 I bought this as a Mother s Day present for my wife. She wanted something between a point-and-shoot into DSLR. This fits the bill. 
4722 Nice little kit. its obviously cheap and the the brushes may loose a hair inside your camera from time to time so double check it before you start shooting but otherwise im really happy with it. im not a pro photographer. 
4723 Nifty camera. Great outdoor solution. FREE online storage is a huge plus. Easy setup and surprisingly good battery life. Likely to buy another. 
4724 Money value package 
4725 works well for a novice 
4726 Excellent value at twice the price. Equal to, if not superior in quality and functionality to the camera float manufactured by Olympus. 
4727 Product came as described with all parts in tact. They are fairly sturdy and seem to do a good job. 
4728 Bought this product for my grandson to anchor his gopro to boat motor and it worked great. 
4729 Ball head fully met expectations; it held the camera very securely - could saftly walk with the tripod with the camera locked in place. was easy to adjust, with a time and coarse adjustment capability and scanned smppthly. Nice small size and light weight, 
4730 works as advertised. 
4731 Film in pack didn t always result in good picture. Not sure if it was user error and we exposed film because first picture turned out great. 
4732 This product met advertised specifications and was promptly shipped. However I would recommend spending additional money for brass rings to prevent sticking threads. 
4733 The NIKON LensPen Lens Cleaner works as described, so I am happy with my purchase. 
4734 Wonderful protection, light weight, good harness. 
4735 Came exactly as said and about 2$ cheaper than if I bought it at a store, so I guess it s worth it 
4736 love this camera, battery does seem to lose charge fast. 
4737 On the Nikon J4, the minimal focal distance is closer to a 50mm lens. I love this lens. I intended to upgrade to a full DSLR, but, my J4 is awesome with this lens and the FT1 adapter. 
4738 Accurate reading. Cheap, does what it should 
4739 Nice cover. Fits the A6000 well. I d love a belt strap, but this is a good cover for saving the camera from small dings and dirt. 
4740 Looks great, works great. Not the fastest lens or lowest F-stop, but pictures are clear and focus is quick enough for money spent. 
4741 Great! 
4742 satisfied with the order. the product was exactly as it was described. 
4743 Swivel section will not turn more than a few degrees! Had to move the whole unit to video. 
4744 Just what I was needing for my gimbal 
4745 worked great.....the same as nikon battery. 
4746 Item works great and arrived in a timely matter! 
4747 These seem to work fine. I can t comment on whether they last as long as the original battery. they seem to last a long time. 
4748 The Sony battery is exactly as advertised. Thank you! 
4749 It works perfectly. I really liked being able just to put the battery into the camera without having to power it up first. 
4750 I m a wedding videographer and this is a must have!! 
4751 Not user friendly and the owners manual is worthless. Find another product that is easier to use and more reliable. 
4752 Bought this Hood for my Canon EOS T5i with 18-135mm lens and fits perfectly! Very good quality item! 
4753 Great gear for use. 
4754 Perfect, controls my 560III s power levels remotely. Superb portable lighting setup. 
4755 Quality product. Fast shipping. For Fujifilm XP80 fit. 
4756 Love them, 2nd pair I have owned 
4757 Order arrived as stated on the site; the cameras are great - we are very happy. 
4758 Yes I still do Polaroids 
4759 One of the bulbs was not working. 
4760 It s a flash stand. Therefore, you stick a flash in it and it stands. Done. 
4761 One, two three, I had my cable and it fit perfectly. 
4762 Smaller than advertised :( 
4763 Great quality and is definitely an upgrade from the stock screws. Don t think i ll ever use the stock ones again and will slowly replace all my plastic ones with these. 
4764 Love it 
4765 It charged the battery. 
4766 Not pro quality or durability, but it gets the job done and works well. The reversal cover is a nice solve to the problem of needing to bring several reflectors to a shoot. 
4767 Delivered as advertised. 
4768 Exactly as needed. 
4769 I still have been able to get it to work 
4770 very good quality and very good prices 
4771 Works great 
4772 Very pleased 
4773 Didn t work. Manual had instructions for a different model. Honestly, I wish I had just spent the extra few dollars for a decent one 
4774 heavy, flat look at objects 
4775 Perfect. Brought my camera back to life. 
4776 Easy to use but battery died on me pretty quickly although I hardly used it. Also never learned all its features, my God, why do they put so many features on it. 
4777 Easy to install and works well. You do have to hit # after your code in order to unlock, which is slightly annoying. 
4778 Worked great, easy to install. Great communication. 
4779 Just fits the front of the SB600 but don t stay on..must tape it to keep it from falling off 
4780 Pretty decent monopod, locks function properly, lightweight, stable enough for a Canon Vixia hf 400r camcorder. Not sure if it is up to professional standards but the fluid head pans and tilts smoothly with no discernible drag. Construction and materials are up to par for the price. 
4781 Lena works perfectly for selfies! Couldn t be happier and it snaps on and off seamlessly 
4782 Setup was very simple and once it s configured (in less than 10 minutes) it s very easy to use with the app and web site. 
4783 bob s knobs alwasy good for your telecope. 
4784 Wish it was bigger, but it s tough and very high quality. I store 4 light stands and a soft box in it. It can t take any more than that. 
4785 It s a great product at a great price. I love the bubble levels and the height adjustability. 
4786 I loved this camera and it is a very good one and i think some of you should but it 
4787 Arrived on time. Great package. Some of the items were not really needed, but I am very pleased with the whole transaction. The camera is a great camera for an amateur photographer. I really like the size. I also ordered a 50mm lens for the camera. Have everything I need. 
4788 Worked exactly as expected 
4789 Quality exceeded expectations that were based on price. 
4790 Cool 
4791 Nice case, fits well. Product arrived sooner than expected. 
4792 Fit the lens it was purchased for, seems okay. No distortions. 
4793 Very cool product. I am pleased with my purchase. 
4794 It is good product 
4795 Lens works well.. makes reds pop out..Awesome 
4796 Sets a role model for how flexible gymnasts must be to make it to the top 
4797 Works great 
4798 Package came a little damaged and sealed with tape, but product was in good condition. It works fine. Level indicator is a little weak. 
4799 The logo does not look like what it shows in the picture!!!! Instead of the embroidered letters, it s actually an ugly piece of black rubber attached onto the bag. :( 
4800 AAAA 
4801 Great value. Perfect for teenage grandson. Holding up well. He lives it. 
4802 Great lens very sharp and fast and I love it! Quality feeling and quality look. Worth every penny. Very happy I purchased this lens 
4803 Met my expectations. 
4804 This battery died very quickly on me. 
4805 Needs handle bars. 
4806 Fit and works great! 
4807 This umbrella soft box does not have a white interior as the description claims. That was the only reason I bought this version over the others that are available and it was incorrect. The build quality was fine for the price. 
4808 Great for home 
4809 Works great, But complicated. Have to read directions often. I don t use it a lot so I forget. 
4810 I love the Bella twins poser 
4811 Great device extremely helpful in close-up work 
4812 Met my expectations 
4813 Better than the factory dji box, but you still have to remove the rotors and it bends the RC antennas a little. Also the pockets and zipper storage for the rotors would be too tight and potentially bend them. 
4814 nice cap. cheap replacement. 
4815 Canon continues to stay on the cutting edge of digital photography, with controls that can be changed on-the-fly while in use. 
4816 two details of this tripod that I do not like: the minimum length is too long, the 2 release handles (for the quick release plate) are a little too stiff. 
4817 Fine 
4818 This was a great first lighting kit for me. The quality of the items were great and its a very easy and quick set up and take down with great carrying cases. 
4819 Arrived as expected and was in good condition. 
4820 No problems. Very accurate description 
4821 Great quality. Better than Nikon 
4822 The cameras have only been up a little over a week now and two out of four no longer even work. Is this set of security cameras junk? I paid an additional $100 to have them mounted on the outside. And I am out a lot of money now. 
4823 At full optical zoom the image starts to get blurrier. 
4824 LOVE IT 
4825 i had the instax mini 8 and was fed up with the over or under exposure that happened too much! this one enables much more control on how the photo turns out! love learning all the cool functions and modes! 
4826 while I have only used the camera for a few weeks and still learning I have noticed improved speed and sharp pictures. 
4827 Great charger! 
4828 Wifes rebel t3 fits nicely. 
4829 Only helpfull if you use them. But reading them they are full of good info. 
4830 This bag is beautiful and holds a mirror less camera, four lenses, batteries, filters and memory cards. Truly amazing for its size. 
4831 Would not fit my camera. Should have read reviews before ordering. 
4832 i love this flash! adds such good dynamic lighting 
4833 These work great in the woman s locker room at my health club. 
4834 Awesome bag, the quality is high and the design is awesome. if you love old school stuff :) 
4835 Fast shipping, nice flash, awesome speed light. 
4836 I like the head mount better for what I am using it for (tracking with my dog, and nosework) but it is very adjustable and another tool to use with the GoPro :) 
4837 Love love love the bag! I couldn t be happier with my purchase! The bag has plenty of room for my camera and everything else I usually carry in my purse! 
4838 Nice products! 
4839 Easy to use camera. Quality pictures & simple directions 
4840 It okay the press button does work to good 
4841 The camera is great, all in perfect conditions! 
4842 it doesn t last and it gets hot 
4843 I purchased these to use on a Galaxy S6 and was disappointed, the clip did not fit well and the Macro only seemed to come into focus if the object was about 0.50&#34; so I returned them. 
4844 This is well made and I use it alot, I carry it everwhere with me because I take my camera everywhere with me and it has stood up to my goings. 
4845 The treading is a bit rough but it definitely gets the job done. 
4846 Look very official. Can only be seen on clear windows as they stick on the inside of window. 
4847 Henry i want to say that Mr. Henry was very helpful he installed my cam in it didn t take him a long time i want to say thank you for all your help in doing so 
4848 PRICE WAS FAIR AND QUALITY IS EXCELLENT..NO LEAK S AND SIMPLE TO USE... 
4849 It works great even under water 
4850 Muy buen producto 
4851 Works perfectly! 
4852 Super fun camera! Captures great sunsets and dogs running on the beach with great detail. Looking forward to getting additional lenses! 
4853 None of the pictures came out. They were too dark. 
4854 If you are considering purchasing a digital frame, this is the one to buy! My pictures look fabulous. I will be purchasing additional frames for myself and for gifts. 
4855 Love it! Nice to handle and work photos! 
4856 If you think about getting a tripod for your camera? This is the perfect one! Very light, user friendly, and i just love the design. I didn t have to read the manual, it s that easy to use. 
4857 I have more bags than you can count. Always looking for the best camera bag. It has not be made as yet. However, this is the best bag I found for the micro 4/3 camera and three lens. Love it. My favorite bag. 
4858 I bought the 16 inch one and the 10 inch one. Very protective, but also very thick. I like the fact that I can wrap my lenses up as a burrito or a baby, hahaha. 
4859 Works well when taking group picture! 
4860 Fantastic !! 
4861 I received the item in a well protected box. The battery grip comes with instructions in English. I am very pleased with the grip. Function keys work perfectly for my Rebel XSI. I would recommend this grip. Feels solid on my camera. 
4862 Exactly as expected. Never had a problem switching lenses, comes off and goes on with out a problem. Came quickly, very satisfied with purchase! 
4863 Worked well when i owned Cannon 
4864 Great product at a great price. 
4865 Works great 
4866 I really like how the camera works 
4867 Great kit highly recommend. 
4868 Useful 
4869 Works just like the original.... Kept my GoPro attached to my motorcycle fender from San Frandisco to Portland and Back! 
4870 It s a camera case, and a good one. Fit my waterproof Fuji camera really well and feels as though it provides excellent protection for my camera. What s not to like? 
4871 Tried to revive my flip ultra that won t charge...still won t charge. Not the battery s fault..I guess. Too bad, it took great pictures, but too expensive to replace. Will go back to using my camera phone. 
4872 compact and easy to store, easy to use. 
4873 Great Binoculars for the price. They can be hard to hold steady in your hands. 
4874 Awesome! 
4875 These hold a charge as well as the Fuji X-t1 battery, and maybe a little better. It turns off when fully charged and will hold its charge for many days unused. 
4876 Not impressed, already the large thumbscrew has strip out. The quality is very questionable which is my reason for one star. 
4877 It does the job ... However, build quality is not as good as it should be 
4878 Better stay off it unless u have all day time and a dead specimen to click. 
4879 Not that much good quality video 
4880 really handy charger convent battery holds good charge 
4881 Good product. 
4882 good 
4883 This item fits perfectly. They are a great, affordable alternative. 
4884 Nice strapt but without enough flotation for maintain coolpix AW130 on the water level, you need to add an small flotation block 
4885 Wish the batteries last longer. At 2 and a half months the battery reached the red. Still an awesome device for home security. 
4886 Very clear picture. Works great! Set-up was a breeze. Had tried other cameras before and the set-up was terrible, so bad I never used them! 
4887 I got this thinking it would work to start and stop video, but it works only as a shutter for the still camera. 
4888 This camera case can carry all of my equipment to a crime scene. I also like the fact that it s water proof (more so than my other bag was) and that I have everything in one place. 
4889 Enjoyed using this lens on vacation. Used it for landscape as well as astrophotography. 
4890 Everything has been great.. Pleasure to use! 
4891 As i expected. 
4892 Thank you! 
4893 Using now and they work great and hold as good a charge as my original. 
4894 Battery charger works well. No complaints. 
4895 haven t had a chance to use yet but everything looks fine 
4896 I have used this type device before and paid 3x as much for one that is no better, if not as good. Really makes a difference in the grip and ability to steady the camera. NICE! 
4897 This microphone worked really well for General sound on my short films and videos. 
4898 The selfie stick works awesome. Not quite as long as i expected but has a great battery life. The seller was very easy to work with and 10/10 would buy from them again 
4899 Nice Point and Shoot Digital Camera, but the battery runs out pretty quickly! 
4900 i love using these with my instant camera. especially when i take photos of my 3 year old, she loves seeing the photos come out on the disney film 
4901 This was great! Looks like the real thing. 
4902 I love it! It s exactly what I was looking for! 
4903 Batery life is 45 minutes 
4904 a little expensive but works great 
4905 Horrible quality. Get a better camera. 
4906 I wanted one of the clips shown in original picture but what I saw and what I received were 1 piece different. No other issues! 
4907 I like it and am enjoying it for the purpose I bought this for... I ll be back for more, it works amazingly well! 
4908 good to have it... 
4909 Works as advertised! Not much more to say than that! 
4910 Everything fit my SONY, great price too! Everything is still working after three vacations! 
4911 Works Great !! 
4912 Great Thank you. 
4913 Works great! ! Camera I just bought didn t have one. I like to keep the flash connection clean and damage free. 
4914 Perfect!!! 
4915 Extremely fast service, got it in one piece. ** Only one situation. The ilustration (as shown)and as per description, the &#34;The Tripod adapter&#34; Base is incomplete or missing. 
4916 Thank you 
4917 It s a cool grip but the camera feels a little unbalanced when it s on. 
4918 The batteries worked just fine,in the camera and the charger.Thank you. 
4919 Fantastic. Will be buying many more. Only gripe I have is that the base plate doesn t have the larger thread option. Really wish it was there. 
4920 Just as advertised. 
4921 excellent 
4922 A must for any one camping and good for everyday use. 
4923 Awesome, if u r a little girl 
4924 It works as Intended and right on time 
4925 Bought one along With the camera but the lens cover on the case was cracked and felling apart Just by taking it off the bag, by mistake I bought two cases and the other one was fine but Im second guessing on submerging this case With the camera incide 
4926 not user friendly 
4927 I really liked this camera though it is not advanced as others I have owned in the past, For the price, it gets the job done. 
4928 Product was in great condition(new) and worked out great 
4929 Nice 
4930 Works as advertised charging my Sony Camcorder NP-F330 battery 
4931 Great camera, amazing pictures, easy to use, awesome zoom and incredible quality product 
4932 Not as expected. I thought from picture it would be a dual charger. It isn t. 
4933 very portable! 
4934 Excellent camera, service was great and help me set up in minutes. App makes the camera useful and mobile. 
4935 Delivered as advertised and works great 
4936 Nice product and delivered on time. 
4937 Gave as a gift to my daughter. She is very pleased 
4938 Great Item! Would buy again. Did not disappoint. 
4939 I m very pleased with my tripod came a lot faster than I thought. It s a lil flimsy but you get what you pay for I m satisfied over all 
4940 Perfect fit arrived a day early. Thank u. 
4941 Seems sturdy and easy to use! Take the time to learn the menus for ease of changing settings on the go! 
4942 It is too small for my Nikon D3000 
4943 I ve had nothing but problems with it, from the wheels falling off, to the knobs not holding their position to an unfixable wobble, the problems are endless. Invest in something better than this, you ll be glad you did. 
4944 Absolutely the best! I only put B+W on my lenses. So clear sometimes it appears like there is no glass in the frame. The slim profile is perfect for the Olympus 12mm wide. Plenty of groove up front for a lens cap. 
4945 Too much distortion, even after you set the Lens Conversion setting. This is true for both the wide angle and the telephoto. The telephoto is worse, though. You re better off just spending more money on a better attachment. 
4946 Everything you d want and more! 
4947 My old worn out battery holds better charge that this new one... I don t recommend it. 
4948 Needs to be plugged in to charger to use auto feature. Also very sensitive to the touch, it falls off holder when I go to unplug it. Other than that it does its job! 
4949 Great,thanks 
4950 Takes alright pictures...just takes what feels like &#34;a few seconds&#34; between each shot. So, can t take rapid pictures. 
4951 Great add-on for a product. Excellent shipping, and no issues. 
4952 Affordable and handy. Very sturdy build. Worth the money. 
4953 Just bought this camera a couple of weeks ago for a really good price. I m really Stocked with the camera and everything that came with it. The shipping was great. Thanks a lot! 
4954 Did not come as pictured. Connectors are female to RCA, not female to female 
4955 Don t bother with these. They fall apart and are easily lost. My husband lost 2 in 2 days. Money down the drain. Buy better ones. 
4956 So far, so good! Does exactly what I wanted. 
4957 I had bought this alongside my RF Explorer because I figured it was something special for the unit. It is a fine case for it, but its nothing different than a generic hard drive like case. 
4958 quality is good enough for indoor use. 
4959 Good 
4960 Excellent service from Calvin in helping setup. Camera is great 
4961 I ve owned two of this lens and it is my favorite I have ever had. Everything is perfect. Sharp!!!!! 
4962 Working good so far Don t know in the future 
4963 Great product. 
4964 An amazing camera with an amazing auto focus and built quality. Image quality is what you payed for. No more to say. 
4965 Pleased with product performance, soft yet durable with multiple functionality options at a super great price. Glad I bought it! 
4966 It works alright. Little bulky.. Not as much room as indicated by pictures and other user reviews. Decent for a casual day of shooting, but doesn t hold all I d like it after reading the reviews 
4967 Perfect was what i need 
4968 Great for keeping a your Gopro equipment safe and orderly. Would recommend. 
4969 Everything Works Great 
4970 Screen became washed out after 40 days. 
4971 Works great. 
4972 This lens is well worth the price of admission. It is fast and sharp. It is great for shooting sports. It is very heavy, so expect a workout when you shoot. 
4973 Great video quality, and works really well with my iphone 6. Love the ease of viewing. 
4974 Simple and effective! 
4975 Easy setup, works great. 
4976 It works!! I like it! 
4977 Glad I found this for the price,works great .. 
4978 Battery arrived in time and is working beautifully 
4979 love having an extra battery when traveling 
4980 Product was as advertised. 
4981 True to what it is and how it is advertised. Love having an extra battery; keeps the charge just as long as the battery that came with my nikon dslr. 
4982 Lost my old cord - works great. 
4983 Compact, well made, will be taking them to our Yellowstone park trip next month. 
4984 A little pricey but works geeat 
4985 Gave this as a gift. Friend loved it. Uploading and ease of use is wonderful. Nice large screen. She likes to display four photos on each screen view. Would definitely buy again. 
4986 Lena cap does not fit hood 
4987 Same color as described. Great thick quality as usual 
4988 This was a great tripod for the price range. Just high enough that you can film people with the camera at face level. Very easy to use, no complaints at all! 
4989 Not as cheap as sony but still good 
4990 Camera works as advertised, wish the mounting bracket was better designed so I can attach it to the eve versus having to mount to wall, other then that works very good, great night vision, field of view is better then most others I have tried 
4991 Love the caamera and the picss. 
4992 I like it 
4993 great value, thanks for the deal 
4994 Love the camera but the accessories are junk. 
4995 Great product, I use it on my seadoo spark. 
4996 The product comes in Chinese letters and could not figure out how to put it into english. 
4997 Great lens!!! 
4998 good product 
4999 Just what I expected 
5000 great price fast shipping 
5001 Great bag, too small for 9900. returned bag 
5002 has very short sensing range 
5003 Nice 
5004 Nice color 
5005 Great product! exactly what I needed. 
5006 Just like the original. perfect fit. easy pluck. used it to reconfigure the case for my camera and lenses. 
5007 good designer, good quality, and easy to use 
5008 great 
5009 This lens is very good 
5010 its not a wide angle 
5011 .but works well for phot and video on my DSLR 
5012 Works perfectly for when I need flash harsh light diffused. Great price! 
5013 Great Battery 
5014 very happy with my purchase! 
5015 Product was as advertised. 
5016 Thanks 
5017 for a motorcycle rider it is far superior compared to the competition. The video and audio is clear and after 6 months of use has been flawless in use after hundreds of hours of recording on a daily use. 
5018 I like this camera and have gotten several compliments on it, some due to the red color which makes it unique. My only problem is that you have to turn the camera off , and then on again if you turn it on before removing the lens cap. 
5019 Low Quality Gives cameras a rainbow on the screen 
5020 Works fine. Not enlarge enough and not bright enough. 
5021 Fine product. 
5022 Good price/delivered right on time!! Work s well!! 
5023 Good purchase and overall quality.... I would prefer if the joints remained stiff over the life of the tripod... but it s not bad! 
5024 The camera is good but the rest of the assessories are garbage. The batteries on the battery charger wont charge. The cleaning solution was open and everything on the inside of the bag was wrecked so I had to be thrown away. 
5025 Great walk around lens. Takes decent portraits. One of my favorite lenses. Does a good job with indoor photos. Excells outdoors! Great price for an L glass! A must have for any collection. 
5026 Very good! Works great! 
5027 Returned 
5028 Great product and will purchase again. 
5029 Didn t meet my expectations, couldn t charge battery 100%,mostly 85% to 90% only. 
5030 lens cap is great so far. I tried an attachment ring for the first time. It moved and caused my camera lanes to jam causing an error code, and then it fell apart. But I bought it for the lens cap, not the attachment. I could do without those. 
5031 Hard to install on a verizon system. The night vision requires a bright light. The picture however is excellent. 
5032 Excellent! 
5033 This case provides great storage and travels great for my Sony Digital SLR. Lots of pockets and is made of good quality. 
5034 Works fine I like it 
5035 Love it! Wish I had bought it sooner. 
5036 Worked perfectly. Looks identical to the Sony original at a fraction of the price 
5037 Ok 
5038 My daughter loved it!! So happy with it 
5039 Easy to use, perfect for our needs 
5040 I am enjoying to see my cats in my house while I am working at my office. 
5041 Fine for the price but does not have a tripod mount as the description implies. 
5042 To hard to get loaded on pc , light weight and moves around to much on your face and you can t tell if you are recording or not 
5043 Great product. Fast shipping. Secure packing. Exactly as described. Thank you! 
5044 a little short, shorther then the factory one, it it was 10 inches longer this would be a hit. 
5045 First one fell apart So far the replacement is fine Easy return process, with no problems 
5046 This product is a piece of crap I tried to get my money back but they never responed 
5047 Very helpful item,thank you very much 
5048 the backpack does look like the one is the picture doesn t say DJI on it disappointed 
5049 after reading all the reviews, I elected to buy this lcd cover (I m too clumsy not to scratch things). Easiest application ever, perfect fit - looks like part of the camera. Doesn t obscure screen at all. Very happy with purchase! 
5050 For the price, it exceeded my expectations. 
5051 Just as described. 
5052 Super high-quality polarizer filter. I like the great thin construction of the filter, the color cast isn t too blue either. Breakthrough also stands by their products. If you want to step in from Tiffen and Hoya, try out Breakthrough filters. 
5053 Super convenient and as such you ll likely have it when you desperately need it (as I ve found) 
5054 excelente 
5055 We bought this to fit our Nikon COOLPIX P600 16.1 MP Wi-Fi CMOS Digital Camera with 60x Zoom NIKKOR Lens and Full HD 1080p Video 
5056 Works great, no complaints. 
5057 Quick turn around. Great product, fantastic price. 
5058 I love it. 
5059 This is a great bag. Seems well built. And for a camera bag it s probably just right. I m using it as a messenger bag for work. As such, having some more organization would be helpful (pen slots, interior pockets, etc) but ice made sure by accessorizing. 
5060 Easy to use, not too heavy, and I like the document flap in the front inside cover. 
5061 Junk. Brand new and don t hold a charge. 
5062 Compact, but amazing little camera. Great zoom capabilities. Love it! 
5063 It s okay, but nothing to write home about. 
5064 Works as expected and no complaints from me. I will update my review should that change. 
5065 Great service, delivered precisely as stated. Thanks. 
5066 Works as described but the remote control switch felt cheap and felt like it would not hold up over time. 
5067 works as described. 
5068 Works really well, batteries seem to last just as long as the original gopro battery. Charger works great as well even with all three batteries charging simultaneously. 
5069 For the price you cant beat it not to mention the looks, its preety good 
5070 Looks and works great 
5071 awesome bag 
5072 My friend told me I do not need to worry about the battery cause it does last long. But it s OK. 
5073 Perfect!!! 
5074 Great camera. I use it outside of my home and it s got the clearest image of any camera I ve used. I have is recording constantly to a nas and it has worked flawlessly. I highly recommend it. 
5075 Excellent strap. I really like the fact that the strap is detachable via a click button and swappable with a normal non floating cord for everyday use. The regular strap came with the two pack. Strap is very buoyant in the water. 
5076 good cap cheap replacement. 
5077 Just as expected and fast delivery 
5078 Very versatile and did what was expected. I am really amazed at the quality you get for the price. Great value! 
5079 This works perfectly for in-studio shoots. A heavier version is better for outdoor shoots or if using heavy backdrops. 
5080 More then enough light at an exceptional price! 
5081 My Canon Powershot SX710 fits perfectly in this - with room for extra batteries. It is small enough that I can put it in my purse so my camera is with me all the time. It is a quality product. 
5082 Awesome 
5083 Very good results. Totally satisfied... 
5084 Excellent buy. 
5085 They are what they seem to be. Very large, easy to store and they get the job done... oh yeah and they are priced right. 
5086 great product 
5087 The best value with the lowest cost per photo - I ll never run out or miss the perfect shot! 
5088 I m not a camera person...not what I expected... 
5089 Pretty nice camera for what I paid 
5090 Only worked for 7 months. 
5091 I was surprised how well constructed this was. I mean good zippers and all. I feel you really get your moneys worth. 
5092 Got this as a present for my parents and they LOVE it!! 
5093 great product 
5094 It s a very nice Len very solid but it doesn t work that great with the A7ii. 
5095 Great product. 
5096 Camera works great and Henry at Foscam did the install. Henry was tremendous -- patient, professional and helpful. Kudos to all! 
5097 This is a great product!!! 
5098 absolute trash 
5099 Great buy, great item, works 100% every time in all modes... 
5100 Great little camera! 
5101 I received this and wanted to charge the battery for my son. It didn t charge, I don t know whether the battery is bad or the actual charger. :( 
5102 Perfect! 
5103 Excelente product. Amaing zoom. 
5104 LEAVE ME ALONE! 
5105 my daughter loves this- was her Bithday gift. my only concern is it will be outdated in no time .too expensive for what is about to come to market 
5106 came in black, but i like that better than the grey. no sealed pockets for memory cards and spare batteries though. 
5107 So far its being great 
5108 Arrived promptly and as described. 
5109 Not bad. 
5110 Not good for all cameras listed. The case included is tiny. 
5111 Henry Thanks again for helping me set up my 2 cameras again. These are great cameras and the only drawback is I need to buy more. I highly recommend these cameras as well as the tech support provided by Henry and the Foscam team.. 
5112 Received my product very quickly from the seller. Thanks!! The film was perfect and the price was PERFECT!! 
5113 Love it it is great! I m using it with Canon Pima IP110 and while slightly large, it works well!!! 
5114 Everything worked perfectly. Very satisfied. e 
5115 Exelente 
5116 Good quality mount for smaller diameter bars. 
5117 Returned for refund as they were not genuine GoPro items, as advertised. All of the other items I purchased WERE genuine. 
5118 All is perfect 
5119 trash!!!!!! original battery with 1030mAh working in two times longer than this batteries with 2300 mAh 
5120 Works good. Delivered in time. 
5121 Great 
5122 The glass was very nice. I just used them a couple of times but looking forward to playing! 
5123 all good; great value and great product. 
5124 The battery is listed as DMW-BCF10PP but i received BCF-10E which is a different voltage and mAH rating so i had to return it. 
5125 Works well. I have been a max of 10 feet away so far, and I have yet to have trouble. This is DEFINITELY worth the buy. 
5126 very clear, you need a tripod for steady viewing 
5127 charge up fast, work great, don t heat up while it is being charged up, holds charge really good 
5128 Excellent item 
5129 Love it! Arrived fast ! 
5130 very good！ 
5131 Perfect way to hold my camera! love it way more than a neck strap, and it looks cool and kind vintage! 
5132 Looks good. Wife really loved it! 
5133 gets the job done. 
5134 My daughter enjoys taking pictures. 
5135 Works great 
5136 don t buy it !!!!!! went up smoke !!!!!!!!!! 
5137 I m not pleased with the color of the pictures it takes. 
5138 Really love this camera! It has been a great upgrade for me. I use it for interior real estate photography as well nature and family photography. 
5139 Got it the next day COOL a swivel to point the camera forward be handy 
5140 Love the Glass. Extremely sharp when stopped down to 8.0. It is solid and goes great with a full frame body. 
5141 Works! 
5142 Great product! Was as described and received item in a very timely manner. 
5143 The LEDs are grossly underpowered. It wont even light up an area 10 feet away. I m sorry I bought it. Used to sell for over a hundred dollars? Baloney! 
5144 works, gets the job done 
5145 High quality, best cleaning pad I ever had 
5146 compared to what plastic components for the GoPro are going for, the price on this item seemed steep. my suggestion is that if you have this component, don t lose it. otherwise, it does what it s supposed to do. 
5147 Awesome product, easy to assemble and use. 
5148 Did some shots of the Milky Way here in New Mexico and they came out better than I expected. So far I m really impressed with this lens. 
5149 Good package deal, easy to fly, lots of fun 
5150 It s nice enough but it keeps corrupting the USB stick that stores the photos. I ve had to reload the USB several times now. 
5151 One of the last viewfinder cameras. Takes great pictures when you allow sufficient time for it to focus. 
5152 Love my Foldio! I use it to take pictures for my esty shop. They turn out well lit and with a nice uniform background. It is also very convent since its not that big and can be folded up to taken on the go. 
5153 I like this camera, nice size to fit into your pocket. Got some amazing photos at a concert. The zoom made it seem like we were right up front. 
5154 I love the device. Only wish is that it sat high enough when facing myself from a low angle that the hardware was not visible in shot. 
5155 Very good I would recommend the sky master. 
5156 Great price! heavy though. 
5157 Only complaint, battery life should be better, drains to quickly when recording video. Good for simplicity, but battery, MEH! Wifi turned on and battery really tanks pretty quick. picture quality is good for the price, audio not it s finest feature. iPhone app, kind of sucks and crashes a lot. 
5158 Fake toy, None of the sensors were accurate, not even close. 
5159 exelent! 
5160 Works great 
5161 We have loved this easy to use camera. 
5162 good price and product. 
5163 Works great and Good price 
5164 I was skeptical at first when I ordered this, but was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this item. Very satisfied so far. 
5165 While these batteries are not the best build quality as the original GoPro batteries, they last quite as long as the Original batteries. And for throw away prices, you wouldnt regret a bit. Go for it! 
5166 Cheap but works. 
5167 Returned, it did not fit. Seemed to be made as well as any others I have seen. 
5168 works perfectly with my a6000 
5169 This hood is perfect, fit and finish very good, always satisfied buying from this seller 
5170 great item, will buy again for my 2nd a6000 
5171 Works as advertised for Canon 7d Mark 2 
5172 this is my 3rd time buying for my friends same product. 
5173 LOVE THIS MOUNT SO MUCH!!!!! customer service is incredible. no problems with shipping. cant wait to try it out 
5174 nice case 
5175 Worked as advertised. 
5176 Works! 
5177 A little bulky for what it does (remote camera shutter, flash) but works as stated from any position. 
5178 I couldn t find all his potential use yet. I m trying to find special situations to use it. 
5179 Memory Card not included in the box. You need to buy one separately or the camera will not work. Also, the &#34;Must Have&#34; accessory kit is not needed. Other than the camera case, all other items come with camera or are superfluous. 
5180 It s all good. 
5181 A 
5182 It does the job. I love the lcd screen. Why pay over 400 when u can get this camera 
5183 Ghhg 
5184 great product......super fast delivery 
5185 works ok 
5186 Works great. I love that I can use this with the wrist guard or without. I like having to be able to take a picture one handed and still have my camera secure. Great purchase! 
5187 Its so great that its good in capturing those moments other consider as hard to capture 
5188 Great birthday as birthday gift or special occasion. The girlfriend loves it, and is super satisfied with the picture quality. 
5189 Excellent- I put it on my Sony night shot and can see and record 30-40 ft farther than without ity. 
5190 Very good quality, perfect fit, and superb aesthetic. Well worth the price. The supplier also sent me a complementary wrist strap of equally good quality. 
5191 The ones shipped with camera go out around 1.5 years. I have 6 cameras and have had to replace 3. Hope this lasts a little longer.... 
5192 It fits as advertised, seems to be of high quality and is made in OH. What more can I say! However, I have not crashed my Phantom 3 since I installed it, which is also a good thing. 
5193 Bought this for my daughter for a birthday present and she loves it! 
5194 I bought this for nikkon p900.. But it too small to store it.. 
5195 I could not find the cable that came with OLY OMD M1 camera and I did not want to pay OLY s price and this one seems to work perfectly. 
5196 The box was opened and the backdrop was wet and mildewed. I had to wash it when I got it. I should have returned it but I took to long. 
5197 The control board works great. Didn t need the new housing. 
5198 Could be more helpful for setting them up. No help at all from anyone.. 
5199 Works with t1i. 
5200 Nice. Keep an eye on the knob attached to the camera, it does work itself loose. 
5201 Love how you can use it with one hand. 
5202 Nice product. Good value. 
5203 Great product 
5204 Good product ! 
5205 It didn t work w any of my lighting 
5206 Great for wedding pictures. Holds lots of 4x6 pictures. 
5207 The cables were not long enough and my mouse was cracked once received, which made me have to purchase a new mouse and longer cables. Also the instructions were not very detailed and very limited. Picture quality is good. 
5208 Excellent 
5209 fits & works... what more? 
5210 Perfect replacement for a lost charger 
5211 Exceptional. Very comfortable. As described. Hand slides in, able operate camera and easy out. Secure. 
5212 Love it! It worked perfectly. One thing to be aware of, it completely overrides your camera s controls when plugged in to a remote trigger (i.e. pocket wizard), so you must unplug it to adjust exposure, focus, etc., then plug it back in. 
5213 Excellent! 
5214 Very nice point and shoot camera! Love how small it is so it can fit in my clutch! 
5215 Came in very quick. I love how everything was in it s individual packages. I have two lens, on 18-55mm and on 75-250mm, and this actually works for both! 
5216 As described. Wery good 
5217 fits perfect on my girlfriends Fuji xe2 kit lens. 
5218 Love these and easy to use. 
5219 Very nice outfit. Easy way to just jump right in and have everything you need to get your feet wet. 
5220 product was not one continuous printed sheet which would have been fine, except there is a very noticeable seam that wasn t properly aligned. Print quality is great, and the material is of good quality, but would have been a much higher rating if the workmanship was better 
5221 My daughter loves this camera. Had to replace the SD Card almost immediately, but since then it has worked for her. 
5222 I would recommend this slider. 
5223 It said right on the box it would not work on the Olympus OMD EM5 which I had purchased it for. 
5224 Does not turn on, stuck on intro screen 
5225 it s ok 
5226 The lens does a great job for us. 
5227 Never got to use them, as the Ram Twis-lock suction cup mount that we purchased to mount our GoPro camera with fell off of our Harley, on our way to Sturgis SD, over 4000 miles round trip. 
5228 I just wanted something simple but good quality - this one is perfect for me. Easy to use and great quality! 
5229 WORKS GREAT 
5230 Defective! When plugged it did not even turn on... I m returning this item. 
5231 Does what it says - great product, easy to set up. 
5232 Thx 
5233 Great camera, good deal. Very happy. 
5234 The cable didn t fit on my Olympus 1030. 
5235 arrived quickly, mounted easily, seems much better than the spotter scope which came with the telescope 
5236 Nice, works well with my camers 
5237 Worked Perfectly in my old SONY MVC-FD200. Charger even recharged the old (10 yr) Li-on battery that came with the camera. Highly Recommend. 
5238 Works perfectly. 
5239 Love it! 
5240 Great condition, works perfectly! My pictures have all come out fantastically. No complaints. 
5241 nice construction and quality better than expected for the price 
5242 Great lens!!! 
5243 Good value! 
5244 Very cool little add on, they work great, they re light durable and easy to pack around! I d say the perfect solution if don t want to get a real flash extension! 
5245 Amazing light for the money, the battery pack is pretty reliable and last as described. 
5246 Great product! 
5247 Light weight easy to use, this is my 3rd GoPro 
5248 Love it! 
5249 Love it! 
5250 Even better quality then the image depicted. Good tripod for the money. 
5251 I love it 
5252 I am very happy to get the disposable camera, because I can t find them in a store anymore...Irene 
5253 I just love it. Perfect size for my camera and great quality 
5254 these do the trick very well, they went on without any trouble J R 
5255 This camera met all of my expectations. I used the bicycle mount and recorded my bike ride. I also went swimming with it and got great footage. 
5256 My camera did not get scratched at all when I journeyed with it over seas. 
5257 It was great and better then I expected! Highly recommend it. 
5258 I received the Canon EOS Rebel T6s as promised. The Imaging World shipped it faster than I expected and it was exactly as advertised. 
5259 For the size, I really don t think that this stand can be beat. 
5260 Everything arrived on time and in clean working order. I had no issues with my photo shoot so I am very happy with my order! Thank you! 
5261 Great price, works perfect. 
5262 Couldn t have found a better deal. However, will have to return it for a Tab 4. 
5263 Very nice Camera and the technical support was outstanding by Richard with Foscam. Had some trouble adding to different devices and they completely walked me through all that was needed to get connected on 3 devices. Very fast answer rate as well. 
5264 One of the very coolest electronic items i ve worked with in ages. Priced right to be easily incorporated in any project. 
5265 not as good 
5266 Excellent batteries. 
5267 Good lens I like it fits perfectly on my 60mm fotasy lens adapter on my canon sx50 camera takes get pictures at the beach 
5268 The camera works well when the ethernet cable is plugged in but the wireless function is very hard to set up and goes offline several times a day. I don t recommend this unit so keep looking. 
5269 Love them! I have better security cameras then stores do. I can see clear and love that I can zoom in on specific areas. Feel much safer! 
5270 Not the quality I expected from Sony. Doesn t grip very firmly for an *action* camera. For my use (hiking) I much prefer the no-name camera mounts with spring clips that are much more secure. 
5271 The magnet keeps falling off :/ 
5272 Thank you :)) 
5273 Great product. I m not an over the top go pro accessory kind of person so this is great for me. It would be good for day trips so that you can leave your main go pro box at home 
5274 the lighting kit is a wonderful start would buy again would recommend to others 
5275 Nice cover piece !! 
5276 Nice fitting lens cap 
5277 Absolutely exceeded my expectations with syncing to my phone and emailing pictures directly from camera and the front LCD for easy selfies, no selfie stick needed! 
5278 Everything arrived on time, great experience. 
5279 The x100t button is quite small so this soft release really helps to make it easier to press and reduce camera shake very slightly. I love the look of it too! 
5280 This is one easy camera to use. It takes the nicest photos. It is a great camera. The shipping was spot on as well. It is very thin and fits into most pockets with ease. The only thing I would suggest is to add a screen shade on the back. 
5281 Love it! & so do all my clients! ☺️ 
5282 Great all around camera that takes nice pictures. I use it more than my Canon T3i because of its size and features. 
5283 Excellent lens.. 
5284 Good product. A+ 
5285 Received earlier than expected and works great! 
5286 Filter works as advertised. 
5287 Miniature camera holder Brooke almost immediately and battery does not charge 
5288 Exactly as advertised. I really like this product it seems durable and reliable. I definitely recommend it. 
5289 An amazing camera ! I connect it on my iphone 5 and my wife rus it on her Iphone 6! Both work really great as the description ! Easily achieving remote control and video call functions. Super image quality and clear audio. Happy purchased order 
5290 The Vixen representative gave me incorrect information about its compatibility for use on my Pentax spotting scope. It cost me shipping and insurance to obtain a full refund. 
5291 Really great value at the price! Takes E Mount lenses which I already had so it was an easy decision. I bought it as a backup camera but finding myself using it often. 
5292 Does what it says, solid connection to any Cannon D-series camera, works well with my Ralei strobonar with sync cable. 
5293 great bag for a great price. 
5294 took it out of box and tried to update firmware,now its in repair shop for 8 weeks 
5295 Color temp of the lamps are a bit low for what I had hoped for, but switching them for higher K. (more daylight spectrum) and this works well for taking stock photos for our website. 
5296 I am used to Axis cameras that cost $700 and up so I was very pleased with the quality of this unit. The night vision is way better than any of the other low end cameras I have tried 
5297 Perfect for the little camera we bought. Fits it nice. 
5298 Came in earlier than expected. My son loves it. Just wish the battery last longer. And the SD card won t go back in the camera 
5299 Does what is says. Good machining. 
5300 The product is very compact and seems to work very well. 
5301 Exactly what I was hoping for and it arrived quickly. 
5302 Takes great pictures easy to understand once you realize that the advance mode takes digital zoom and is mode for choosing reds and rest of picture black and white the advanced mode is awesome 
5303 Fantastic product! Best cleaner kit on the market. 
5304 Worked perfectly on all my batteries including the ones I thought were faulty, but the charging port on the camera was the root cause. 
5305 Fit perfectly! 
5306 Seems to be everything it says it is. Still learning, but early trials are very positive. 
5307 i love it...as expected 
5308 Perfect size! 
5309 Works great 
5310 I love tgis light. I ve had for at least two years and it still works great! Not a lot of misfires and the output is good if you are working in a small space. 
5311 Great value. 
5312 Exactly what I was looking for. I have an older Samsung l100 camera without the charger (lost or misplaced it).. This works great! Now my 6yo daughter thinks she s a photographer and loves it! 
5313 The price was perfect for what this is. 
5314 Nice camera and extras. 
5315 Great product, perfect fit for my lens, fast shipment, arriving on time. 
5316 Great! 
5317 Very week broken with the small bump first one 2 minutes 
5318 Great camera for traveling. Great picture quality and easy to use, just need to get used to it. 
5319 Awesome lights. Cheap, affordable, and quality. Excellent quality and really gives that daylight white light instead of yellow room light. FREAKING GET IT!!! NOW!! Or later, I mean it s your choice. 
5320 Guess it is fine, I just do not know how to see with it. 
5321 Good for the price this is all I need for the photos I take. Not professional. 
5322 Lemme was confusing at first had to push button on side to open lens to take pictures works great though 
5323 excellent! 
5324 sorry not much to say it only worked for a couple days,not very well built,the company was very promt. 
5325 Time clock didn t work 
5326 Works great and would buy it again 
5327 The thing works great! I wore it snowboarding and when ur head hits the ground it doesn t break of get damaged! Would recommend it for people that want to wear it during sports!! 
5328 One of the bugs had a broken leg piece (it was separated in the acrylic resin) but other than that, LOVED it and so did my little one. 
5329 Love this! I wish I d had it sooner! what a peace of mind to keep an eye on my dementia mom! 
5330 Fits perfectly. Original Nikon product. 
5331 Just what i needed, awesome camera. 
5332 It worked grate for my Kodak Z730 Camera. 
5333 These are NO good. The thread on the first set I got did not fit any of my Canon DSLRs. I was sent a replacement pair and they too did not screw into my camera. I am return them all. 
5334 It was gift 
5335 terrible 
5336 Got exactly what I ordered quickly and everything is just as I expected it. Couldn t ask for more. 
5337 Camera won t connect to phone. App won t let me sign in on tablet. They shipped a color they didn t even have as an option. Instructions had details wrong. No troubleshooting in instructions. Did I forget anything? Now I have to get my money back. 
5338 Purchased these as a gift for my dad. He says that they re nice and lightweight, with a bit more strength than his previous binoculars. 
5339 Good price and fast shipping 
5340 Got away from kit lenses and glad I did, I have alot more keepers now 
5341 Lights the model very well. The honeycomb grid directs the light very evenly. 
5342 Looked great for my Holiday photos! Good quality too. Wish it was larger size. 
5343 Protects the lensce and gives it a cool look👌 
5344 For the Price there is nothing better 
5345 Impossible to set up. Our son could not figure it out and he is a network engineer! 
5346 Did not fit phone correct as advertised. 
5347 Works as expected. I have no trouble with the fit of the plug/socket on the D610 that some report. A must have for long exposure shots. Landscape type shots with these high res cameras also benefit using a cable/remote shutter release 
5348 Doesn t work 
5349 Affordable lens for great bokeh! 
5350 It is exactly as described. I would deal with this supplier again 
5351 i love it 
5352 Was nicer than I expected. Also the bag itself is relatively easy to carry. 
5353 Good quality OEM product! 
5354 Awesome 
5355 decent system for a decent price. 
5356 Awsome and it was quick shipment 
5357 Was everything I expected. 
5358 It is good shape and works fine. 
5359 Simple to use, and made me feel much better about protecting the LCD on my camera. 
5360 Everything was just as expected. Thanks. 
5361 great product. 
5362 Great item. Delivered promptly and product was perfect. 
5363 Fits perfectly and inexpensive 
5364 Charger works well. Batteries have a very short life (50%) compared to original. 
5365 The price is right. Doesn t work with my Odin TTL flash trigger, but it works as advertised when it is on camera. That s what happens when you try to save money. 
5366 I bought a digital camera at the pawn shop for ten bucks not knowing if it was even going to work and as soon as the battery came I popped it in and it worked! 
5367 i think it has longer battery life than the original. 
5368 The package that i got didnt work 
5369 Love it! 
5370 As described and arrived on time. 
5371 just right 
5372 They work just as well as the OEM batteries for half the price. 
5373 Great for backup. 
5374 Love it 
5375 Did what it was supposed to. Battery charged, no issues. 
5376 wonderful and strong and reliable 
5377 Very nice kit, great price!! 
5378 fit well and stays on 
5379 Item works as expected, arrived ahead of time. I bit small for what i had in mind but it woks. 
5380 excelent product 
5381 Great little camera. Nice pics. Videos take a while to download via WiFi. Going to get a second one for my quad. 
5382 Clamp may work well enough. But I didn t get that far. The arms inside the Gopro mount adapter are too thick. When I mount the camera, the screw does not reach the nut on the opposite side. Useless to mount a Gopro. Back it goes. 
5383 This camera, thus far is superior to the DLink product which costs more. They could use a bit of work on the directions but once I got what they were asking it was a snap. 
5384 What do you expect for 25.00 dollars. 
5385 I m indifferent about this. I thought it would have a little more blowing force but it does its job. 
5386 I love the flexibility of options this shutter gives. Would highly recommend. Only complaint is, like almost everybody else has mentioned, is that is has no on/off switch and will activate easily in a bag if the batteries are left in it. 
5387 simple, easy, fun, and great for scrapbooking, or as party favors! 
5388 having the extra power on hand is crucial when you re out and about. Threw these into my backpack and went all over Mexico with plenty of space on my memory card and plenty of juice in the form of batteries. 
5389 quality...You must be kidding 
5390 I use this as my carry on for business travel. This thing is a TANK. 
5391 works great everything i expected 
5392 Impressive 
5393 Leaps and bounds better than my 50 D. I still use both cameras but the 70 D is my first choice. Light years better than my old 30D. mike 
5394 Excellent product. We use it at the range. 
5395 This item looks great and seems to be made very well. Works perfect and very easy to use. Everything was as described and works great. It fits very well to my GoPro camera. Great value for the money. I highly recommend this to everyone. 
5396 Need to return this. It never worked. Worst product I ve ever ordered off of Amazon. It turned on but would not record anything. Then was unable to turn it off. Seriously do not buy this. 
5397 Pelican is just the best...I have bought other cases, but these are the best available and worth the often small premium. I use mine for go pro and SLR gear and have no fear of water, dropping, or other calamities. 
5398 It works as I expected, sometimes the camera don t record when someone pass in front of the door. 
5399 Love how spacious is! Everything is well cushioned, which protects the equipment. 
5400 Works fine ! 
5401 I thought it would be perfect and ordered one. The product did not work and even when changing the batteries, it still did not work. I ll try another product and see if I have better luck. 
5402 Definitely not as expected, much smaller than I anticipated. I will re-order a larger one & send this back. 
5403 Nice value for money. More than enough light for all my use cases. 
5404 Started with the Foscam... Returned that for this vastly superior product. 
5405 I got exactly what I expected. Case Logic always makes good camera bags. 
5406 WOW! I love this I have made use of it for picture taking it is durable but lightweight it is very comfortable and stays in place when walking the price is great didn t know what to expect because of the price but I am very happy. 
5407 Exactly what I needed. And got it quick 
5408 Didn t give me the results I was looking for. However, that may be my lack of understanding of infrared filters. 
5409 Amazing 
5410 This is so adorable! I bought this to go with the Fugufilm Instax Mini 8 Instant Camera. I think this is a must have to go with the camera! Love everything in the box! 
5411 Took it to 10m under water and works fine. Although the battery seems having a shorter life under water, but generally fine. The image quality is just so so with the original lens. No experince on other lens. 
5412 Fits perfectly, works, one third the price of the way-overpriced Canon version. What more is there to say? Those who say it doesn t fit must be putting it on the wrong lens, this is for the 18-55 STM version. 
5413 I ordered 2 and got 1 not pleased 
5414 worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks. 
5415 The cd would not load and the instructions were not in English. I figured out mostly how to use the camera but I have not tried to print out any pictures yet. 
5416 The video quality is great and it switches to night vision gracefully. Sound quality is not so great. Even with speakers hooked up to either laptop/computer, its very hard to hear noise. The reason this is so important to me is because I use it as a baby monitor. 
5417 Perfect 
5418 This is perfect for my Lumix GX7 camera and it fits it perfectly. 
5419 Get s the job done 
5420 Fantastic lens! Clarity and quality of shots is amazing 
5421 It s so useful for product photography and portrait also macro photography , so I order it from you , thank you for arriving it so quickly 
5422 Great camera 
5423 Works great for my needs 
5424 Works automatically with my cycling computer. Just wet the sensors and strap it on. Strap is comfortable. Nothing much more to it! 
5425 I would buy this again, as well as recomend it to friends.good price 
5426 great bag 
5427 Works as well as any other filter set and price is reasonable. 
5428 did not fit my lens 
5429 Item broke within a week. Money wasted on something that didn t work. 
5430 Good camera 
5431 Everything was good except for one of the light blubs not working. Overall the home studio is coming along quite well with the addition these units. 
5432 Perfect for me photo needs 
5433 This slider is the perfect length! Not so long for transporting. Not that heavy either but the build quality is great! Very smooth operation. Bought the Manfrotto MVH500h Fluid head with it, works great! 
5434 It s definitely not super great in quality, but does the job in terms of capturing a wider angle as a macro lens. Definitely had fun using it, but would not use for professional grade photos! 
5435 Excellent product 
5436 Email motion alerts are crapped ! 
5437 Best mount for the Mobius action cam. 
5438 This is a cheap version of a tulip lens hood, but it did the trick as well as the overpriced ones. I d purchase it again in a heartbeat. 
5439 Would have liked the cases to be a bit more sturdy but worked as expected. 
5440 Good price, quick shipping 
5441 Great, as expected 
5442 Used this with a gopro on a recent dive trip. Six dives in total and it worked well every time. It made for some great underwater shots and selfies with the rest of the dive crew. Solid construction, lightweight and easy to adjust. 
5443 Practical bag for my Sony NX-5N and lenses 
5444 excellent graduated ND filter 
5445 Great value 
5446 its works pretty well 
5447 must have great backdrop indeed 
5448 Really enjoying the mount thus far. Very sturdy and secure. 
5449 Yeah these are awesome. There is a trick to fold them, but there are good videos online. Seller could include a link to a good video though! 
5450 Worst product I ve ever received on amazon. It doesn t work, it doesn t have any of the features that it states. Can t believe they can even sell crap like that! What a joke is right!! 
5451 Disconnects during transfers to my smart phone, got no response from Nikon as to the software they provide. Cannot maintain a connection to my Nikon D3200. Waste of money... 
5452 Great camera. Super happy with it. 
5453 Love this camera. The instant gratification of your pictures being printed instantly is fantastic 
5454 Fits my new Lumix perfectly. 
5455 I think that s what the Doctor order. 
5456 ok 
5457 Nice. 
5458 A must have for photographers. You can fix horizon lines in photoshop, but why have to with this. 
5459 The telephoto extender did not fit any of my EF Canon lenses. 
5460 William Tom was wonderful helping me in getting the camera up and running. Got on my computer and in 2 minutes I was up and running, great tech support! This Camera is fantastic so far.. 
5461 Decent filter, only thing they only have the 52mm size but no markings to identify the manometers. Would not have been that much more effort to add 690nm, 1000nm, ect... on filter. My other filter was also like that so 4 stars. 
5462 Awesome device! 
5463 As advertised. 
5464 Item works well 
5465 The camera works just fine. Gives acceptable video. 
5466 It even fools me. I catch myself going into the room to turn off the TV before I leave, only to realize it s just the fake TV doing it s thing. 
5467 No Complains on the Hood, but unfortunately, I have vignetting issues on my 10-18mm lens so if you are looking for wide angle not recommended, else its good. 
5468 A great camera kit for an even better price! Easy to use a pretty straight forward DSLR 
5469 Excellent product at a great price. 
5470 Takes great photos. However, the camera is either too small for my hands and fingers or my hands and fingers are too big for this camera. Since Amazon won t give me a bigger camera I asked God to give me smaller hands and fingers. 
5471 Very nice item!!!!!! I got it earlier than I expected, great shipping !!!!!!! 
5472 Excellent product! 
5473 love the new camera strap! I get lots of complements on the new look! Love the colors and the sizing. 
5474 After trying 4 other cameras. This one is great. Opened the package and 5 minutes later we were viewing picture on APP. 
5475 Work great, nice packing. 
5476 Very nice 
5477 It s a good bag other that it really needs a little more support in the back to keep your items from beating you up when you have it on. 
5478 For the price, the build quality could be much better. Specially the pol filter is tricky to screw on and easily can fall off. Was expecting much better quality for such a price tag. 
5479 Love it! 
5480 Great protective case while still allowing you to touch the screen through the case. It s a must have for the GoPro! 
5481 works great. arrived as promised. very good value. 
5482 works fine 
5483 I think this one is the best you can get for the money 
5484 The green part is dark. Not a true choroma green color.. Requires more light to render green screen properly... I regret buying it. 
5485 Real nice 
5486 Easy to use. Once you find out the best area you need to place the monitor its very easy and I have had no problems with using this device. I would purchase this product again. 
5487 I used this lense to rake time lapse of a sunset. The pictures are so clear abe crisp. 
5488 Excellent product at low Price and excellent comunication with the seller, the i­tem arrived before the date estimated, thanks a lot!!! full recommended. 
5489 Excellent déclencheur mutifonction je le recommande 
5490 Awesome product. I like it much better than the screw on and safety clip version. 
5491 I m not a professional photographer so I don t see the stuff they see in photos. All I know is this filter works for me & my nx2000 with no &#34;X&#34; in the picture like people claim to have. 
5492 Incredibly well made, fits perfect. Firmly holds both the camera and lens. 
5493 nice 
5494 Helps my device stay a float in water. Color is visible from far away. 
5495 Love it 
5496 it does what it says it was going to do 
5497 Works great!!! 
5498 Great deal and an excellent product 
5499 Worked great on my recent vacation. It is a bit heavy to carry on the camera around my neck but I just supported it in one hand while walking and it was fine. Wish I would have bought this one years ago! 
5500 very good quality 
5501 Worked great! I used it with my iPhone and Camera, pictures came out great! Bluetooth worked great on this as well. 
5502 Good. 
5503 The more I use it the more I like it. For the price it s great, but the software could use some refining. 
5504 very sweet grip 
5505 very good 
5506 Bought as a replacement for an older set wanted better glass than I had. These are very clear and lightweight. I will be taking them on my next hunting trip. 
5507 Works great 
5508 This case for moving your Slik tripod around is very well engineered and made. I am glad I purchased it with the tripod. 
5509 Terrific camera. Very compact very easy to carry 
5510 Fast and perfect fit! Highly recommend this company. I was worried about a lens cap which wasn t Canon made but Canon s were so expensive...these fit well and have attaching chords....Delivery time was before I could lose my last lens cap! Thanks! 
5511 These work perfectly, small and cheap enough for one in every camera bag. Batteries are easy yo find and last a very long time. 
5512 defective would not work at all 
5513 European 
5514 Love this little thing, but make sure the gopro is showing or else it might look like somthing a bit weird. Works Perfectly and is fun to use! 
5515 I ve used this product over the last year while skiing in Colorado, underwater in Mexico and everywhere in between. Works like a charm, never had a problem with use or durability. 
5516 Great strap!! Got this for my dad as a gift and it works amazingly! 
5517 Quick delivery, item just as described. 
5518 Not sure of the battery s charge life yet, but so far the battery works great in my camera. 
5519 Too heavy for a phone, and the quality of the picture comes out too distorted on the edges. The quality of the alleged &#34;Professional HD&#34; camera lens needs serious improvement. I love wide lens, but this one is a big disappointment. 
5520 Love it. The ball joint is my favorite feature. Love the construction, feels well built but super light-weight. Quickmount is a bit tough to get on and off. 
5521 Good 
5522 Working like a champ! 
5523 Works Like the Nikon Battery. Camera Shows the Information about the state of the battery. So Far NO Problems. 
5524 These are great lens cleaning cloths. I bought extra so that I could keep some in each backpack and my travel case. They also make great presents for all your friends that shoot Canon 
5525 This camera is junk, I could never get it too work. If you re looking I would definitely pass on this one. 
5526 Good thanks 
5527 Doesn t work with Sigma DP1s 
5528 did not work as expected. returned 
5529 The system works great. The DVR was easy to hook up and installion of the cameras was a breeze. 
5530 Great Product for the Price. I ordered a backup since the price was reasonable. 
5531 Great case for what I needed 
5532 Good product. Nice to take it. Confortable. 
5533 Great little camera for snorkeling. Has a nice secure lock on the battery cover and takes great underwater photos at shallow depths. 
5534 Works just as well or better than the original Canon battery. Using in Canon G3 X camera. 
5535 Brilliant. Just with turning on the two modules are connected within seconds. It works perfectly and the scope (complies with what the manufacturer says) is more than enough for the task for which I need it. Always carry spare batteries just in case. 
5536 photo instructions are NO value. There is no visible way to connect the wires to the power terminals. 
5537 It arrive quickly and was exactly as described in listing. 
5538 it s alright 
5539 Working just fine with my GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition. 
5540 Loved it. Exactly what I needed. Thanks 
5541 Brilliant quality, used underwater and it floated perfectly, even with the weight of the GoPro. Loved the design, would definitely recommend. 
5542 wish the remote came with a cord. The tripod is a lil flimsy but it s a quick fix 
5543 as expected, but it has 9 leg clamps to go full extension. 
5544 Great product, easy to install 
5545 These portfolios are ideal for things you care about. I ve been pleased with everyone that I have purchased. They will hold a lot of material in a minimum of space. 
5546 Excelente 
5547 It s okay. Lots of good information, but I still find myself googling and youtubing things to find out more simplified versions of this information. I ll keep it, but it s still a bit above my beginner s level. 
5548 It only lasted a few months and it no longer holds a charge. The original battery that came with my camera is still going strong after three years. Over $36.00 and I had to throw it away. 
5549 The lens stopped working in a year. 
5550 the reason this is not a 5 Star is that the clip does not rotate.. so it s only adjustable in one direction. For the price I paid, I really expected more flexibility. otherwise, it s a great product and seems to be something that will stand up to use. 
5551 Great Charger, very compact and for a great price! 
5552 Good quality photos! 
5553 Great deal for this!, shipping fast and product works awesome now I have 3 batteries all the time ready to go in my Go Pro. 
5554 Love it works really good 
5555 Try this. Wrap the clip with masking tape or some soft tape. Mount the GoPro camera on and bite the mount. Film from mouth level and use the remote to take pics. Helpful? 
5556 Great service, I got exactly what I asked for. 
5557 Good quality 
5558 camera is awesome great point and shoot! 
5559 Great price for this timer. I used with my Canon 7D to create a time lapse video of a remodeling project in my home. It s easy to use, has an on-off switch, and uses standard batteries. I highly recommend it and would buy it again. 
5560 Not what I was expected, to cheap. 
5561 The best! 
5562 I have 2 of these units they are great for the money im also thinking of getting another one for my winter home in florida. 
5563 Very pleased with product and service 
5564 The product itself is good but I do not receive the rubber pad neither the top rubber cover 
5565 Works (and looks) just like the Nikon original HB-69 lens hood for a fraction of the price. People that have issues mounting the hood (too loose....?!?!?) need to turn it just a tad further until it clicks securely into place. No complaints at this price!!! 
5566 Arrived quickly works fine 
5567 I used this a lot 
5568 My purchase was for a replacement, lost the charger. This charger and the batteries are excellent. The service time was short, I am happy. Thank you 
5569 Haven t used it yet bought it to replace one I broke that belonged to someone else. The one I broke has problem fitting in the holder and s tr staying steady. 
5570 Gives connection error after a few clicks.. 
5571 Great product. Prompt delivery. 
5572 Awesome investment ! Great quality for a low price ! 
5573 It filled up with water and sunk the first time I used it. 
5574 Work great so far. I love not having to worry about the lens cap. 
5575 The unique filter. Excellent effect. The criteria are different, but I liked it very much. I suppose that it gives a different effect on different lenses. 
5576 great 
5577 [[VIDEOID:32726b0daee64c9d77072690c0baf647]]Unfortunately just a few days outside the one month return window the camera broke. The record button no longer works. Since I cannot return it I took it apart and the button is stuck in its housing so it is not fixable. 
5578 THIS THING DOESNT COME WITH THE REQUIRED 12V POWER ADAPTER!!!!!! I don t know how well it works yet. Gotta buy a power source...... lame 
5579 Excellent 
5580 Works great with my Hero Three! Holds a charge longer than the original battery and charge time is pretty quick. Great deal for the price! 
5581 Good quality. Seems solid. I like the ability to unsnap and resnap it from the camera quickly rather than having to fully remove the tether. It floats a Olympus Tough TG-4. 
5582 Unhappy with stiffness 
5583 Everything arrived on time and in great condition. The bag straps, however, are starting to fall apart, so will have to buy a new bag very soon. I strongly recommend persons buying this to have a backup bag as well. 
5584 good quality 
5585 as advertised... delivered on time... no disappointing surprises... will consider the company s products first if they offer what I need... THANKS, J 
5586 Size was perfect for my Sony Alpha a5000. It is thicker than expected compared to ones I have purchased for other devices. Instructions are a little lacking which could prove to be a problem for anyone lacking experience installing this types of screen protectors. 
5587 This worked perfectly for my camera and I got it really fast!! I was hesitant to buy this one because it was so much cheaper than the others, but I got it anyway and it works perfectly!! Very happy with my purchase! 
5588 Thanks. Bluetooth doesnt work but i loved everything else 
5589 Good product, nice quality. Compatible with Logitech C920 
5590 Not having an ON/OFF switch and having to take out the batteries is only negative feedback I can provide. Everything else is as advertised. Extremely happy with purchase. 
5591 Works great 
5592 good quality 
5593 Batteries hold charge and i can use the battery charger in my car..love it 
5594 Love my camera back pack and how it can hold soo much. I now have a larger laptop but still pack this bag for long trips so I will still have it. 
5595 Great price but the rubber eyecup pulled loose from the plastic frame and had to be glued before I attached it to my camera. 
5596 We have been using these for only a few months now and already one of the two we bought is dead, will not hold a charge. UGH! 
5597 This was a great purchase - but 8 months later, it s completely stopped working. 
5598 Great package and price, fast service and works very well. 
5599 I ve been using Lithium batteries in place of alkaline for many devices--especially those that I tend to overlook for long periods of time. Time may prove different, but I ve yet to have a leakage problem with these. 
5600 Do what they need to do, great little piece of equipment. 
5601 Just received these so have not had enough time to compare with other, similar, cloths. However, the quality appears to be excellent and they are more than large enough to handle almost any cleaning requirement. 
5602 Works just like it is supposed to. Does not come with detailed instructions for recording/motion detector settings but works well. 
5603 Good all around! 
5604 Great price for what u get! 
5605 A lot of quality equipment for the price! 
5606 Works as advertised. No problems nor issues. 
5607 loved therm 
5608 Works Great!! 
5609 Everything was as promised. Thanks! 
5610 It did not work, I had to return it and get my money back. 
5611 Thanks! My cam is working again! 
5612 Works well. 
5613 Didn t fit at all on my Camileo X100 video camera. Difficult to find the right cap for that. Universal means it should fit, right? 
5614 Some of the parts are useful , most I found won t fit the camera,poor engineering I believe, stick with the go pro accessories! The case as far as I can see was not made to hold the camera securely and not well thought out. 
5615 These frames are cheap plastic and they do NOT work! I ve been trying to get the company to take them back and give me a refund, to no avail! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT! COMPLETE RIP OFF! And lousy customer service. 
5616 Everything I expected... 
5617 Just what I needed and at a great value. 
5618 The Macro lens is pretty amazing. The fish eye isn t as good. 
5619 Works great with my S3000, recharges and downloads. 
5620 This lens is absolutely amazing. I use it primary for family photos, cooking images and video interviews. It brings out vibrant colors, textures and depth of field that I ve never been able to achieve before. It s worth every penny! 
5621 There was no audio coming from the camera. 
5622 My first security cameras, easy to install and simple to use. Only wish I could zoom in and out. 
5623 Yes. It was just what I was looking for to replace my very old one which was broken. In fact, the new Spinning Photo Cube is far better than the old one I had to replace. Thank you, Amazon! 
5624 great 
5625 Loved everything in this pack, all fun goodies to go with my camera. It came on time and in excellent condition! 
5626 My daughter loved the film itself. She s a pretty big Disney fan. The pictures are so cutE 
5627 more than pleased ... great. exactly as advertized ... super easy setup 
5628 Just as described--and just what I needed--with perfect shipping! Thanks so much! 
5629 JUST WHAT I WANTED 
5630 No comments 
5631 Excellent 
5632 Worked great! 
5633 Cannot recommend. Shoe would not even fit in my Nikon. 
5634 Did not charge my camera :( 
5635 Very practical to have on hand. 
5636 Fits perfectly and matches the textured finish on the lens. Don t be alarmed by the tiny gap as any light entering from the side is not going to affect your image. 
5637 This seems to work just fine, as well as the factory brand, for a lot less money. Recommended. 
5638 Great camera! Love that it is light weight and takes great pictures! Received on time and in great condition! 
5639 East setup and installation, Excellent color and clarity. 
5640 received in time 
5641 pleased 
5642 Very fast shipping! Exactly what I needed 
5643 took a while to get here, but thats ok 
5644 I use this camera whenever I shoot landscapes and it has never failed me. It s quite durable and the images it produces are razor sharp. 
5645 Very pleased with the camera so far. 
5646 It is sturdy and built well. Relatively light weight. I have no complaints really. 
5647 Good 
5648 Seems to work fine although it is a bit bulky for what it actually does.... 
5649 priced great, car plugin is great. 
5650 Just what I needed. Promptly shipped. Good price. 
5651 Less than 80 degree tilt what in the world would you use this for? Staring at the ground? 
5652 Thank you for the case the product looks and feel amazing 
5653 Thumps up for you 
5654 excellent, very nice company to deal with. 
5655 I like the FloatPro! It s easier to put on and more comfortable than the chest strap I have. I also positions the camera higher and that helps avoid frequent views of my paddleboard paddle. 
5656 HI I BUY OTHER LENS THEN I TAKE PICTURE THE PICTURE IS STILL BLUR THE CAMERA NOT FOCUS GOOD WHAT CAN I DO NOW THE CAMERA STILL GUARANTY CAN I RETURN THE CAMERA 
5657 This camera is loaded with more features than I have mastered yet. It takes excellent pictures, even in low light. I bought a factory reconditioned one so i added a 2 warranty as a precaution. 
5658 Was okay for the price, you can get more shots of film for less if you really do your research. 
5659 Great product with super fast shipping. 
5660 I got this case for my Raspberry Red camera and the colors don t match. The case is darker than the camera. I think this is a great protective case, the only problem is that the camera is hard to take out sometimes but overall this is great 
5661 Cheap, but you get what you pay 
5662 Nice quality bag, stylish and perfect way to store and carry your camera while on the go. 
5663 Great deal! Thank you! Love the kit. 
5664 My camera did not fit on the tripod and it was a Instax camera! 
5665 Fits great! Would buy from this seller again :) 
5666 The case is fine but it did not protect my camera lens when the bag got dropped. Now that I had to purchase a new lens, I am also purchasing a more protective case. 
5667 These are awesome mounts, I have one on my bike helmet and one on my kayak helmet. Look out YouTube the next sports sensation is on his way. HA! 
5668 Very disappointing 
5669 Lever broke almost instantly making it unusable. Flimsy construction. Total waste of money. 
5670 Nice backup for my original battery. A charge lasts well. 
5671 Exactly what I wanted, without the added cost. Fits my Canon lens perfectly. 
5672 It is really easy to control and the battery life is impressive. 
5673 Great value. 
5674 It will fit the a7rii, but you will have to fit it upside down. The borders are thinner on the left side. Right side-up and it will cover a very small part of the screen. Otherwise, the size of the entire screen protector is the correct dimensions. 
5675 Using it in Costa Rica right now! Great purchase to protect my investment. 
5676 Good cap wrong size. 
5677 works perfectly 
5678 awful. don t buy it. 
5679 Great mini quad. You will not be disappointed for the price. Have fun and fly safe. 
5680 The product is great and very versatile, but the zippers are low quality. The stitching at the ends does not prevent you from pulling the zipper all the way off of the end. (this happened to me on one side) 
5681 This case is amazing. I bring my drone on the plane when I travel about once a month. This is a solid case that fits all of my accessories and looks great. The handle and wheels are great and it is easy to move while traveling. 
5682 I love it It is great 😁👍👌 
5683 I had a soft box just sitting around because it wouldn t fit any of my lights. This universal ring allowed me to finally put it to use , and surprising works even better than the standard rings with other lights. 
5684 Much better than the original one i had, it s super bright, superb CRI, wonderful size, just wish there was a soft box included or as an option 
5685 Great Camera and with everything that comes with the bundle a great bang for ya buck....Camera takes great pic s even for an amateur like me 
5686 It provides the best exposure. I don t have to perform any white balance correction on my images. 
5687 Shipped on time. Works ok 
5688 Great camera 
5689 Very smooth fluid head. only issue is when you are panning left or right the base seems to click or pop like it isn t lubricated well enough. That s the reason for the four stars. 
5690 Did seem to be able to hold a charge as long as OEM GoPro batteries. Typically would get 45-50 minutes out of goPro battery compared to 30-40 minutes with these on my Hero 3 Blk 
5691 protects my camera holds accessories 
5692 after two months my video on my smart phone is connecting to someone else s camera I don t know where in the world! App crashes every single time 
5693 I shoot at times with five flashes. A lot to keep track of but it will do several more. Works every time except when I made a mistake. OOPS 
5694 This GoPro is as barebones as you can get, you will eventually need to upgrade though as I did since you can t record quality audio with this. It is just a regular point and shoot GoPro 
5695 better than what i thought. 
5696 Nice nocs. Nothing spectacular but they are great for the price. I have had no complaints with these. 
5697 excellent 
5698 Versatile, you can use the shoulder strap or place it on your hip. 
5699 Excellent product. I would order again thank you 
5700 [[VIDEOID:6b380c4d9dc4ade4c4475b347444e5c8]]This is an amazing camera. Small looks expensive and works great the best I have found in amazon. SJ4000 Sports Cam Best GoPro Alternative! Here is my driving test https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMd1XBk9zpo 
5701 Bought it for my husband. He loves this camera. Very easy for people who are not technology smart to learn. 
5702 Using this for cave photography/video very pleased with the results. 
5703 As advertised 
5704 every thing that I hoped it would be and more 
5705 Works well. No issues so far. 
5706 Than I imagined to be small, but the price is very good! 
5707 Worked once for me, doesn t stick on the dashboard, it dropped my camera not too happy about that but it s very disappointing cause I really wanted one guess I will have to just do without. 
5708 Great Product 
5709 The build quality is good, but I found that I had to really torque the knobs to hold the camera. That said, it met my needs for a stable mount for my camera. 
5710 The bag didn t even come close to holding the camera. Very disappointed. 
5711 It was perfect. I use it as a screen for my phone camera with my drone. 
5712 amazing heavy stand, holds my Kupo baby boom rock solid 
5713 This camera is amazing!! It s so adorable, perfect for the hello kitty lover in your family. Take some getting used to with the different settings but easy to follow. I would highly recommend. 
5714 very heavy and cant take off the head 
5715 Great price 
5716 Works as advertised. Perfect fit to my scope. 
5717 The time stamp wouldn t deactivate when I chose &#34;no date.&#34; Everything else was great, but I don t want a time/date stamp on all my videos, so I sent it back. 
5718 It was good while it lasted but it stopped working 2 months and so, now it was a complete waste of money. 
5719 Super cute shinny film. Perfect for a young girl or for a birthday party. Fast delivery 
5720 great product 
5721 Runs great. Install was relatively easy. Nice green light. 
5722 seemed like it was going to be a little bigger than I expected but still cute and pictures come out very clear loved it 
5723 The quality of the camera isn t the best but it s fun to use and it works great! 
5724 Works perfectly. Modified it to add an autoguiding port using shoestringastronomy.com s GPUSB and instructions! Allowed me to turn my Celestron CG-4 mount into an autoguiding mount for astrophotography. 
5725 This is a great camera! 
5726 Excellent product and service 
5727 Reasonably priced, items as described, arrived when promised. Seller recommended. 
5728 Product delivered as described and pictures. It was a nice surprise to see felt cases provided with each lense. 
5729 Good 
5730 The product does a great job but very difficult to setup. I would suggest the plug and play do you don t have to play with the router setting. Does not work with the app as I have to go through IP 
5731 very good material 
5732 Much easier to set up wirelessly than previous camera I had. MyDlink gives great connection to device. 
5733 Great value. I use my GoPros on my motorcycles and the lenses get chipped easily. I needed to replace the lenses and these were great fit perfect. 
5734 its so great to have extra batteries for the Go Pro, especially when you don t have the time or place to charge! 
5735 Smooth transaction. Fast shipping. A+++. Thanks you!!! 
5736 good 
5737 Study design and bundle to have. I don t have to worry anymore about adapters. 
5738 Best thing I ve bought in a while! I love thus camera! 
5739 great just need to be build a little better 
5740 Perfect! Works with camera and charger as well as the original battery. 
5741 It s pricey, but it works well. I got it so I wouldn t have to worry about losing the lens cap. 
5742 Good value 
5743 Great shipping product wasn t that great. 
5744 Perfect! I would like to purchase from Goja again if I need other related products. 
5745 This case is a great size and holds a few extras like batteries and cables. 
5746 What s really to say about micro fiber cloths? Excellent quality, cheap and useful! 
5747 Great battery. I was the second photographer for a wedding with a 5d mark ii. I took close 1,000 shots and this wasn t even half dead yet. I m glad I found these batteries and was able to pick up plenty of backups for a great price. Highly Recommend. 
5748 GREAT! Great price, service & product 
5749 Very nice and useful product! Used along with Mogopod, they are a great pair, and make great videos. 
5750 charger works well 
5751 What a wonderful product. The cloth is beautiful, and so soft. The picture is beautiful and perfect. 
5752 Great Product 
5753 Would not work with my camera/lens. 
5754 Surprisingly works better than expected. It works as expected. Was a little tight when initially closing while latched to the camera but I like that. In my head it seems as if it s just a tighter latch 
5755 I love everything about this bag except the fabric. There is more than enough room for my camera and necessary purse items. I love the pocket for a water bottle. The removable camera bag is excellent. I would just like a different fabric. 
5756 Best aftermarket batteries I have found as replacements for the Sony NP-FM500H 
5757 Love the hero 4 
5758 Was delivered quickly and received all the items in one shipment which was very nice. 
5759 Awesome 
5760 Pretty much disappointed in bebop drone 
5761 1000 down the drain. 
5762 While not a disaster, it s nothing sensational. Basically, the 3 stars is the middle of the ratings and this set is pretty much middle of the pack for digital backgrounds. Draped Muslin is probably the worst collection in the batch. 
5763 works great 
5764 The lamp and light is great... just be careful when installing the batteries. As you remove the battery cover and replace it, it is VERY EASY to break two of the prongs that hold the cover onto the base of the light. 
5765 Worked great out of the box. Although I must admit the software works much better with Windows than with Apple. 
5766 Unusable. Plastic flexes rather than grips. 
5767 It s a good option for indoor moments 
5768 Amazing bundle. This is the best bundle I have seen on Amazon and I look forward to purchasing another one for sure. :) 
5769 Great Bag.!! for my canon 6D with 24-106 lens and laptop 
5770 This case is everything I needed and wanted. 
5771 Is a very good camera, considering the good price. Is as well as a gopro but cheaper 
5772 Great deal! Very durable! I m really enjoying this convenient way of carrying my lenses and camera! 
5773 Sharp lens. Would like to have a few more markings on the lens and controls. 
5774 Duds...batteries don t fully charge 
5775 Excellent transaction and you could not tell that camera had been reconditioned. Love the red color and easy to spot the camera. Works fine and happy to have it. Would buy more items from this vendor. 
5776 excelent , no problem 
5777 Does the job. Just remember to select the correct range. 
5778 Excellent Product. Charges Fast. Reliable. 
5779 Excellent mini-tripod base for using while Periscoping. Very good balance for my iPhone 6. 
5780 The I have had this camera for exactly 47 days and the lens is already making a weird &#34;zipper noise&#34; whenever the lens extends. Not only is this affecting my audio, but I fear the problem is only going to get worse.. 
5781 Excellent information and presented in a useful way. Thanks 
5782 Fun camera. Very easy to use. The ability to change the focus point after the photo was been snapped is awesome. The lens cap is easy to lose though. 
5783 great case fits all my accessories with gopro 
5784 Just what i was looking for! At The right price! 
5785 It was a gift to my boyfriend!! 
5786 Good product! Great price. 
5787 I use both of these with my Canon water/shock proof camera. One will keep it afloat, but I like the extra security of having 2. Attached both to the mounting loop and I can just let the camera float in the water safely. They do not soak up water. 
5788 It was amazing to wear it in a 31km trail race in Switzerland with the Chest mount harness and didn t even notice it. Even took it sideways during some of the cliffs to shoot them while running. 4 1/2 hours and not one issue even during the rain............Love it! 
5789 certainly love this lens! 
5790 I like them 
5791 So happy that everything I ve tried in my purchase so far has worked and is of good quality. Great deal! 
5792 This does not work at all with the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 I bought at the same time. I want to return it. 
5793 Purchased for shooting H.S. Volleyball action. Just what I was looking for. 
5794 Too small to be functional/useful. Camera fits, but nothing else. 
5795 Scratches kind of easily so it does get hard to see the actual screen. However that said, it is clearly doing its job by protecting the main screen. 
5796 I like it, it is what it says it is. However, it s a little fragile, so handle with care. 
5797 I could not see any improvement from normal phone lens. 
5798 It works great and looks great. The screws are very low quality, i would use your own screws if attaching to wood. 
5799 great deal. exactly as expected! 
5800 Great attachment to have 
5801 I love it and recommend this product to everyone. Thank you. 
5802 Very well, including underwater, except that there is no lens cover 
5803 Maximum allowable size, heavy duty rolling suitcase for your gear. It was super helpful on my last overseas trip. I was confident it would fit carry on baggage limits, confident it would protect my gear, and it was really convenient rolling out the plane and in the terminal etcetera. 
5804 Awesome product!! 
5805 Super easy to set up. Great picture. THE FUTURE IS NOW! 
5806 Not beginner friendly at all. I ve been trying to balance it for almost 4 hours now, didn t work at all. Still trying, looked at the CD, every tutorial on youtube. I find it impossible 
5807 great camera, no issues 
5808 Came off and left a permanent residue on my screen. 
5809 Love that it connects to my DLNA media sever but keeps loosing connection with it. Trying to figure out how to keep it more consistent. Picture quality is fantastic and love the functionality. 
5810 Couldn t get it to work properly. Would up in the trash with my old one. 
5811 Works as advertised. 
5812 Excelente 
5813 works great cant beat the price 
5814 thank you 
5815 I am glad that it came with two. After a couple hours of use. The string that loops around your waterproof camera began to fry, deeming it useless if you lose your camera anyways. I would recommend purchasing a better quality floatation device for your camera/what have you. 
5816 Great tool for price. It would be a plus if timer had on/off switch. 
5817 cannon lens works great. 
5818 It doesn t prevent from shaking and swinging while walking and filming. 
5819 Very handy and works ! 
5820 Nice clear picture. Easy install with longest time taken to route cable. 
5821 great entry telephoto lens 
5822 nice case. could use a little more pocket room for extra cords 
5823 it did not work well it only work for 15 mini and that is all 
5824 It broke the first time I used it. 
5825 Really good mic! I m very impressed 
5826 Great buy on these. Decided to get extra batteries and charger for my Ghostpro camera. 
5827 Good product, prompt delivery 
5828 Works great, worth more than what I paid for it. 
5829 Well made, feels like a tank. Perfect flash for me. 
5830 100% advisable 
5831 The best! 
5832 Excellent 
5833 Great product it is my first stabilizer, its all about practice. 
5834 If you need an extra battery for your Canon Vixia hf 500r. Order this. 
5835 Very happy with the replacement. Only issue I ve had is if you don t dry it properly after submersion, the non-aluminum metal clip will start to rust. 
5836 Awesome! 
5837 ok 
5838 Nice build quality. It can charge larger battery too. 
5839 Was sent quickly hover charger was not correct model. Both batteries were correct howe ve charger did not fit these batteries. 
5840 Nicer charger than the one originally supplied with my Fuji X100T. Batteries hold a charge nicely & perhaps as long or longer than the original Fuji battery. I d recommend this brand to anyone looking for a replacement. 
5841 Beware! This third party Seller does DOES NOT ALLOW ANY RETURNS!!! Make sure this cable is compatible with your particular camera - is works with only select Canon digital cameras. 
5842 I LOVE IT CANT WAIT TO REALLY GET STARTED ON TAKES SOME MORE PICS 
5843 This is a trippy little thing- Gonna take some learning to master but it is well made and works well. A poor man s steadicam! When you get this take some time to learn it and you will be happy! 
5844 ive had this accessory pack for over a month and still continuing to find things that I can use my gopro for! 
5845 Very good camara 
5846 I love it! The pictures of Winnie the Pooh and tiger and eeyore are so adorable! Buying again! 
5847 Perfect! Keeps my camera afloat! 
5848 Used for FPV quad racing. Image quality for FPV is poor. Onboard recording is really good quality but that doesn t translate to good picture quality over a wireless FPV link. Do yourself a favor and use the RunCam 600TVL as our FPV camera. HUGE difference! 
5849 Very good lens at a reasonable price. 
5850 I bought 2 batteries and one did not perform like it was supposed to. I contacted the seller and they sent me 2 more batteries. I am happy! 
5851 Excellent for low light street photos. 
5852 Great product for my iPhone 6 plus! 
5853 Does the job. The fit is a bit tight, as other people have noted, but not too much. All my lenses have managed to get in and out of it ok. 
5854 Simple to install and does what it is supposed to. 
5855 The camera arrived really fast and I am really exited. Ran to my house and took some pictures with it and the photos are AMAZING. Thanks for the amazing service, fast shipping and an amazing camera!! 
5856 WOW! Both my husband and I wear glasses. I have been looking FOREVER to find a product which cleans glasses without leaving the glasses in worse condition with smudges, prisms, and streaks. I have FINALLY found that product. Amazing! 
5857 Couldn t wait to get this and I was pleased! Everything I expected. 
5858 Makes carrying the camera around so much easier. 
5859 This Casio EX -FC150 is everthing that was advertised. From the slow motion which was the main reason why I got it to the snapshot still camera feature. 
5860 It s a good product for biggner who just started but I think there are much better ones to use. 
5861 Great camera with an easy to use interface. Only problem is that it doesn t come with an SD/memory card. 
5862 Excellent desicion. 
5863 Cameras finally arrived and were as advertised 
5864 Instructions easy to follow. Straight forward to set up internet connection. Only drawback - camera s are outdoor rated, but the power supply transformer requires 120 volt AC is indoor rated. 
5865 Awesome!. Bought for photography business -works great with cannon Mark 5Diii JaneB 
5866 no problems at all, easiest to set up, and I have set up other brands, excellent amount of components. enough for most homes, the extra siren was a real surprise 5 star rating for sure 
5867 Gerat lens, sharp. Weird how tight the focusing barrel is. Had read about it but in practicality is not very good. I only got rid of the lens because I found a Sony 10-18mm for a good deal. 
5868 fast delivery service, arrived just as expected! 
5869 like 
5870 This cable works perfectly and is rugged enough to last a while, very similar to actual Nikon cable. 
5871 Looks slightly cheap, but if placed high enough, no one can tell. 
5872 awesome camera, works great, great price and got it fast 
5873 Very nice camera 
5874 Love the camera! It is small enough to fit in my purse or beach bag, but takes great pictures. 
5875 I hate to scratch the lcd display on my camera - attaching this gives me peace of mind and I can keep my camera in a pocket so it is handy. It is cheap insurance to protect the display - easy to install and easy to change if required. 
5876 Camera did not make clear pictures and did not satisfy me. Very blurry images and wasted very expensive film on this. very disappointed in my purchase. 
5877 these are amazing! no need to bring along bulky lighting systems with you... you don t even need a flash on your camera!! harness the natural light of the sun! 
5878 Perfect, have a couple of these 
5879 My twin granddaughters are getting for their birthday and are thrilled. 
5880 The software is a little buggy (the notification checkmark doesn t appear to ever be really clear about what state it s in, and sometimes the video just won t load), but the hardware is excellent and very discrete. 
5881 Works Great, I m very happy with it! 
5882 Wobbly. Great for stationary video. Terrible for anything in on the go. The clamp is fine, but the swivel mechanism wobbles. 
5883 Awesome mount for my ATV 
5884 Does not work 
5885 When you buy Sony you don t have to worry. 
5886 fit for my Fuji X100S camera 
5887 I just got this camera and it s awesome. Remember to buy the memory card separate though. It looks, feel and handles perfectly. Worth every darn penny 
5888 Works great. no problems so far. 
5889 I am very happy with the whole package. I am impressed with the Nikon camera, since I ve only owned Canon. All the accessories were a huge bonus. The price was exceptional for all that I got. 
5890 I love these the only thing I can complain about is the price but that s not Amazon s fault they are expensive everywhere you go. 
5891 Great light for video And for the price you can t go wrong 😉 
5892 Great camera. Easy to use and it takes great pictures. 
5893 great buy 
5894 These work great and for the price you can t go wrong. truthfully I never thought they d work considering the price difference between this and a pocket wizard, and yes the wizard is nicer and was more features, these things work and work really well. 
5895 Excellent quality of vidieos and pictures. Very good resource when at work and recreational use. 
5896 ok 
5897 Nice edition to a golf cart. 
5898 could not find any better product than this one. It s really great and accurate would recommend anyone to buy this especially for the wonderful price dead cheap and very good quality materials. 
5899 Excellent product! Extremely satisfied! 
5900 great deal and service 
5901 Best float strap for any camera. I use it for my gopro with a go poll attached and it still floats 
5902 Great camera we love it! 
5903 Very good Superb quality lens for 300 focal length ! 
5904 Awesome 
5905 Perfect size. 
5906 Very nice camera, easy to use and to handle, very user friendly, comfortable and cute. 
5907 Great product! 
5908 I have had this charger for over 3 years. It has always worked well, plugs into any slot. I take it with me when I go on vacation or when I know my battery needs a little juice. 
5909 Doesn t look like the photo at all, came in a reddish color and the flap was completely flat without a circular indent for the lens like the picture shows. It s an OK case, just not what I expected or wanted 
5910 perfect replacement 
5911 Works as advertised. However wished they were not so flimisy. However they work if the glue sticky parts stay to the lens cap 
5912 Great product. Screw in easily and the rubber o-ring is great. You don t have to crank down as hard on the gopro to lock in desired angle. Also the screw threads in on first try. Great purchase 
5913 These offer a great alternative to the plan white background film. They are bright and fun. I would recommend getting these as I believe they are the same price as the white background. Just a way to add some color and pop to your pictures. 
5914 Love this strap 
5915 Awesome product. 
5916 excellent product, arrived on time, works great so far. i would purchase from this merchant again.very happy with this product, would recommend it to friends. 
5917 Saved by Ortho Litho film! 
5918 Product is good but i wish it had come with some camera tips video for newbies 
5919 I have owned this for less than a month and have discovered that it it used and only charges on one terminal i bought a duel charger which is not duel 
5920 I thought it would be a great gift for myself but find that it gets extremely hot. Battery life is less that a hour. I get great video at 4k but anything above is halting. I hope that they fix the heat problem and short battery life. 
5921 Gave it a one star because when I received it, it didn t work, if only it had a return address maybe I would give it a higher rating. 
5922 excellent product for and excellent price! 
5923 I use this whenever I use my underwater camera. I tested it in calm water first and it floated just fine. It s never slipped off so it hasn t been tested in the wild but I have no doubt it would work OK if it did. 
5924 Got every thing advertised in excellent codition 
5925 Good!! I love it so much!! 
5926 Got this for my birthday from my wife to upgrade the dinky factory bag that came with my camera bundle. I really like the amount of room this pack has and easy access for all of your go to accessories. 
5927 Great filter and works as described! 
5928 Works very well. 
5929 Great alternative to the camera strap. Only down side is it came with no instructions. Easy fix with youtube. 
5930 works great 
5931 Loved them 
5932 Worked great. 
5933 The quality is beyond poor…and there are Chinese characters on the back of the paper frame, the color is terrible as well. I threw them all. 
5934 You have to switch mounts everytime you use a phone or a gopro. Very time consuming. 
5935 Very comfortable 
5936 Great price 
5937 These are pretty nice but I have already lost one due to, I think, they are made flexible and not have a firm mounting. 
5938 Delivered on time and very happy with the product. 
5939 I don t like how the case has an embroidery of the name &#34;Katia&#34; on the side. 
5940 Great camera, takes very nice pictures. Love how its so portable. 
5941 Great cable does what it is supposed to at a great price. 
5942 A bit overpriced but well designed, and I use it constantly. 
5943 Worked perfectly. Exactly like the original. 
5944 These just run out of juice too fast!! Only last a couple of days!! 
5945 OUTSTANDING camera and a great buy! I highly recommend it!!! 
5946 Great product...as advertised. 
5947 Felt flimsy. Plastic, light weight. On/Off button sticks. Sent it back. 
5948 The image quality is great and it was easy to set up. Very easy to use too. My only complaint is the sound quality. We use it with our iphones and it sounds like you are talking through a tin can. Doesn t bother me enough to return it. 
5949 This product is great! Customer support is great! We had a problem with the wrist band, it broke, we sent an email with pic and they sent us a new pole immediately! Thank you! 
5950 everything I was expecting and more. I have had a great time taking pictures of old homes and wildlife 
5951 Good and nice for my camera 
5952 My wife absolutely loves these lens! She is extremely happy with this product. 
5953 Works great. 
5954 works well, only lost about a half stop of light using if. using it. Did not loose any image quality with this filter. 
5955 Memory card and filters and bag useful, the tripod cheap crap 
5956 The pack is kind of heavy, but that is to be expected for 23000 mAh. It works well and charges my Surface Pro 3 and Tab 4 with power to spare. 
5957 Great addition to my GoPro accessories 
5958 Works well as long as you re not in cold weather. 
5959 Works great 
5960 Very nice travel case! 
5961 Works good on LG G4. Even bought the huge Love Mei heavy duty case and it just opened up far enough to fit. 
5962 The product is really very portable and convenient, very helpful to my work. 
5963 Broke after one year. 
5964 Ordered several of these for officers at the police department. They work great, good size to keep with you, and take good pictures. Overall, it s a good little camera for the money and serves the purpose well. 
5965 The mounts are good but the screws that come with it are weak (two sheared in half). So my advice is to buy better screws separately. 
5966 Did not work at all. 
5967 High quality piece! 
5968 Quality image fair 
5969 Thanks I m enjoying my filters 
5970 Quite stable appears to be well made 
5971 After period of time batteries slipped out of slot while charging. 
5972 Great 
5973 It is a bit larger than I expected but rock solid when in use. Very easy to adjust with a Nikon D2x and all lens that I have tried so far (from a 10mm up to 80-200mm). 
5974 The product NEVER worked. Battery wouldn t hold a charge and the zoom wouldn t work. Couldn t get any decent pictures. Photos all disappeared every time the battery died. Who thought this one up? 
5975 I was using the macro ring flash, the macro lens and my canon camera for my profesional dentistry practice. Works great, fine quality pictures. Very usefull in my dental office. 
5976 Great little camera, gets the job done. 
5977 i got it turned out i didnt need it.but it worked great 
5978 great value 
5979 I have a canon rebel t2i, this charger works great for my battery. 
5980 Sort of pricey but it does work very well and makes the lens much more user friendly. 
5981 nice in theory. Not able to wrap hand around camera and still use shutter button with out loosening grip. 
5982 Perfect glass which provides excellent depth of field! 
5983 Silly product and has no sleeve. VERY disapointing. 
5984 just what we needed at a good price 
5985 Looks and feels great.Haven t used it yet 
5986 Now I can use mine video recorder... I am one handed. 
5987 It fits on both Sony and Sigma E lenses. Doesn t fall off and screws on smoothly. 
5988 The cameras work well - and far - during daylight hours. We were so surprised at how well the cameras worked at night! The LEDs do produce a blinding glare if reflecting near glass (or behind glass), but if you can hang them appropriately, they work great at night. 
5989 good seller, I recomend 
5990 This item was an excellent addition to my videography kit, it allowed me to make smoother more professional shots. 
5991 I love this camera can t wait to purchase another one. 
5992 I love these battery pouches. They are perfect for my Sony batteries. 
5993 AAAAA+++++ 
5994 The color is pretty poor, but it s light and tiny and cheap. 
5995 Good! It is as described. I ve used it a few times and it s very comfortable to hold. You do get what you pay for so keep in mind this is not a high end grip. 
5996 Neat 
5997 Stopped working after a week. Should have installed it earlier to enable processing of refined... instead, sat on the dining room table for a month prior to installation... 
5998 I bought it after I read good reviews from several books. You can get more info about the meter usage from Youtube. 
5999 very Packaging bad and quality bad 
6000 All ready malfunctioning 
6001 Good case 
6002 Great camera that I put to use the minute it arrived. Works beautifully and great pictures! 
6003 Fast and true to listing. 
6004 Works great on bikes and golf cart! 
6005 Very nice product, you can see everything nice and clear and feet any were you want. 
6006 Complete scam, f n cons, false advertising,...get a rope! 
6007 cant return and has not user manual!! 
6008 Works as intended 
6009 Love this camera strap, and have gotten a ton of compliments on it! Great quality as well! 
6010 great products. Thanks 
6011 Good but too small 
6012 Perfect fit for my Kodak camera and my computer to download!! Sent right away and packed well!! 
6013 good 
6014 I believe that this lens will get a high rating once I begin using. Had rotator cuff shoulder surgery and have not used as of yet. 
6015 Great value 
6016 Perfect! Highly Recommended ☺ 5 ★ STARS ★ Thanks! A+ 
6017 ok 
6018 battery it s very good, didn t fully tested for longer periods of time but so far seems to be at least the same with the original. 
6019 Fit and worked perfectly and super fast shipping! 
6020 Great walking around lens! 
6021 Seems to fit a little loose and can easily come unplugged - Olympus must know this because they supply a velcro band to attach to your tripod while using... With a little care, it stays in, and works well otherwise.... 
6022 Fortunately there support atrocious 
6023 good product works fine 
6024 Perfect as advertised. 
6025 Bought for my Sigma 150-600 S lens. This is better than using the cover that came with the lens when I am in the field. 
6026 Good quality, nicely packed, fair price, quick delivery. Great product! 
6027 Low quality. Globe just fell off after just a couple of days. 
6028 Extremely sturdy but definitely has some tilt smoothness issues. I only trust it for static b-cam shots. EDIT: The seller contacted me immediately upon receiving this review and put in incredible effort to see that I was cared for. I would not hesitate to purchase from them again. 
6029 Love my camera! 
6030 Switched from mirrorless APS-C to D750, best all around camera! 
6031 I had a hard time setting it up but Vincent from Technical support walked me through the setup and got it working. 
6032 Nice little case and it works great 
6033 Beyond expectations. Great value! This camera is awesome. So many unexpected extras. 
6034 AWESOME case for my gopro and accessories. Every gopro owner should have one of these! 
6035 The battery I received did not work even after hours of charging. The charger itself felt cheap and unreliable. 
6036 I m just starting off with my DSLR but this is an easy camera to use and takes really great pictures. I m still learning to use it but so far I like it. 
6037 Handy for when you camera is on the tripod. You ll have no movement in the camera for shots that are zoomed in, or with slow shutter speeds. 
6038 The was a very nice fabric back drop. No need to steam or iron either. The colors were vibrant and it looked just like the photo online. I would order a back drop from this company again. 
6039 Product arrived on time and was as described. Perfect condition. Thank you ;-) 
6040 0ne battery was dead and charger holding pin broke at the first try and can t hold battery uprigth. But Amazon Emailed me asking of it and I tell them about the battery and they had it replaced for free. Amazon takes care. 
6041 Awesome. Has made my experience with the x100t even better. Love this conversion! 
6042 Totally awesome ! Light weight and fit to any face ! The clarity is perfect ! 
6043 Great replacement for missing lens cover. Good value 
6044 worked good for taking pictures at a wedding 
6045 has already paid for itself in time, quality camera and power for testing cameras, sure beats running in and out of the house to check, just connect to the camera and see where it is pointed. quality tester 
6046 Inexpensive, but the image quality is lacking for a 3MP. It is laggish no matter the network and comes in grainy. I have it on a GB network. 
6047 I couldn t be happier with this product. I came to amazon looking for a quality product at a decent price and I definitely found it here. No complaints only praises here. Makes me proud to be an amazon shopper. 
6048 Within expectation. 
6049 A great bag. Plenty of space. Has side pockets for extra space. I bought two of them and hopefully they will last. 
6050 Seems to be good, but I haven t figured it out yet. It s higher tech than I am. 
6051 good product, so far very good 
6052 not verry usefull 
6053 Love this thing, almost take it everywhere with me. 
6054 I used it with my Kowa spotting scope at the shooting range. Worked great! Used it to photograph the northern likes with my Canon 70D. Worked great! 
6055 Not worth the money 
6056 Not as clear as hoped 
6057 Very good product for the price. Works well, has beginner and advanced mode witch helps when your learning. The camera works well too, audio recording was a surprise. 
6058 This camera is only meant to fill in spots with real cameras around. If this is the only camera, everyone will know it is fake after about a week. 
6059 Nice photos and solutions 
6060 Turned out fine. 
6061 So far this is the ultimate drone 
6062 Only disappointment was the built-in pop up flash will not work with this in place 
6063 Great Camera, and great seller 
6064 Gift for someone however they love it. 
6065 You get what you pay for. The very first day two of the clips to hold the legs extended snapped. Easily glued back together. You get what you pay for. 
6066 Signal as good as 50ft integrated cable. 
6067 Fast service, great product and price. 
6068 die too quick 
6069 love this Camera and will reorder from this company again. 
6070 Came on time and works well. 
6071 Very affordable, and easy to set up. 
6072 Amazing product. Great and easy way to carry an extra lens. 
6073 Good quality and good price. Very satisfied. 
6074 Within the first week, the main zipper broke. Within about a month all the smaller side pocket zippers were broken. Such a shame because this is a nice looking bag and otherwise sturdy. But you just can t use the bag with ALL zippers broken! 
6075 Does what it needs without any fuss. Connecting standard component receiver to plasma with BNC connection. 
6076 Got it for my 85 1.8 after a close call almost rubbing the lens on a broken fence when the cheesy hood popped off. Have not noticed any issues with glare or contrast issues. 
6077 having tons of fun with this bad boy! 
6078 Not ready for prime time. Very poor internet server. As with all internet accessible services, if the company shuts down, its server will and you will have nothing. 
6079 A great light pack, low cost Not wanting !!! to ruin your show off pack in the woods, forest, and dirty places we go to fly & film. This is the $30.00 pack to get... 
6080 awkward to use. 
6081 great deal. very fast shipment 
6082 All of them are good 
6083 Do not waste $12. Poor quality. Stitching for drawstring closure broke just after two days of use. Small pouch useless; too small 
6084 Great camera. 
6085 Batteries seem to have a long life and work well. Great inexpensive set! 
6086 god 
6087 works well 
6088 Not to bad, looks almost like my very expensoive real ones which are near to these, J R 
6089 this camera doesn t even have a mic port so how can it be for this camera? 
6090 Great camera. Does what I need and then some. Particularly love the built-in 42x zoom. Beach Camera provided great service - camera was delivered on time and as promised. 
6091 Very sharp, great for low light. Received it before estimated delivery date. 
6092 very cheap material compared to original but works fine 
6093 Cheap, useless camera. 
6094 I got what I expected. 
6095 Very good 
6096 DO NOT BUY ! I have 3 of these systems and on every system 2 cameras on each system went bad 
6097 If you know what is good fo you don t buy this junk. DON T BUY!!!!!!!!!!!! 
6098 Works fine! 
6099 have not fully tested how good they hold charge but seem Ok 
6100 excellent product and service 
6101 As a gift for a 7 year old boy this was a big hit. Easy to operate. The styrofoam type body won t hurt walls etc 
6102 Got these to hang a photo backdrop. They are lightweight but clamp well. 
6103 Love that all I need is the paper and do not have to worry about the ink. 
6104 Good product 
6105 the best drone i ve had up to date, just don t update firmware ! 
6106 Great in the field and easy to set up and transport. 
6107 I needed to file my helmet mount to make this fit. Once it fit, it was loose inside the mount and rattles slightly. Not a big deal, but not as expected. I plan on eventually buying the brain explodercreations.com version. Looks more thought out. 
6108 Gave it as bday present for my sister....she said it s perfectly amazing! 
6109 Just what I expected 
6110 SO SO SO glitchy. I only get this to record about 30% of the time. Battery life is s***. I hate this helmet camera, it has let me down so many times. 
6111 This is a great Security Camera. I really like it!! I had some issues with setting up my system. After calling Amcrest and working with Chris I was good to go. The Customer Service was amazing. Highly recommend this product! 
6112 I bought this filter because I have one just like it for my film cameras. This filter is excellent quality and works as it should. Here is the thing though, my Nikon does not seem to need it like my old film cameras do. 
6113 Great little batteries and charger! Charge 2 at once. 
6114 Very very small 
6115 Great camera. Love that it connects to my phone to save pictures. This makes it possible to print better quality pictures when resizing for large pictures. Highly recommend this camera to anyone! 
6116 i worked just as advertised, my go pro got knocked out of my boat at it floated fine and was easy to see for retrieval. 
6117 We needed to replace a broken light source and these worked well for us in the laboratory. I used one in our biohazard lab and the other in receiving. My people liked the adjustable light source. 
6118 Close ups with the macro look really good. Only 4 stars because I really believe the wide angle could be better. 
6119 Works great! Use for my gopro hero 4 and have not had any problems! 
6120 Worked as expected. 
6121 they work as advertised and they ve took plenty of hits and still no cracks 
6122 Very helpfull. I could not have done it myself.Thanks Dave 
6123 We are still learning how to use it, really wish it had come with instructions, but seems to be all it said to be 
6124 Arrived in good condition and is as advertised 
6125 This material is is extremely abrasive. Compared to the factory strap (only a few bucks more) it seems to be made from old pot scrubbers. 
6126 Flawless. 
6127 Awesome bag, my wife loves it. Many compartments, lot of storage space. 
6128 Great Value for quality of this camera - bought for my young son and he is loving it. 
6129 Its ok. the only bad thing is you have to make sure all the air is out of the space between the lens and the gopro. if not the footage would look like crap. 
6130 gets the job done, not great quality but works just fine 
6131 Terry Morgan was terrific on support for the 9826. He was very helpful with the excellent Foscam 9826... great cam quality with expert support 
6132 perfect! what I needed!!! 
6133 Easy to use and takes great pictures 
6134 liked it even better than the A77 I have now due to the lower weight and smaller size 
6135 Well built, doesn t smell like a cheap knock-off like some products do. Be aware that a Canon Rebel T5i and 2 lenses is a TIGHT fit! The interior is customizable as it comes with padded dividers. 
6136 Nice product! 
6137 FALSE ADVERTISING. This case does NOT fit Lumix camera, specifically the DMC-G6. This case is too small, and will not physically enclose the camera. Do not waste your time or money. RETURNED. 
6138 Simple installation. Quick disconnect guards are great. Only con is that they do affect speed. I also find that on windier days the guards tend to hinder the stability of the quadracopter. All in all a great product. 
6139 Great little connectors...my Camera hangs just right now! 
6140 delivered on time and as described 
6141 The monopod is made of good material, strong, but not heavy. I dive, and it s perfect for a good grip, since the handler is made of rubber. I think i made the best choice 
6142 Thank you 
6143 My Nikon stopped working. It wouldn t take a charge So I decided that I Needed a new battery. Put your battery in and it works like a charm now. Thanks 
6144 It is a very good compact camera 
6145 Great eye cups. Seems a little more snug than the others. Hated the first one broke and the 2nd one fell off. If you buy use a little glue to hold it 
6146 Threads fit perfectly. Quality is good -- no distortion as best I can tell. 
6147 The absolutely best 
6148 Bought for vacation and arrived one day before leaving. Small, light, and compact enough for pocket or purse. Easy enough to use without reading directions; however will have to use manual to get full benefit of camera options. Very happy with selection! 
6149 Fast delivery and it works 
6150 Even at $4 this is a waste of money. The cheap vinyl smells awful, there are loose threads, and the fit is cludgy. Immediately replaced it with a good quality strap for only $12. 
6151 Great! And fast! 
6152 On time! Highly recommend. 
6153 Included magnet. Used it to replace defective door sensor (ADT Safewatch Pro panel). Easy to program replacement S/N. 
6154 This adaptor works perfectly with my fuji x cameras. It allows to use both Nikon f and g lenses and even lets me control aperature on the g s. It also looks great and is well made. 
6155 Thank you 
6156 Very Nice!! Love it 
6157 Better than the scope from school, and you can take pics. Works good to keep the children occupied too :&#60;) 
6158 Really happy with them. Just what we were looking for! Good service and quick response. 
6159 Very easy to set up. Very easy to use. Very easy to pull videos to the computer. Nothing to complain about. It just works. 
6160 Very easy to use. It works great. No problems here. 
6161 Awesome fit for my Canon Rebel T3 
6162 Henry from their support team was very helpful. It was really quick to set up. The Foscam camera is great so far! 
6163 Good quality product. Unfortunately if you place a filter on the camera, this no longer fits... 
6164 This is VERY nice, not reflective and vibrant color. Also somewhat durable 
6165 Very easy to use and very effective also. If you slop food on it, you might need something different, but if you are not a sloppy eater you are good to go. Easy to fit in your bag. 
6166 Its what I wanted 
6167 Perfect for my Calumet 32 Softbox. 
6168 I had bought an expensive one that did not last for very long. I have since replaced with this one and it works perfect. 
6169 after several a few try s at setting this up and failing ( user error), I finally got it right. Its a cool little camera. 
6170 It meets my needs. 
6171 Very good quality product. It s heavy and long with heavy duty attachments. Great price for a such a nice piece. 
6172 work fine 
6173 Great picture and value for money. It is a very good camera , not heavy, its design makes it very practical. Its great in capturing those unexpected and funny moments. 
6174 Product was as advertised. 
6175 WORKS GREAT , LOOKS LIKE A REAL TV 
6176 Super solid, and really useful. Very happy. 
6177 Very good device. A significant improvement in functionality over those available a couple of years ago. 
6178 Fantastic lens ! 
6179 Manfrotto makes solid part. Not the most affordable of its kind, but it ll last a heck of a lot longer. 
6180 Excellent customer service! I had a minor issue and Zomei took care of it immediately. I recommend this company. 
6181 The 1-Port power switch is used with our web cameras and is a great product. 
6182 Amazing features for a little point and shoot. I m loving the 30x zoom! 
6183 It exceeded my expectations... 
6184 Good product and a fantastic seller A++++++ 
6185 not bad for used cameras did not want to upgrade as I have of these 
6186 Fits well on all my other cameras as well as the Canon. 
6187 I don t understand why you can t get the one which pops directly on instead, they have this Velcro held diffuser which flies off sometimes, no bueno, it works though ughhh 
6188 Menu comes up in chinese and the majority of the interface requires ActiveX. Not compatible with Linux. 
6189 Came with an EU adapter. Was unable to use. Did not mention this in the product description! 
6190 Nice well made case. The one I had tore after two uses. This one is made of more durable material and has more space for extra batteries and cables. 
6191 Hard to set up for recording, I return and switch to some other brand that can record! 
6192 Top quality portable backdrop for shooting portraits. 
6193 I ve got a G5, running 5.0 and with CameraFi it works fine. There are other setup out there I m sure, however, this one is working for me. 
6194 Great lens, I love it. I second all the positive things being said already. 
6195 Great product for the price 
6196 Not easy to assemble. 
6197 great product 
6198 The picture of this charger shows it as a dual charger for charging 2 batteries at once. I ordered 2 since I have 6 batteries I keep charged for my professional photography business. I was sent two standard plug in chargers. This is false advertising! Buyer Beware!! 
6199 Great kit to go along with the go pro. You get so many pieces for a great price. Glad Amazon recommended that I bundle! Husband has had lots of fun using all these accessories with his go pro! 
6200 If you try to figure out how to work this thing-good luck! Whoever translated the instructions from the Chinese obviously forgot to learn English! It s indecipherable goobledygoop. 
6201 Excelente 
6202 This is a great set of photo or video lights for a great price. It has greatly improved our picture quality. 
6203 Love this product! Extends the recording time of a 3/3+ camera almost by 4, making them a lot more usable. 
6204 An excellent product. Operates exactly as described. I appreciate greatly. YES I WOULD RECOMMEND this product to friends and colleagues. 
6205 Excellent. Works great. Got at least eight hours out of it. 
6206 I love my JVC Camcorder let s me record my favorite shows! 
6207 I love this camera and bundle! 
6208 Worked very well and received in a timely fashion. 
6209 So happy to get a replacement battery charger for our camera since ours was lost on vacation. 
6210 It did what it was supposed to do. Sadly it came off very easily. Eventually it was lost and never seen again. 
6211 Purchased as a spare battery. Battery is compact and has a good mAh rating. Both this battery and the orginal take 3.5 hours to recharge inside the camera compartment. Nikon should have bundled MH-65 with the camera instead of this cumbersome USB charger. 
6212 I didn t want to lug around a big hefty camera bag. This one is perfect size for my Sony RX10. And there is plenty of storage room for some lens cloths, extra SD cards, lens brush and more. I also like the solid quality of the bag. 
6213 works great. love that it has a strap so you won t lose it 
6214 This was a perfect upgrade for me! Thank you! 
6215 Replacement for a camera that stopped working after 4 years in Las Vegas outdoors. 
6216 Good camera. It has worked well after my lady figured out the many functions. Stars were withheld because no product manual was provided with camera. The online manual effort was completely frustrating. 
6217 Powerful flash 
6218 Outstanding!!! Best Tripod ever! Tried many, this one is beyond any of them, 5 stars SOLID, 
6219 Excellent for ultra compact cameras! 
6220 It is a nice lens filter, comes in a nice case. 
6221 Great for the money. Somewhat easy to setup and customize. You MUST have a PC monitor initially to setup & run this system. However once setup you can view and record from your mobile or from a secondary program on laptop. 
6222 Very handy to use and read the information I need to. 
6223 vgreat 
6224 It fit my 18-55mm lens 
6225 They don t last as long as the actual GoPro battery, but these are cheap and useful. 
6226 Perfect 
6227 Battery life is marginal. Was hoping for much better. 
6228 Exactly what I needed - works exceptionally well. 
6229 Love It ! 
6230 I like it 
6231 I anticipate that when I make it operation, this camera will fully meet my security needs Just installed with excellent help from Walter 
6232 Fits perfectly, made by nikon, not much more to say. Does it s job protecting the rear. 
6233 Broke less than 2 fays after receiving this product. Not happy with this service at all. 
6234 I am just learning to use a DSLR, but this seems to be a great choice with the ability to go fully automatic, but also various manual settings as well. Very light weight and compact for a DSLR.I am pleased with it so far. 
6235 The bundle did not come with the camera wall mount like shown in the picture and also in the description. Contacted company and the response I received back was that the bundle did not come with any additional lenses (I was not asking for a lense). 
6236 return 
6237 Worst instructions ever seen. Can t understand how to set time or clear value memory. Maybe the instructions are for a different model. 
6238 Like this camera, bought it used on Amazon. Only problem I ve encountered is occasionally it will take two pictures in a row when I push down button to take a picture 
6239 I love this lens. The quality of the photos is excellent with beautiful clarity. The wide angle works great for places with a wide field of view such as the New York City skyline. I am amazed at some of the photos I have gotten with this lens. 
6240 Good product. 
6241 works great, good price versus factory batteries 
6242 This has improved the quality of my photographs and YouTube videos. 
6243 This is an awesome camera. Just about the closest you can get to a digital SLR without the size and weight. The ability to connect via wireless to my phone is an added bonus. 
6244 Seems like good quality! Very handy to have 
6245 Works well. Wish the trigger was integrated. I fixed that by slipping it through the tether. Got it on sale for $1.00 with free Prime Shipping so it is hard to complain. My son has enjoyed it. 
6246 Great purchasing experience 
6247 Those guys who have stabilizer must Buy ITem 
6248 So far, a solid product. It s small, portable and gets the job done. 
6249 What can I say Teenager! 
6250 Worked fine for a day. I originally purchased this for a trip out of the country. The day I was leaving I tested the camera and it wouldn t work. Ended up having to buy another camera last minute. Not happy with this purchase at all. 
6251 Exelent purchase, no more head pain. Light, and nice price 
6252 Great case but I wish it had a place for my steadyGrip. 
6253 Just like the original from Canon 
6254 Love the color, and this camera is a lot of fun for my friends and me. 
6255 Good 
6256 Works well. 
6257 Great case with plenty of padding and compartments. It is a little bit larger than I expected. This case is a little better suited for cameras bigger than mine. I still like the case though! 
6258 I was very happy at first. I installed the battery and everything seemed great until I tried to charge it. Thats when i figured out I got ripped off. Very disappointed. I have a new battery that I can t charge. 
6259 Good quality 
6260 Rapid shipment 
6261 Great rate 
6262 Very useful bag. Lots of compartments. 
6263 Should have some more views and 2-3 days to check event on the free version. I miss different user permissions, just to allow them to disconnect the alarm when they are close to the device or make it able by time. 
6264 It was as described and worked perfectly charging my batteries. All parts were included and shipped promptly. 
6265 great product. Fits the screen! 
6266 Took this to Alaska and got some amazing whale and grizzly bear shots! 
6267 works great!!!! 
6268 Excellent product! Met my expectations 
6269 Took this into the pacific ocean and not a single drop touched my camera! It also fits Nikon Coolpix L30 
6270 Sometimes it goes off for no reason at all and other times it doesn t go off at all. 
6271 My husband bought this camera to replace on that just gave up the ghost! It takes movies and wonderful photos! 
6272 Great price point. Meets expectations. Incredibly easy to use and save pictures and videos. 
6273 Nice 
6274 Don t bother getting this. It arrived already broken and felt fragile anyway. Not worth the money if it even did work. 
6275 great product 
6276 As good as a cheap lens cap gets. 
6277 Daugher loved the gift, but it did not work. The return process was VERY easy, would buy from seller again! Thanks! 
6278 Good addition 
6279 The camera takes very sharp pictures. It is very easy to use. It fits very nicely in my hand, The only con is that the flash seems a little slow 
6280 Packaged neatly & works great! 
6281 Doesn t take good pictures when it s sunny outside, kinda a waste of a money in my opinion 
6282 Fits a little snug on my XE-2 
6283 While this is a terrific idea, the adhesive gave way by the second time I took the lens cap off. I am keeping them to see if I can find another way to make it stick. Other than that they are easy to &#34;install&#34; and they arrived quickly. 
6284 do not seam to hold a charge as long as original canon batteries. 
6285 Works great 
6286 Reasonable price for a rare product. 
6287 Great product delivered as advertised. 
6288 Works Great!!! 
6289 Great buy. No one even notices it. Video clarity is outstanding. 
6290 Love this product. 
6291 Purchased it thinking to record while walking around but the videos are just too shacky to be watched. A stabilizer is the best options. 
6292 Really nice kit. Happy happy with it. 
6293 Good Product Works as expected 
6294 The piece attached to lens cap separated. Almost lost my lens cap. 
6295 so so~ 
6296 Perfect little stand. I use it for long exposure shots on my Galaxy Camera which come out great. I can also use it for the auto timer feature. 
6297 Did not work on my pc. Instructions are confusing therefore will be returning the product. 
6298 Great Product Fast Delivery!! 
6299 The product was exactly as promised and works great, thanks! 
6300 Relive the joy of toys, without the hassle of aerodynamics, with this brilliant piece of work 
6301 Great device. 
6302 Very happy with this camera! 
6303 works good 
6304 Thank you for your persistance and finding the right part 
6305 AWESOME 
6306 Good quality, A little pricey but as an original accesory you get what you pay for. 
6307 I REALLY liked it. I used the album to create a scrapbook for a recent cruise. Perfect! 
6308 Fit perfectly into a case I already owned. Foam customized to my needs without any problems at all. 
6309 great 
6310 Nice product a little bigger than I would have liked 
6311 I consider it false or disingenuous advertisement to advertise a wireless system, especially for DIYers, that doesn t include the essential wireless component, the Wifi Module communicator that enables the system to &#34;communicate wirelessly! &#34; It s another charge for the Wifi module communicator. 
6312 This bag rip the third day I use it. The material isn t hat good. I recommend buying a professional one and not this cheap one! i have a canon t5i with an extended battery pack. 
6313 Good stuff! 
6314 Bought it for a friend and the feedback was more than amazing! 
6315 good 
6316 Good 
6317 Camera works great after dealing with D-Link agent (AR004636) 
6318 Case ID C6719807. Hazel was fantastic. 
6319 Not very good. The metal port got stuck in my laptop port second time I used it. Video isn t bad. It s just made like crap. 
6320 Love my gadgets thanks 
6321 Best camera strap ever!!!! 
6322 Awesome camera! takes amazing photos and video! 
6323 I bought this looking for a durable tripod for my ipod and this wasn t a very good product. The legs get very thin at the bottom and it is cheap and unstable. I would advise to spend a little more money to buy a better one. 
6324 comfortable, simple, useful 
6325 Dlivery was fast, and the product works 100% as expected. 
6326 Good quality for an upgrade from the nifty fifty which I also own...Better glass (to me) and love the stm system especially on my 70D. 
6327 Great product. Voltage and percent charges displays very helpful. Fast delivery and great customer service 
6328 Generally works great, but sometimes, without cause, the camera goes out and requires that it be unplugged, wait 10 or more seconds, and replugged. 
6329 The hook came off within few days of use. 
6330 Very pleased with these. The light with a speedlight wad great. 
6331 Product showed up dead on arrival wouldn t power on, tried to return with no luck 
6332 not as good as expected, case is large enough for intended use with GoPro and accessories; however, the zipper malfunctioned on initial use. no wont open without having to hold the zipper in place so not to further tear. very disappointing... 
6333 Came in handy. When my other battery died. I like to have this handy when i m with the kids on the road. 
6334 Item as described! Works great! 
6335 Works great with my Olympus E-M! and FL600 flash system. 
6336 good stuff 
6337 This product is great love it it is really better than a gopro compared to the price I am in love with it I use it all the time just some of my parts fall apart but is is still great 
6338 Great battery performance, great purchase value, love the external battery charger. 
6339 Good product. Fast shipping. 
6340 some of the balls keep coming off. 
6341 this was great better batteries than what came with the camera so happy with this 
6342 Cheesy but works and at low price. Works for the few times a year for crowd control or people mover. 
6343 Love this lens. 
6344 READ ALL THE ONE STAR COMMENTS. THEY ARE ALL TRUE. THIS CAMERA IS NOW BEING SOLD FOR A FRACTION OF THE ORIGINAL COST BECAUSE IT WILL NOT WORK AFTER A FEW DAYS OR WEEKS. SAVE YOUR MONEY DONT BUY EVEN FOR $5. 
6345 defective on surface, make unusable for professional use, as metal scuff, or little dents or cracks make base bump. Try another model type that couldn t get easily damaged......well China low quality products and poor model design some times make things bad. 
6346 Cheaply made...The shaft broke after one us...... 
6347 Got these two batteries really quick and they work really well for the came I would buy them again 
6348 I bought this charger for my daughter s sony camera and the first one they shipped didn t work, I contacted them and they quickly shipped me a new one and it works perfectly!! Very satisfied and good customer service 
6349 Makes DJI phantom professional very unstable... 
6350 Charges holds change and works in my camera. 
6351 Much more padding than expected. Great bag. 
6352 Perfect just as described, great price! 
6353 this case is really too small for the Sony Cyber shot for which I bought it. :o( 
6354 I feel like is to plastic, but it does its job which is what you want, correct? 
6355 grandaughter loves the camera, especially the double exposure........... 
6356 A good versatile lens but not as sharp as I hoped in the 150-250 mm range. Still a good travel lens. 
6357 The thumbscrew was missing for the gopro stand and the thumbscrews that originally came with my gopro hero3+ weren t compatible for some reason- which is too bad. It s really light and would have been great for backpacking trips. 
6358 Excelente 
6359 This bag is conveniently sized, well-constructed and has ample space for for my wife s Nikon Coolpix P600 while providing some space for small accessories, etc. and most importantly protection for the camera. 
6360 Goes through batteries pretty quick 
6361 Purchased for my Canon G-15, fit perfectly and worked great on my vacation. 
6362 Good quality I m glad I bought it and for the price you can t beat it 
6363 The camera works great 
6364 C6722013 TECH ID AR004273 Henry was very helpful and patient. His English was not the very best but it was a fun venture and I like the product as well:) 
6365 This was a purchase for myself and I have found it as advertised and a good purchase. The seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with. 
6366 it works well 
6367 This product is built using low quality plastic. The maximum syn speed is only 1/160s. If you are looking for a higher syn speed like me, you will be very disappointed. 
6368 good product seems to work for now will recommend to friends 
6369 I m using it mostly for checking out the cool, binocular-viewable bits of the universe, but of course they re usable for anything. Price is great, quality is great, I d recommend them to whoever. 
6370 Great video from a easy to use camera! 
6371 Bag is small size, and zipper fell so tight, hard to pull, return and take so long for process a refund. I m totally not happy with this seller.... 
6372 I really like this case! I didn t need a huge one just enough for my everyday uses. It holds my camera and my extra lens along with some misc stuff. but it was exactly what I wa looking for! 
6373 Sensors works very good. Amazed by the effectiveness. 
6374 plenty of room for my stuff except for the extended stick but other than fits everything else! 
6375 very nice. 
6376 Great night black and white picture. Great color in daylight. 
6377 great price for a nice camera and kit 
6378 Perfect replacement eye piece for my Nikon! 
6379 very high quality and easy to use micro tripod. I am using it for Olympus Micro four thirds camera. Both for PM2 and OMD EM10. easy to use and carry. I always carry it attached to camera 
6380 Works great! 
6381 Very good. Better than expected. 
6382 Works well, so far. Why pay more? 
6383 Does not attach or fit properly. 
6384 glad to find film for special project. 
6385 Good scope for bird watching and the like. My Kids love playing with it and learning how to focus and find stuff in the wild. Does what it says- a spotting scope. 
6386 fits perfect. So far no issues 
6387 spent a few hours this past weekend trying to balance it - fail. bought the roxant pro instead - balanced in minutes. 
6388 Just as described. Fast delivery. Large. Great for portraits. 
6389 It did not work at all. Do not buy. 
6390 love it 
6391 Great camera case for a great price. It is well made and sturdy and fits a small point and shoot camera. The camera I bought it for was just a bit too large, but otherwise the case is great. 
6392 the clip is good. The headstrap is good but after awhile i cut it off and diy on a hat( it will look way better ) and i think you can buy a aftermarket bundle. It cheap and will funtion the same. 
6393 super cool strap 
6394 This is a fantastic camera and worth the extra money. The quality of the pictures is amazing! I bought a factory refurbished one and have had no issues with it. It has performed flawlessly. You will be very happy with this camera. 
6395 great 
6396 It shows in my 18-55 at the lower range focal lengths and the threading is weak. Dont get it for short lenses. 
6397 Best head strap ever! 
6398 The product didn t work and I contacted Foscam two times and they have not responded to me. 
6399 They didn t have the size I needed so It was a waste. But the product seems to be good. 
6400 This did the job for my SJ4000. After a while, the center piece to mount it started breaking, but it still works well. I use it often. 
6401 OK 
6402 I love this charger, really fast. The only thing I don t like is 100% is not really 100% on the battery, it s more like 87 to 93%. 
6403 I haven t used it yet but it looks and stands great! Assembling it was a piece of cake! I just bought this for my daughters first!! 
6404 Its very good! 
6405 Love this bag 
6406 Love it 
6407 Lens does all that it is supposed to, but some of your customized settings (aperture) have limits compared to a Nikon lens. 
6408 Makes your gear look pro, and I wouldn t part with it for anything! 
6409 Excellent 
6410 Great product. Works flawlessly in daylight and at night. 
6411 No complaints here works like the original ones. Love the dual charger too 
6412 Great lens. 
6413 Its so dificult instol softweare. I m sorry but I returned back. 
6414 Working great! Using this with a Nikon D70 and have had no issues so far. 
6415 Great product 
6416 Good product at a reasonable price. 
6417 Item worked just as expected and arrived very quickly! 
6418 Had this battery for about 6 months now. Worked for 2 or 3 charges, now no longer accepts a charge, so its pretty much useless already. 
6419 Look real and self adhesive. 
6420 ONE OF THE BEST PURCHASES I VE MADE YET 
6421 Works quickly and the batteries last as well as the Canon brand. 
6422 Great product! The only downside is the polaroid picture is the size of a credit card, which is small and not the normal size of polaroid. 
6423 Quality not so good 
6424 Great little item...just what I wanted...and great service as well. 
6425 It s convenient that it folds up, but it s a bit wonky trying to get it closed up. Takes some practice. 
6426 Very easy to use. I love it. It adds the prefect flash. Very compatible with the Canon Rebel. It is easy on batteries and allows for modification right on the lens. Super quick to change the settings and I appreciate that. 
6427 We have a Sony Alpha SLR camera, these fit perfectly! 
6428 I have two other LUMIX cameras with the string attached caps. This cap is so much more appropriate for shooting. It performs as promised and looks great. I cannot understand why it was no included in the kit. 
6429 Beautiful and well made 
6430 Not expensive and it works 
6431 thanks 
6432 Originally I purchased the Neweer brand but it s too big and doesn t fit in left side. I found this Morros and it s perfect fit for my DLSR Canon 6D. You can install either left or right and fits perfectly. 
6433 Now I need 4 more :) 
6434 Great minimal bag for sure, (it s smaller than it looks online) but my new Sony a7r mark ii just barely doesn t fit with the Zeiss 1.8 55mm lens attached. Go bigger to the &#34;plus&#34; version of this bag, I think it s the 625. 
6435 thank you 
6436 Everything ok until Now ! 
6437 I had to return because the cameras are not compatible with windows 8 
6438 I used this lens paired with t3i and it did a wonderful job! Got it for a family visit from out of the country. We went to see so many sights and 35 mm was perfect! 
6439 Great little camera. Easy to setup the app works very very well 
6440 It works 
6441 It is the same old simple light behind the film viewer that does its job simply and well. That is what I had 50 years ago. It worked well then and still does today. What more is there to say? 
6442 Seems fine; pictures still in camera, yet the video works great for streaming! 
6443 Great lens, I forgot that it weighs as much as my 70-200, only shorter, much slower 
6444 Well made I love them 
6445 This is such a fun camera. Totally took me back to my childhood. The pictures are great and having them right away was the best part. I wish the film role held more than 10 pics, but the novelty of it all made it worth it. 
6446 We love our camera and use it daily! 
6447 Works well but I have not put my go pro on high speed risky situations. 
6448 works just fine, but the batteries seem to have a short life 
6449 I really like the look and feel of this bag. Build quality is good - zippers, pockets, and handles/straps feel very solid. This bag is perfect for a small camera. Highly recommend. 
6450 I wish the slides moved out easier, but other than than it works great for what I need. 
6451 The lighting might be tough to dial in. I ve had a few that were too dark and one that was too light, but it s a super fun little camera. 
6452 It looks really cool, works too. 
6453 It works good. Looks like an original. 
6454 works great thanks 
6455 Fabulous! 
6456 Nice option this is the second set of these I have purchased the first set still works fine. I use them as single straps but it is nice to have an option if I ever need to strap them together. 
6457 Great filter Kits! Exactly as described .. quick, fast delivery! Would order again! 
6458 Awesome stick, very sturdy, I use it all the time and it is great! 
6459 Work good, easy to set up (installing your own hard drive). The quality of the video could be better and the user interface isn t the easiest to use but all in all it s ok. 
6460 -so much easier than binoculars- 
6461 Decent quality. Might only take one or two out with me. 
6462 Cheap protection. If you want to preserve resale value for your Canon equipment, this is an excellent option. 
6463 Fit nicely on my lens without intrusion. 
6464 Looks great! 
6465 received in good order; slightly better capacity than OEM battery with camera 
6466 The picture is nice and clear. I really like the thin frame because it makes the pictures look even bigger. 
6467 Still getting use to this. Wouldn t let me download app to my Iphone but takes great pics 
6468 Prompt Delivery & Intact package. I ordered this cable to use on Foscam camera, I ordered & it worked without any issue. 
6469 I bought one Setup Adapter Ring: 52mm - 58mm. It arrived on time. I haven t used it yet, but it looks fine. i m from Venezuela. Thanks. 
6470 works great 
6471 Worked good 
6472 Very powerful. If your camera is less than 10 meters away use something smaller. This will blind most short range applications 
6473 Very nice lense 
6474 It is very nice 
6475 must buy for go pro, hope the next one would have a more modern look. 
6476 Great price 
6477 good deal! 
6478 Everything I needed and wanted. Thanks! 
6479 Excellent Product, highly recommended!! 
6480 The quality of the product I received was sub par - the screws weren t properly fitted and the build quality is bad - The shoe mount on the bottom is loose. Unhappy with the product. 
6481 I was told by mistake that my home alarm system needed a new backup battery but that was not the case. Oh well, now I have a backup battery in case I need one. Bobby B 
6482 Amazing very well crafted feels extremely sturdy 
6483 Volume is a bit low but otherwise works well. 
6484 I purchased this Manfrotto 128RC Head for my Canon Vixia S20 video camera. Very smooth, and as a bonus, it comes with two extra QR mounts. Would buy again. 
6485 Perfect replacement for OEM batteries 
6486 My daughter loves it!!! 
6487 buen producto 
6488 VERY NICE 
6489 Good quality, very happy. 
6490 Fast shipping, the camera is very easy to use and comes with so many accessories, the video and pictures came out nice! definitely worth the money... 
6491 Did not come with any instructions on the parts. 
6492 I simply love it. 
6493 A little clumsy to use but overall works very good. I use this with gradient ND filters and it allows me to adjust it to the position I want. 
6494 lens is to small 
6495 Nice Kit 
6496 These are fun! I have gotten to take some pretty cool pics with them.. I am planning on using them for a wedding photo shoot ( which is what I bought them for) in the near future. 
6497 The only reason I don t give it five stars is that I ve only had it two days. It charged my four RED Bricks from 0 charge in about four hours. For the price It seems to be great. Great build quality. So fingers crossed that it will last... 
6498 Work great thanks for the quality 
6499 fair for the price 
6500 This was a gift for my dad. He loves it! It works great and is nice and small. He has a chest strap and a strap to go on his hat, both of which it works great with!! 
6501 Looks great in my family room - very unobtrusive. 
6502 This camera is amazing. Easy to set-up and easy to use with my I-phone. Great picture and I can receive updates on my phone if it sences activity in the room where the camera is. Love it!! 
6503 easy to use 
6504 Danny was very helpful and did an excellent job! camera is very good and functions well! 
6505 Single-handedly makes the EOS-M useful. 
6506 It was exactly what I was looking for..... 
6507 Very fast good deal 
6508 Great product for deterrent. 
6509 Exactly what I needed and got it early! 
6510 Perfect 
6511 Nice extra gopro batteries. The wrapping makes it a little tight to fit into the duel charger, but very very slight inconvenience that I am ok with. Little accessories was a bonus! +++ 
6512 The best paper trimmer! 
6513 Great product 
6514 Needed to upgrade Firmware !!! 
6515 It did not quite work for the eos as it completely covered the dial for focusing the viewfinder. Bummed. 
6516 Nice screen size good viewing angle and pic quality. 
6517 Received the flash as described and promptly! Works fine on my Nikon D3200. Great price and good quality. 
6518 Perfect for filming skateboarding. 
6519 nice & easy to use seems to stay on well. 
6520 Really a great beginners drone. Lots of fun, wish the batteries last longer 
6521 I used it for my Jamberry storage and I love it. The black background contrasts nicely with the nail shields. Now I just need my order to come in from Jamberry! 
6522 I love this camera. It works wonderfully. When mine died I was heartbroken. I m so glad I found this one. 
6523 I got quite a lot for my money, the chest piece is the most used and very very comfortable and steady taking great pics and video with my go Pro 3+ 
6524 does as advertised. difficult to find locally 
6525 honestly didn t really like it can t see what you re recording the instructions are hard to follow. it s nice and all but wouldn t buy it again 
6526 This camera is amazing I upgraded from the gopro and will never go back. The tube design works great with my helmet and weapons. It also makes a great low profile dash cam. 
6527 It is a very good camera. 
6528 It is as advertised. Fits my 18-200mm VR II and will snap in place reversed. It is the one piece version not like the cheaper ones that have to attach by a ring. Pay another $10 and be satisfied.[[ASIN:B000C0QGAQ Nikon HB-35 Lens Hood (Bayonet) for 18-200mm AF-S Lens]] 
6529 Great quality images and optics, was just too heavy for what I wanted to use it for. 
6530 Good so far. Good quality resolution. 
6531 very difficult to make sense of the instructions for playback. I used this for the birth of my Great Granddaughter so I don t want to return it because I don t want to lose the footage. 
6532 All good 
6533 Nice 
6534 Already used in 3 dives, works great. 
6535 Perfect for HDM Z1 CPAP Machine 
6536 Everything I expected. I m glad I received it very fast. The pieces are of good quality. Can t go wrong! 
6537 Bought this for my daughters Powershot. Great construction and extra pocket for battery charger 
6538 Great! It comes with User guide and in perfect status. 
6539 2 years later and it s totally dead, I can get about 5 pictures on a full charge. I kept it as a secondary battery and it got little use and then when I really needed it nothing. 
6540 Good cheap tripod and selfie stick, but the tripod is wobbly due to the small feet. 
6541 Have not bought any film in 15 years so my supply of these was eventually exhausted. Very handy for screws and various other small things. The tops take a bit of effort to get off and seem to be better made than the aging Kodak canisters. 
6542 Now I can go through old negatives and slides and make prints for my family. 
6543 There is no off switch 
6544 You must remove the battery to turn it off 
6545 Excellent product! Fast delivery! We can now talk to each other clearly and not shoit down the stairs! Thank you! 
6546 Light weight and small. Great for my trip. 
6547 The camera would not turn on. 
6548 Love it get here just in time to see the meteor shower that is tonight 
6549 very good 
6550 Great deal 
6551 Works well. Love the length and does not tangle 
6552 I knew what I wanted/needed, saw it, and now have it! 
6553 Fits like a glove and looks OEM. 
6554 Easy to use. Great detail 
6555 Ordered two cords... one was fine. The other did not work. I checked the system w a different cable and it worked fine. Just a bad cable. 
6556 The first Phottix had a great wired cord that lasted several years, Today no matter where I buy them including Phottix they fail after a couple times. 
6557 Great camera with plenty of options 
6558 Exactly what it s says it is. 
6559 it doesn t focus properly at all..total waste of money 
6560 Has all the screws needed for my Phantom 2. I had stripped s few and needed some replacements. This pack had them all. 
6561 Great product. Would definitely buy from this supplier again. 
6562 Smooth and flawless operation. Works great with my manfrotto tripod! 
6563 Does everything I asked for. Easy to setup. I use it every day. 
6564 cheap 
6565 Camera will not work right out of the box the pictures and videos are full of horizon lines .Well got my replacement and guess what it is worse then the first one it is a shame that such a good flying drone have a peace of junk camera 
6566 Great product! It is exactly like the expensive versions. It s crazy how that can be. 
6567 Fast delivery and received what was purchased 
6568 Waste of money, and will drain battery s fast. Not functional at all. 
6569 Not as stable as it looks but overall I am very happy with the purchase. Not bad for this Price. 
6570 poor quality. very cheap made you get what you pay for. 
6571 Well worth the money 
6572 Good. For my camera. 
6573 Sorry... but this is a piece of junk -- do not buy it -- I was stupid for not believing the reviews. 
6574 Quick shipment....item as described .....Thank You! 
6575 The Pentax X-5 digital camera fits nicely in here, on its side. The pouches are roomy enough for memory cards and batteries. The padding is ample and the camera feels well protected. Overall, a good value. 
6576 easier and cheaper than other brands with great quality 
6577 great seller - delivered as promised! 
6578 Very easy to add to my Hensel equipment. Works like a champ. 
6579 Awesome camera great accessories but the bag won t hold everything. 
6580 Got what I wanted 
6581 Perfect fit, integrated look, very secure grip! 
6582 The first set I purchase were nice but the 2nd set I got wasn t so nice... will add a picture of it to show what I mean 
6583 Junk!!! 
6584 Good price 
6585 My husband was able to fit his keys, iPhone 5 (inside an Otterbox defender case), and his full wallet in the case. It fit nicely under the bungee cords of his SUP. Everything stayed dry while paddle boarding. 
6586 works well and is handy to have 
6587 Great magnifier and light, the versatile magnetic base is a plus. 
6588 Works...thanks. 
6589 Great Product! 
6590 Worked great the first night we took it out to an outdoor location. 
6591 Very functional, light, and easy to position on my belt. 
6592 Epic!!! nice 
6593 Product arrived quickly and worked as advertised. 
6594 Very useable and works perfectly with my Canon Camcorder. 
6595 Cheapest find for Film. The more you buy at lie time the better the deal. 
6596 Works great and the price was certainly right. 
6597 Excellent item for my photography studio and at an excellent price. The instruction manual is also in color a rarity in this cost cutting world we live in now. 
6598 No good sound 
6599 Very stable even though I have no rc experience. In not saying it is easy to fly for me, but that s not the quads fault. Everything worked as is should, no issues with seller, shipping was fast, and I even bought a second quad for my spouse. 
6600 Nice camera 
6601 it was cheap and it allows me to use my camera 
6602 Fits my Nikon D300s 
6603 Seems to be Just as good at a way cheaper price... Perfect purchase for my super surfing videos 
6604 Love Them. 
6605 We have installed the security system, it will meet our need. The only disappointment is I thought the system did not require a land line, but it does. 
6606 Very helpful in teaching me all the tools that I have on my camera 
6607 Returned 
6608 These are great so far. Have used them numerous times and do not get any fog on my Go pro case - These are very inexpensive compared to the other brand 
6609 great transaction. Product as described 
6610 Awesome product 
6611 LOVE THIS THING!!! Only one drawback, it drains the battery quick. 
6612 Very good! Good design and price point. 
6613 Love it works great:-) 
6614 nice item 
6615 Great package, the right amount of needed accessories. It came on time, in great condition, and i am pleased with the quality. Highly recommend it. 
6616 For this price!!! Awesome! But it is not carbon fiber! It is aluminum but works great! 
6617 Best tripod on the market for the price! Does stuff even the Mephoto tripods don t do for half the price. 
6618 Meets my need for a high quality and affordable polarizer filter for my new Panasonic DMC-FZ200. 
6619 So disappointed in this camera. The picture quality is poor and operating it is difficult. 
6620 Genuine Battery. Initially I was after a Japan made one. However, long story short. This one works well, couldn t see a difference with my other Japan made one. Now a days all are made in China even the one one you get with the camera. 
6621 useless. I returned it 
6622 Great remote control &#34;Master&#34;, simple to use. 
6623 working very well, glad you could provide products 
6624 Loved them very professional 
6625 Very good!! 
6626 Product as described, fast shipping, very pleased! 
6627 Good idea to create this, but build quality is really bad. It cannot securely lock with the small plastic attachment. 
6628 Excellent product 
6629 Very happy with the products and how quick they got here. Used the batteries and chargers that day. 
6630 Pleased with the order..:) 
6631 I LIKE IT ! 
6632 These are awesome and I love that I can just screw them on to my other lenses. 
6633 Neat product that allows customizing the setting on Sigma lenses 
6634 Worth the money!!! Buy the protection plan if you buy the camera!!! 
6635 Easy, fast, good product. 
6636 Excellent filter. Goes on the lens easily, excellent fit. 
6637 Awesome...significantly better than the Polaroid duel charger. I love the USB charging port on the side. 
6638 Easy to carry in case and works great. 
6639 it is so easy and fast to release the stands. 
6640 Works great. compatible with my camera and useful on our long trip 
6641 Great for any camera. The legs of the tripod are very flexible and has a good grip. 
6642 Works good 
6643 Works as advertised. Great product and good buy! 
6644 worth the price 
6645 I really love all this set up. Thanks. Good timing for delivery. 
6646 Technical support agent AR004631 was extremely competent and very professional and helpful-Very patient. 
6647 Good 
6648 Great product and price. 
6649 Takes great photos and love the waterproof feature 
6650 My 6D would not fits because it is too bulky. Smaller cameras would. It does protect your gear. 
6651 not bad 
6652 It was pretty easy to set up. Pictures look great. It has some cool transitions and an option to display multiple pics in a collage format. I was looking for a frame that could be hung on wall and display pictures taken as portraits (vertically), versus landscape (horizontally). 
6653 I love this thing. works like a charm- allows for new trigger options on my Fuji 
6654 great lens. great photos 
6655 It s a good case, but I thought it would be much bigger. 
6656 Like the small size and the strap is really nice compared to the on hand strap following the camera 
6657 It was just as described and quick service. 
6658 I m using Ravelli stands for many years. It s well built stands for all video works I do- holding lights and mics. I m abusing it very hardly and it lasts for me exactly to years, then I buy again and I m very happy with Ravelli stands. 
6659 Amazing prime lens! 
6660 Burned out the first day of use with my 14 ft LED strip. My fault. I should have got one with higher ampere rating. 
6661 It doesn t work. The battery never charges and the light of charge doesn t work. The app doesn t exist!! Sad you sell a not working product 
6662 I use this on my Nikon D5200 and it works good. 
6663 Good 
6664 Exactly what I was looking for at a good price. 
6665 Second time purchasing this same setup. The batteries run great just like the original gopro batteries. I have an older set that s already a year old and they re still running like new. 
6666 It s nice and small and compatible and easy to make videos 
6667 The lens is great, but the tripod fell apart on my first trip and would recommend a new product be included in this package. Great price for everything though, but would ve just bought the lens outright if I could go back. 
6668 Emailed them for new parts and they replaced the whole unit. Very easy to work with! 
6669 Easy to setup and works great. Picture quality is not as great as I would ve hoped for. 
6670 My camera doesn t have a snug place to place it. I am using it because I couldn t wait for another but once I have enough money I will purchase a better one. 
6671 Awesome durability, just like genuine. 
6672 Great item. Work as described. 
6673 Love this case holds all my go pro acc for any trip and sleek and small case as big as a binder 
6674 These batteries are good and reasonably priced 
6675 I should have gotten one sooner! 
6676 Doesn t have enough storage and broke after only a few uses. 
6677 Looks bulky but enough room to store camera, charger and extra battery. 
6678 Very versatile. Very handy for traveling. Lots of features in a concise light camera. Great lens. 
6679 Fast shipping, nice product! 
6680 Easy to carry your camera. Anti slip (grip) is working well. 
6681 fits, no problems 
6682 It s not a good 
6683 box was opened returned it. 
6684 For not being a go pro. Takes great pics and video. I got it mostly fir video. Love it for the price 
6685 Send item back was to big 
6686 Excellent product as described, fast delivery times!!!! 
6687 great low/mid level camera , bought as a gift, they love it 
6688 Thanks 
6689 As advertised, works great 
6690 Seems simple to operate -clear picture. Really haven t used it much yet but always like the quality of Samsung 
6691 Great image quality with awesome zoom. Lots of features, maybe too many! Would recommend for someone wanting a DSLR (without all the bulk, lenses, cost, etc.) but more than a point-and-shoot. 
6692 Not to hard to install 
6693 Colourful and functional at the right price 
6694 This is an excellent alternative to more expensive action-cameras out there. Good video quality and very easy to use. Waterproof cover appear effective enough for light underwater use, still need to test it. 
6695 Worked really well on our trip and paddleboarding! 
6696 Point and shoot cameras are a must have for surveying and inspections when on the road and this has lasted a long time. 
6697 This is a perfect walk around lens for my Olympus OM-D 5 Mark ii. Can get a little iffy in low light but during the day it is absolutely amazing! 
6698 LOVE this camera and super cool --- you can use ALL of the go pro accessories with this as well! 
6699 works ok but not very loud i bought it to use inside as a &#34;help&#34; alarm but the chime is not loud enough to be heard will have to get something else 
6700 It charges faster than camera base. 
6701 I lo ve it 
6702 Awesome little camera really helpful and fun. 
6703 Great security camera. I love the tilt and pan and really like the talk and listen feature. 
6704 A++++++ 
6705 Really good adhesive. Feels super secure. 
6706 Perfect case for our little Canon powershot effective protection great value. 
6707 The best bag I ever had... 2 in 1... 
6708 I am the one that loses these lens caps on my camera so I cannot tell you how thrilled I am to have one that stays on! Not only is it so convenient but I won t lose it anymore! Awesome product that arrived in 2 days as guaranteed! 
6709 This was a purchase for myself and I have found it as advertised and a good purchase. The seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with. 
6710 Great camera easy to work 
6711 Worked wonderfully as usual! 
6712 waterproof case is good but the suction does not stick 
6713 only complaint is when the touch screen waterproof cover is on it will not unlock. Other then that its great 
6714 My 15 yo son used it on vacation this summer. The pieces survived horse back riding in the mountains, paddle boarding and kayaking in the river! 
6715 Dead on arrival. Not worth the print to advertise it. A peice of junk! 
6716 We had an old camera and needed the battery charger and this was perfect for my camera to gift this to my mom 
6717 Well made and easy to use product, well worth the money. 
6718 Great 50 mm lens! 
6719 This is a great lens, works great for details or portraits 
6720 On time and exactly what I expected. Excellent job and a magic fiber cloth came with it. 
6721 Amazing price. Excellent for Gopro. 
6722 Cable a little longer than expected. Otherwise, product is great. 
6723 Thanks 
6724 Very good quality and very cheap for a rig AND follow focus! It s a perfect size and very easy to use and versatile. It s relatively lightweight but I would suggest ordering a counterbalance as well in addition to it. Would recommend this to any videographer. 
6725 looks great on a utility belt, but didn t feel like batman. it receives many filters of varying sizes. decent construction and easy to get stuff in and out of. mounts securely. good thingy. 
6726 Works perfect and I don t even notice it doesn t have a nikon logo -why pay more? 
6727 Very good quality 
6728 great price and reliable. 
6729 Does its job! 
6730 Nice addition to my macro photography gear. 
6731 On a budget? Great! This works perfectly on my canon 6D and the panning is smooth. Height is great for a 6ft good. 
6732 Shipping was fast I received it earlier than expected and I m very happy with the camera and accessories! 
6733 Outrageously expensive for a camera for which you cannot buy good film - all film for this camera has been discontinued or is expired. 
6734 These do a great job clean my glasses and laptop 
6735 great price 
6736 A great great deal. I saved a lot of money on all these accessories. It came very quickly in time for my vacation. 
6737 5 stars for the cost and the fact that it works under water. Needs more mounting options, made it work on my pontoon boat ok, but not on speed boat. 
6738 Product arrived as expected 
6739 Perfect 
6740 Just used it on vacation. Works great. 
6741 Did not buy this item 
6742 Didn t expect that &#34;Anti-glare&#34; means frosted, I don t like that. And the little one for shoulder screen doesn t fit, it s a bit smaller than the screen. 
6743 Good system Beautiful night vision I say BUY 
6744 3 days past the 30 days return policy and stopped taking a charge! I would think that an expensive item like this would last more than 30 days guess not! Maybe thats why they only offer 30 days?!?!?!?! 
6745 I took this camera to the water park for some reason when it went off it was hard to get it back on I had to take it out of the case and take the battery other than that it took great video 
6746 could not get it to work 
6747 Item did not specify what it could (or could not ) fit. This does not fit a Nikon D60 so I had to return. 
6748 awesome! 
6749 Attached it to a 300mm Nikon and works well for my intended purpose (astro-photography, long distance canyonland shots. 
6750 It was everything it said it was. easy to install. no problems. 
6751 Your 55-200mm needs this! Doesnt fit reversed on my55-200mm dx vr. 
6752 Wasn t a perfect fit for my camera, and by that, I mean it was a little loose on the mount, but other than that, it is a really sturdy lens. Very soft picture at f3.5. The camera I am using is a Sony a57 
6753 Great Customer Service, Henry , Solved all my connection issues! Foscam excellent camera all features HD and all are included in this Camera. 
6754 Product as described, arrived in time 
6755 Junk - the screws don t fit through the slots as they show in the photos. Completely useless as shipped. 
6756 like it a lot 
6757 Sometimes, it s better to save. 
6758 Excellent charger. No issues so far. 
6759 I use this along with the Joto Universal Waterproof sack for my Samsung Note. Both work great on kayak trips. The bright color is easily visible in case I drop it in the river while shooting photos. I suggest always testing these things in your sink/tub first. 
6760 loveit 
6761 work great and very reasonably priced 
6762 So cute and awesome, loved it! 
6763 great case for the price and is made with quality material. 
6764 Everything you need to start out with your Instax obsession! This is definitely worth every penny. 
6765 Good 
6766 Wow!! This really worked and now I can see everything closely and clearly. Great low price!!!! 
6767 Sucks 
6768 Perfect for table top 3D scanner application with a small projector and camera. 
6769 Very incredible flash, in depth for the Nikon d 5500, decent quality piece of equipment for the price 
6770 SO awesome! Very nice. My only complaint is that my black pear receiver cuts off some of the information. Not sure if its the mini iOSD or my receiver. Still pleased though! 
6771 All of the Datacolor gear we ve tried works GREAT! 
6772 The charger seems to work but one of the batteries will not hold a charge any more. This happened after 2 months. I d spend your money on the samsung battery as a spare and not worry about a charger. You can charge the batteries using an external pack anyway. 
6773 Up graded my gear and camera and this bag holds it all and then some. Awesome bag. 
6774 Everything fine, useful as expected & good delivery service... 
6775 Wonderful camera, so happy 
6776 It s difficult to turn the camera off or on, or to change the camera card, without taking the camera down from its mounting position, unlike front-loading cameras. i would not buy another one. 
6777 Had to return mike because it was faulty, was unable to connect to it. I was going to use it as a baby monitor. I was too afraid to get another one. 
6778 Don t waste your money on Nikon or Canon speedlights. Go with these. They get the job done and match and go beyond quality of c and n. 
6779 Fits the Canon Sx170 camera perfectly. I would highly recommend this case. Good quality and camera protection. 
6780 This is absolutely the cutest little camera! It was exactly what I wanted: old school pictures in a modern little package! I absolutely love it! Everyone that has seen me with it wants one too! 
6781 Good 
6782 can not loop record and destroy 3 of my SD card 
6783 Just received my camera, turned it on and found I was looking through a very grainy viewfinder. Thought maybe I failed to remove a protective sheet, but nope. Been searching the web for answers with no luck. Disappointed! 
6784 Perfect fit, easy to use controls. Just be careful not to lose the focus gear! 
6785 Kenneth with foscam s support team remote connected into my computer and made the setup effortless. The camera s quality seems pretty good. 
6786 right angle viewer works on canon reflex camera..dont have to bend your head so much. 
6787 Broke first day! 
6788 great product. 
6789 Can I just set the cams up without DVR or an computer? Can I just drill them to the walls and turn them on? 
6790 great product so surprised that the batteries were charged when I received them. 
6791 Awesome 
6792 I love it but was at first concerned with the free floating aperture lever. Just seemed a bit chincy that it would bang around like that. Overall I m impressed. 
6793 😀 
6794 Great product for the price 
6795 Great Product for the Price 
6796 GOOD sturdy material in useful szes. 
6797 Sweet 
6798 Works great, easy set-up and great price. plan to buy another in the near future. Highly recommend. 
6799 Really like this product nice pictures under water my granddaughter loves to play with it And the playback looks good.would puy again 
6800 Tiny bag must be like 4x3x2 
6801 The batteries work better then the one the camera came with. 
6802 This is just what I needed. It was packed real good, here when you said. Thank You,. Have a nice day. 
6803 Perfect way to carry your camera equipment without the camera bag. 
6804 Its a good deal but the quality could be better, but then you get what you paid for! 
6805 Canon expensive. 
6806 awesome little camera. takes great pictures. i use it with the 30mm pancake lens, it makes the camera very portable. 
6807 I haven t used this yet, but have tried it with my binoculars and it fits fine. 
6808 Works great more distance and clearer 
6809 Cool little device but not for me. 
6810 A+ 
6811 Adequate cable length 
6812 great product for the price...light weight and easy to use 
6813 Very good. 
6814 This cable is five feet long so I can drape over back of desk and leave plugged into the back of PC. Will carry smaller two foot original cable in camera carry bag. 
6815 easy to use & diverse tools to use with gopro! 
6816 Repeat customer for this brand. The quality and price are great and so far no issues. 
6817 Really nice bag for my camera and photo supplies 
6818 If you can spend money and buy something better go for 
6819 The accessories are great, but the case could be larger or designed better. The case will comfortably hold your camera, a couple batteries, and few small accessories. You can jam everything in there but I wouldn t recommend it. 
6820 D-Link case C6724030 Technician ID AR004276 I was provided excellent help from this great customer service expert guided me though install and setup. Able to see the camera in desktop, tablet and IPhone. 
6821 Fulfilled my expectations 
6822 good 
6823 Excellent filter, nice and thin, fit well. 
6824 camera works well, but the video output requires proprietary editing software to publish 
6825 Excellent, robust and easy to use. Once stretched with clips there were no visible signs of crease in the first photo shoot we did after unpacking the sheet. It comes with a nice cloth case with pull-string tie. I am very happy with this background sheet. 
6826 Looks a little different from the one that came with my T3i, but it works just as well. 
6827 This case is too small for my camera, so I don t use it. The return shipping fee is almost the same as the price of the case, so I didn t bother to return it. It does look well-made, however. 
6828 bought to protect my lens from scratches. does the job. 
6829 it does not work for Samsung cameras - not for NX. The NX screen flips up and the hinges are on the upper side. Impossible to mount on those cameras 
6830 For the price, this is an awesome little tripod but it can easily tip over with larger cameras so be careful of that! I ve had a few incidents of my camera flopping over but thankfully wasn t damaged 
6831 I purchased this so I could recharge more batteries faster. Works great and a much better price than from Canon. 
6832 Can t go wrong with Tiffen 
6833 This flash is working very well with my Sony a6000. It s a huge step up from the built in flash. The package came with quite a few extras. However, I have really only used the flash so far. Great for the price. 
6834 Ordered same day but did not make the delivery on time... Now I m out of film for my vacation. Nothing against the product. Love my Fujifilm..lesson learned from ordering last minute.....BUT IT SAID SAME DAY!! 
6835 It is a Pelican case what is there not to like about it! 
6836 The price was definitely right for this. It helps while taking photographs in bright sunlight, allowing me to have a bit longer exposure and capture vivid landscapes better than previously. The glass is fairly good quality, I will probably buy a stronger one (0.9, etc) in the future! 
6837 My first nice camera and I m very happy with it. I can definitely see the difference in the pics from using a cell phone camera. 
6838 It is what it is 
6839 Took it to the beach in FL. Sand, salt water ... no problem. Next year it s underwater pictures in Belize ! 
6840 GREAT 
6841 Great purchase, especially for the price. I wasn t sure what to expect, but works perfect for watching our pets and home while away. 
6842 I have issues with the zoom sticking. I have had it in the repair shop three times. I am not sure if anything will fix it. 
6843 Pelican = great stuff 
6844 Camera takes great pictures. Good weight. Camera needs better gripping to hold the camera. I think the flash should be located in the middle of the camera not at the end. If holding the top of the camera and the flash pops up, my finger is in the way. 
6845 Great product. 
6846 Great item, with this adaptor I can now use all my GoPro mounts with my new JVC Adixxion Camera 
6847 Fits my camera perfectly. good quality! 
6848 Works great! 
6849 As Promised and on time! 
6850 Only connects to their smartphone app, so very limited functionality 
6851 great 
6852 Product was exactly as described and at a great price and very fast delivery !!! Will be back to this sellers page !!! 
6853 Small and works perfect. Very happy with this product. 
6854 these are rough, they do the job protecting the stuff but dont think you can use them as lens cleaners too like a real goggle bag does. if they made a 5 pack of smith goggle bags or oakley goggle bags that is what most people are looking for !!!! 
6855 Really upset that I only got 6 prints out of each pack when it claimed to have 10 prints per pack! 
6856 Love it! 
6857 Bought it for our vacation at he beach. Loved it, takes great pics, loved having screens on both sides. Was able to get shots while playing around in the water without worrying about ruining the camera. 
6858 My hope was to use this as a baby monitor however the picture and sound won t stay up on any of my apple devices so it is not a good solution for a baby monitor. 
6859 At first I thought these were oem go pro batteries, but once I received them I realized they were not. Still a great deal and comparable battery for less than half the price of oem! 
6860 Strap a little thin but it works well 
6861 Great lasts forever 
6862 ETA September 24 I received items August 22. Way earlier then expected! great item! 
6863 After setting up two out of three cameras, I was having trouble setting up my final camera. I contacted Randy (AR)004232) and he was able to help me through the set up process. I was very impressed with his knowledge and his ability to help me get the camera connected 
6864 AWESOME, works as intended. need to struggle a little to understand how it works though 
6865 according to expectations, very good article 
6866 Love this stand for my D40 Nikon 
6867 Item did not come in original Nikon box, as described. All other items are included as described 
6868 Easy to install and get up and running. Package was delivered the evening before I left on vacation. I quickly had it set up and viewable from my android phone and tablet for easy viewing from hundreds of miles away. Added security and peace of mind. 
6869 Good 
6870 I received a used filter with finger prints on it and multiple chips on the glass, they were needle size tips chips but none the less, I was under the impression that I was getting a new filter. Very disappointed, going to stick to buy my filter from B&H Photo 
6871 super nice, I used for my gopro 
6872 I m an experienced photographer. These are perfect for most situations - particularly street photography. 
6873 What s there to say? It s the product from the manufacturer and does everything it is supposed to. 
6874 Was much larger and clumsy to work with than anticipated. Seems to be well built, good quality. I ended up buying a selfie which my teen daughter has now taken ownership of. 
6875 i really love it thank you 
6876 It fits. Its plastic. It was $2 used. I will not spend $30 on a piece of plastic because it says Canon on it. This does the same thing, just without the expensive logo. 
6877 work nicely with the Mini Sony CamAction and the Shoei Helmet. I mount it on the lower left side of the helmet. 
6878 didn t fit but the people worked with me and got me the right one.. 
6879 It works fine 
6880 Great high res camera for an excellent price 
6881 Easy to set up. Easy to change settings. Great little camera. 
6882 works just as good as the OEM ones for a little cheaper. no problems encounter 
6883 A must have if taking your GoPro in water. Works!! 
6884 The best 
6885 Simply Awesome. Hope they will come up with a auto retractor 
6886 Great product. 
6887 What can I say? This OEM Canon battery is the gold standard. It is more expensive than aftermarket options but when you need guaranteed performance, this is the battery you want in your camera. It holds a charge when used or stored, and the camera software recognizes it. 
6888 Charger works great, charged both our OEM battery and the Kastar battery. And the Kastar battery appears to last as long as or close to as long as our original batter does, so that s great! Thank you Kastar! 
6889 Just buy it camera is amazing makes every pic look like a professional photo. 
6890 Works great for my camera 
6891 Great price! 
6892 Works exactly as it is described. Other reviewers stated it really has an intense rubber smell...they are correct and that is why I only gave it four stars. I will be cutting the rubber off. 
6893 Terrific for the price. 
6894 Works as expected 
6895 ok 
6896 I am so glad I purchased this, as a graphic designer and photographer I desperately wanted my monitor calibrated. It was easy to use and I was able to calibrate my monitors of two screens. Very happy with this purchase. 
6897 great deal and smooth transaction 
6898 Perfect 
6899 Everything in this works great and I love it! The video quality is also very good and I enjoy my kit a lot. Good price. 
6900 Good 
6901 Perfect for my needs 
6902 Fits my Canon 70D perfect. Nice and durable bag. Would recommend. 
6903 Works well and no glitches so far. 
6904 I love this camera. I bought this camera because my iPhone doesn t take good video in low light. The camera is amazing. I highly recommend it and it s worth every penny. The 1&#34; sensor makes this camera shine and stand out from all the rest. 
6905 Good cables 
6906 Not as pictured Missing bag Missing screw Missing filter 
6907 GW Security technical support was excellent. I had a small problem and GW responded in couple of days and rectified the issue. Thanks GW the camera is great. 
6908 Love this camera! ! 
6909 Nice 
6910 Works like a charm! Was finally able to clean my laptop screen with out it being left with streaks! 
6911 this case is great. the quad fits perfectly with enough space for plenty of batteries and accessories. the only thing is the space for the extra props fits 1 set of 4, maybe 6. 
6912 Just what I was looking for. Adjustable intensity of light and a rechargeable battery 
6913 Nowhere in the description (or product packaging) does it say that it is ONLY usable with the &#34;Swann&#34; brand receiver. Bought this as an add on to a different brand wireless system, it will not connect. 
6914 Great product. Used it on 9 dives our past trip! it is lightweight and very comfortable to wear. 
6915 works great, used in the ocean in california 
6916 Its like receiving a bag of goodies. The Case is good and accessories are decent, but for the suction cup holder I will stick with the GO Pro Brand. 
6917 works as advertised and doesnt leave a ring around your eye. 
6918 Great tripod. Versatile and super sturdy, even with a 500mm lens on my Sony a6000. 
6919 excellent product, works well and at a great price! Would recommend this product for any photographer in need of a neutral density set. 
6920 Do not buy this product, after days trying different things to make it work it will not detect the cameras, its not worth the headache, it does not work, buy something else. 
6921 I work at HD & use them to find product numbers on high storage items. Even with my glasses I can t read the high numbers. 
6922 I really like this lens hood. It stays out of the way, but works very well and can be reversed easily. It s a great buy! 
6923 Lasted a few hours with its first charge, which is fine. But with subswquent charges it only held its charge for about 30 minutes or less before dying. Sucky. 
6924 I was not able to use. Even though it was a replacement for Bf808u, the wall unit nor car charger was correct. 
6925 excellent filter! 
6926 Nicely made and neatly stitched. This is a handy way to hold two batteries. I am using mine for Panasonic batteries for the G3 camera. 
6927 I love the camera. It s so much better than any one I have ever had. Great deal. Thanks. 
6928 just what i wanted; good visibility and not too heavy to use without stand; 
6929 I took this camera to London, Paris, Istanbul, and Doha. It performed wonderfully. It does all of the basics well, and has some nice added features (like a pop up flash.) This is the best camera I ve ever owned in this price range. 
6930 does the job! 
6931 The camera lens case worked out and fit perfectly. Quality looked good and put together well. The purple band and purple fur interior helps to differentiate between cases. Very satisfied 
6932 Broke within minutes. Seller said the faulty part would be replaced, months later, nothing 
6933 You can t wear it, inside is the hat there s a hard plastic shell to keep the wiring from you head so the hat doesn t stay on your head. This was a waste of money for me not a good purchase. 
6934 I have had this camera for a few years and used it extensively in cold weather shots in Alaska. I like the viewfinder for people pictures or taking shots in too much direct sunlight. The movies are pretty amazing for something you can tuck in the shirt pocket. 
6935 OK for me! 
6936 Love it! Got one for my husband and my mother. Like the calendar feature that still plays the slide show in the smaller frame. Would definitely recommend - and size is just right for desk - anything bigger would take up too much space. 
6937 Recieved, everything ok. Excellent product. 
6938 Works as expected, this is the kind of charger Nikon should have included 
6939 Excellent quality for the price! Easy to use, durable and good quality. 
6940 So much nicer than my 3rd party grips. 
6941 Fits Olympus 17mm f/1.8. Works well as replacement for outer edge pinch cap which are difficult to remove or replace especially with a lens hood in place or on smaller diameter lenses. 
6942 So I guess I thought this would focus up close with this lens but it is literally just a mirror attached to a clear lens. Kinda not what I thought. Its a little dissapointing 
6943 Worked fine and at a MUCH lower price than the Cannon 
6944 Great for out budding &#34;scientist&#34;. Decent optics at the lower powers. 
6945 I ordered a purple camera and received a white one. I am very disappointed. If it weren t for the fact that returning items was such a hassle, I would return it. If it were possible to give zero stars, I would. 
6946 Nice plate to keep on camera without taking much room. 
6947 Low quality printing. I d go with another company/ design. 
6948 Didn t last long. Broke quickly. Dangit! 
6949 Use this every time I pull out my telescope 
6950 Great bag! Holds all my equipment and that s a lot!! So many pockets that I sometimes forget where things are. 
6951 Upgraded from the old style controller without the gimbal tilt wheel. This is the same controller as the factory controller that was shipped with my first DJI Phantom 2 Vision Plus, however this controller also has the rechargeable battery. For the price, it was well worth the added features. 
6952 Utilize this every job I ve had. Excellent quality and great price 
6953 Great Product, works as advertised with no issues with broken parts or dead batteries as some have reported. 
6954 Fits my new long lens perfectly and is well built. 
6955 The battery has worked excellently, and it was delivered very promptly. Having used it in our GoPro for several months, I can say that it has worked exactly how we wanted it to. I highly recommend getting it from SNOW_WAKE_SURF! 
6956 Built like a tank. Exceeded my expectations. 
6957 Very tight for my Galaxy 6 with the Otter Box case. 
6958 Easy to use. Recently used on a trip to Russia from U.S. 
6959 These are crap they fall apart wasted my money once again. I am a real paranormal Investigator I no what is crap 
6960 The tripod is so cheap I would never trust my camera on it. Other then that everything is great. I love the side hand grip, and have recommended it to anyone who will listen! Great product. 
6961 Great condition and cost effective way to give yourself secure piece of mind when away from home. 
6962 Although the camera said it was connected over wifi, once I disconnected the wifi cable it would not connect. I repeated for hours, restarting and rebooting every device. 
6963 Great for the price but not real good cameras at night 
6964 Great item! easily accessible and works great! 
6965 You pay for what you get. It has decent quality and video. Mine had a black dot right in the middle of the sun when it was in veiw. Don t let it take shock at all it ll screw it up bad. Mine no longer works properly. 
6966 Love how it s softens my flash. Used it for outdoor & indoor shoot. 
6967 This camera does not focus good at all, the color seems to be off some, Not true color. and the night vision was super grainy even with some light.. I have several cheaper Zosi cameras and they are much better quality then this one. 
6968 Saved my drone thanks so much 👏🏾👍🏽 
6969 Nice camera, weird user interface, takes some time to get used to, for the price its a nice camera 
6970 Easy to attach. Seems sturdy enough in construction. Given as a gift to a friend who is planning on using it for his hunt coming up. I m looking forward to the pictures. Company was prompt in delivery. Nice box with added accessories.thank you 
6971 I have always used the Hoya filters and love the slim frame design. 
6972 Comfort s quite disappointing. 
6973 Awesome lens. Delivered promptly and the item was as described. Thanks so much!!! 
6974 Works perfect, great price at Amazon. 
6975 Bought this mostly for the air ball. 
6976 They dont do anything, except the fisheye, but it s not even that great. 
6977 I have a Sony Cyber-shot. fit my camera exactly. 
6978 Not a DSLR but this is a great camera for family reunions just to save the memories. 
6979 Product was exactly as described and at a great price and very fast delivery !!! Will be back to this sellers page !!! 
6980 very happy now I can play with my camera, I recommend 
6981 The item is not worth the price paid. 
6982 I absolutely LOVE this lens. It is used all the time and looks phenomenal. I would immediately recommend this to anyone that asked! 
6983 The measures are good, and you can move it easy, the materials are well for the price. But the head make noise when you paning or tilt. And the legs loose the high easy. 
6984 excellent price, product as advertised, held charges well, highly recommend 
6985 It does the job 
6986 very good lens 
6987 This arrived as promised, with two functional batteries. Great item. 
6988 its good 
6989 compact, works great and is light. 
6990 excellent 
6991 Not very impressed with this tape. Looks great on the roll but doesn t stick to anything. I am not sure what this is for... tape that doesn t stick... 
6992 Won t stay on! 
6993 ... years ago, when I purchased this lens it was the only 300mm option for the GF1 I was using. That aside, I have used it to get some nice, exciting shots of birds that I otherwise would not have. I m very glad I purchased it. 
6994 Wonderful units! A must have. 
6995 Ok 
6996 Good bargain on these batteries. They are hard to find in stores and when I do find them I pay $5 for each one!! 
6997 Gotta love that pick n pluck foam ! I ll be ordering for my other cases. 
6998 Just started using the camera. Will take time to benefit from all the features. Happy so far. 
6999 great 
7000 Good light for the money, 
7001 A good battery and charger I purchased for the Panasonic ZS15 .Very good in all this great compact camera 
7002 Couldn t be happier! What a vendor! 
7003 I rate 3 star because the tightness adjust screw can t keep on my set. once its set on tight, and loose after few times rotate monopod. 
7004 Don t waste your money. Just buy more battery packs 
7005 I love the camera, but very dissatisfied with the battery life of each charge. My previous cannon had a different battery pack a lasted almost twice as long. 
7006 It works like few weeks now after few days It was not working. I am not sure its battery or remote control by it self. 
7007 I was able to fit an 808 hq30 camera. I have not tested it underwater yet. 
7008 good item. a little tight, so I didn t use it yet. 
7009 What a bargain~ 
7010 It give you the essential s to help anyone take better pictures. In as much if you purchased each item separately it would be pricey worth the price 
7011 There are no better cases than Pelican. Hands down. 
7012 Works great just as good as my Gitzo 6x but for 2/3 the price 
7013 Good for messenger bags; not good for typical backpacks. It s wider than expected, but of reasonable quality. 
7014 Install this great add on to system. Great picture 
7015 sets itself up easily. sound works on an ipad with the app. for it. 
7016 one of a few places where can purchase a great purchase 
7017 I really like my Nikon Coolpix camera. Easy to use and light weight. Works great. Love that it s pink! 
7018 Bought this camera for my daughter prior to our trip to Maui this summer and it took some fantastic pictures of our underwater snorkeling trip. 
7019 Works great 
7020 I had to return this item. The built is good, it s also bright but the green spike is a little too much. 
7021 The batteries work just like the original batteries I got with the camera, so far I have about 10 recharges and no complains. 
7022 Great camera. 
7023 Excellent product 
7024 Perfect!!! 
7025 A good buy, Happy costumer. 
7026 Satisfied 
7027 look no further! There are no exceptions for this product! 
7028 Great cameras for the $. We can see everything. Clarity is awesome too. No blurry spots. 
7029 easy to install 
7030 Held up in some intense class 3 whitewater on an upside down kayak... Got some cool footage! 
7031 Exact fit. 
7032 Good 
7033 Best, top of the line camera. Love the quiet shutter, its heavier than most, but takes remarkable images!!! I ll never own another camera. 
7034 Useless. Faulty design. Returned it. 
7035 I ve not used any of them yet. Ordered them for a party. They are cute though. 
7036 I bought this as a gift for a family member and they love it. States it is much better than the regular neck strap which gets tiring after a few hours 
7037 Nice, portable. I use it with my iPhone 
7038 good 
7039 Awesome lens. Bright and sharp photos. Loving it so far. 
7040 Good 
7041 Works very well and consistent after you learn to use it. 
7042 Cool!@ 
7043 my only grip of the 7000 series is the small body size compared to my D200. This really made a big differece. 
7044 5 stars because you can t beat the value for price. It comes with a memory card and I filmed a time lapse first chance I got and loved the results. Using the wifi mode a huge plus. 
7045 Good product; well designed. My Phantom 2 Vision seems to fly much better with these props than with other brands. 
7046 Awesome product. Works well with waterproof cover in the ocean, on my motorcycle, sports events 
7047 I have to say this is super easy installation camera that I highly recommend to any mothers who need to watch their babies. Although it is VGA resolution , it provides me good image quality that I expected. 
7048 Battery was well priced and delivered on time. However the camcorder it was going to be installed into no longer works. Never used this product. Thanks anyway Amazon 
7049 Easy on and off for storing in the bag and protects the edges of the lens nicely. 
7050 It doesn t work! I opened it and the screen won t turn on 
7051 Everything was as expected. Product and timely receipt were perfect. 
7052 The AmazonBasics Tripod is sturdy and secure. A good choice if looking for a tripod with a GREAT price. Love the hook to hang additional lens on!!! 
7053 Takes great close up pics. 
7054 Excelente 
7055 Worked grest 
7056 Extremely practic. Nice 
7057 Great Product!!! fast Shipping!! 
7058 Very happy with the camera. Its a must to turn it off or the battery will drain. 
7059 Product was as advertised. 
7060 I didn t really want to add a surveillance device to my security system, but opted for one camera along with motion detectors and sirens. The resolution of this camera is very good but it would warrant five stars if it had a zoom feature and smoother action. 
7061 Excellent service! Product as described! 
7062 Looked like it was gonna work great. Then an oring broke before first use. Total garbage. 
7063 I love this product!!!! 
7064 Works as expected... It s definitely an affordable option when considering an action camera. Only down side so far is that the screen is a little flimsy. 
7065 Perfect mount for my Olympus Camera 
7066 Easy to use; Effective and used for a successful installation. Good price 
7067 Well made and fits my nex nicely. 
7068 as described 
7069 Great battery life. Works great, fits great. 
7070 Nice!!! 
7071 They are batteries. They fit in my mouse. What else can you say about batteries? 
7072 My camera fell off in mid air and smashed to the ground. 
7073 Seems to drain quite quickly compared to batteries with similar MAH 
7074 Product is exactly as advertised. 
7075 Good 
7076 Love em. Perfect for pranking however when outdoors and windy they audio can be out of sync with the video to see them in use check out my YouTube channel @ psycokid4ever88 and watch my pranks 
7077 Good but i think this have remot for com 
7078 Eighty bucks well spent, love this thing, don t know why it took me so long to get away from stupid neck straps. With the Arcatech swift clamp it was a bit pricy, but well worth it. And you won t look like a tourist when using it lol. 
7079 Holds 2 Paul C Buff Einstein lights, extension cords, light stands, umbrellas, triggers, and various other items. Now all I have to do is grab one bag and all my gear is in there. 
7080 really works for me, especially on the streets of europe. wished it was less expensive though. the rain cover at the base really works. the padding which comes in contact with your back though will suffocate & make your back sweaty 
7081 This is small enough that I can take it anywhere in my camera bag. I love how adjustable the legs are. This was not an expensive tripod, but it s actually pretty sturdy and really comes in handy! 
7082 Exactly what I needed! 
7083 Difficult to operate. The toggle area is very small and hard to manipulate. Wouldn t buy again. 
7084 I love it take nice clear picture and you can zoom in and all so fits in your pocket. its great!!! 
7085 Super! 
7086 Works great, however sometimes the onboard controls seem to take priority to the camera controls. When this happens it is quickly resolved by switching the on/off switch on the battery grip on/off. Definitely not a deal breaker for me, but would be nice if this didn t happen. 
7087 Thank you! 
7088 waterproof, dustproof and shockproof?the best camera in the history of human race. quite pricey but the quality of this device is really great. 
7089 was not all there len cap missing got 3 lens and the case hat all no len cover cap bad......[[ASIN:B003QQYFLA Bower VFK46C 5-Piece 46mm Digital Filter Kit]] 
7090 I wouldn t recommend. It definitely doesn t work for what I want. Limited focus. You truly get what you pay for. 
7091 Works great, got this for Canon G16 so I don t have to wear it around my neck, I can just slip it in my pocket. 
7092 I ve been using this camera for 5 weeks and am totally pleased. The seller shipped it fast and sold it at a good price, just as advertised. Most of my pictures are of wildlife, especially birds, and I highly recommend it among cameras in its class. 
7093 Very Good 
7094 This is just what I needed for my camera! 
7095 Thanks so mush I like it 
7096 Nice quality product. Excellent price! Delivered on time. 
7097 great 
7098 Worked just fine. Interesting video shot from unique perspective. Do you have enough ideas for video to make it worthwhile. 
7099 Works! 
7100 So far so good. I needed camera with zoom plus ability to make pictures while shooting video. It kinda on a slow side to start, has bunch of futures for young people, manual on short side but you can find it on computer. 
7101 The Canon EOS REbel T5i camera is an excellent addition to the field of photography...easy to use with professional results. 
7102 My six-year-old grandson seemed to like it! But, he did not provide a detailed report. 
7103 3 1/2 some pieces are hard to fit 
7104 I could not get it to work 10 days after receive it! 
7105 Very nice! 
7106 Been using this product so far so good. 
7107 This tripod is great!! Its very affordable and easy to set up!! I love the fact that I can use it to film with my iPhone 6!! 
7108 IT WAS THE WRONG CHARGER 
7109 I like it 
7110 works perfectly. 
7111 Does what it say. 
7112 hard to find additional quick release plate mounts :( all the plate mounts that do fit come from overseas and takes mount or more to arrive 
7113 Quality is cheap 
7114 Was very happy with this! 
7115 Easy to set up and operate. I operate from both the browser website and the Android app. Have set up in two different houses. Seems like good Wi-Fi range. Comes with nice, flat patch cable to hardwire into router for setup. 
7116 Fast shipping works well 
7117 Much sturdier than I expected. Holds flashes, umbrellas, video lights. Appreciate the ability to change angles of whatever is being held. Plan on ordering a few more. 
7118 Fast shipping. Vid is grainy at times but for the price it is very a very good cam. 
7119 Wonderful product for the price. I attached it to a 18mm lens and got some dramatic shots like the one attached to this review. Mind though, that they are a little heavy and bulky, so your zoom lens will look like a tele and weight as much. 
7120 Awesome package deal , everything was as described will do business again 
7121 It gets the job done, especially if you are on a budget. 
7122 love the zoom feature for a compact camera. 
7123 Doesn t hold a charge for longer than three weeks. 
7124 Very cool product! I have it on my camera, and it is nice to know that I will have plenty of juice for all of my shoots. 
7125 Bought 2 and both are coming apart at the seam. Good when they work, though... 
7126 Works as advertised 
7127 Awesome product, awesome pictures. 
7128 The best! 
7129 works good but under articulation you can crack the joints rendering it useless 
7130 It works good... 
7131 Works perfectly and love that it comes with extra batteries! 
7132 All good! 
7133 Works great, looks great. Battery life is decent. Can t see anything in the dark 
7134 Exactly what I was looking for 
7135 I have the older style: single position bulb for 60X and slide out 8X. The 8x is useless, but the 30X has very sharp magnification and the focus wheel is very helpful. An annoying aspect is that it has a backward reversed image. 
7136 rain proof it is working for my ip camera. 
7137 It does it job, rubber caps are ok, back and side doors quality feels low but you definitely get what you pay for. 
7138 Acceptable quality for the cost, but have reasonable expectations on visual quality. 
7139 Loved this and worked exactly like I needed it to. Simple and easy. 
7140 I received this camera on time; but when I looked at the package, it said to develop it by April 2010. It is at least 5 years out of date. I am returning it. 
7141 Loving it! If you re looking into buying one of these, you probably shouldn t be looking at Amazon review. Very complex. 
7142 working as advertized 
7143 Nice new camera. Very useful for taking pictures all around. Arrived on time. Thank you. 
7144 You can count on Lowepro to deliver quality products and I love this bag. It carries all my camera gear with ease and is not too bulky or heavy. I purchased the bag in the green color and have received compliments and &#34;where did you get that?&#34; questions. 
7145 Love it!!! 
7146 Recommended! 
7147 great 
7148 Very happy with this product - it s inexpensive and works great! 
7149 Excellent seller and product. A must have for anyone who shoots photos with a DSLR camera. 
7150 Came with the printer, paper works fine and prints fine. I wish there was a local source so I could get replacements quicker when I need them 
7151 works well and very affordable 
7152 Amazing! Does exactly what you need. Built like a tank and very sturdy. Must have for any serious photographer. 
7153 Very nice case. I cut out the foam to fit around my drone. Keeps it nice and secure 
7154 It did not work. I changed battery and it was still dead! Very cheap feel too. I cannot find any reliable looking remote control for the Nikon N1 VR3. 
7155 Th sound don´t fuction. 
7156 Perfect size for Panasonic Lumix. 
7157 Works as expected. Pretty long lasting, but mine is brand new, so we ll see how it goes. 
7158 Excellent accessory for the Go Pro. Allows hands free use. You won t worry about dropping during entry/exits on your dives. Go Pro cameras has now become the number one object divers find on the bottom, replacing knives and weights! 
7159 Great little camera for me. Easy to use and takes good pictures. 
7160 SUPER PRODUCTO 
7161 Worked as designed. Solid build. 
7162 I was really happy with these stickers. They came promptly and they were just as expected. I like all of the designs. 
7163 Love it! Works great and fast shipping! 
7164 This is the best bag for cables. 
7165 It s a wonderful camera with almost everything one need to learn the art of photography. I strongly recommend it. 
7166 Excellent Quality. Stylish mat black structure. This product exceeds my needs for my photography skill level. It is not the lightest one on the market, but works for me. 
7167 I love this as it is very light weight to carry, but with you camera on it, it is kind of unsafe...make sure you have your camera strap around your next just in case it tips over. 
7168 Handy and easy 
7169 I guess as long as you get a smatree pole you should be alright. Was hoping there was a kind of &#34;standard size&#34; pole. There isn t. It didn t fit my pole 
7170 Careful they dont sent you a 16.1 MP and pass it off as the 20.1 MP....after this happened I complained and got 10$ refunded and kept the camera. The camera is very nice for the $. Point and shoot. 
7171 best of the best 
7172 Do yourself a favor, if your looking for batteries and accessories for GoPro, buy original GoPro 
7173 I have been happy with the product for the last year. 
7174 Great product - Easy to use and protects camera from the elements. 
7175 It s amazing. Very easy to us. I can tell you, buy it! Thanks Neewer and Amazon! 
7176 Excellent 
7177 easy to use, sharp, clear vision through the lens 
7178 Takes very good pictures, easy to use, great zoom!!!! 
7179 Generic lens failure reported on google search. Returned. 
7180 Very good. 
7181 I am very unhappy with this product as we have been unable to connect it to the internet and numerous calls to the company s tech support have only resulted in frustration. It is a huge waste of money since it can t be set up. 
7182 Exactly what we needed 
7183 everything was ok. the camera is amazing and the kit is good too 
7184 This does NOT come with the mount, you will need to buy a mount that can fit your flash and also mounts to a bowens mount 
7185 Beautiful bag, enough room for my camera body and a couple of lenses. The padded insert comes out so I can use it for a handbag. 
7186 Great protector of your main lens and adds to clarity of photo. 
7187 Fits everything that I use for my GoPro Hero perfectly. Have had no problems with the case, very durable and compact. 
7188 Nice filter. Thin, light weight.haven t had it out on a shoot yet. Super fast shipping, well packaged. Thank you. 
7189 Fit for purpose. 
7190 And it works, well. 
7191 For the price you can t complain! They are nicely built and give you clear image even there magnification is so high! You need stable hands or tripod otherwise things look shaky because of 20x. Recommended for night viewing and wild life. 
7192 Good 
7193 It s great thanks 
7194 Looking forward to using this. The toting bag is nice. Quick to set up, light weight. 
7195 Arrived on time and a better value then purchasing locally. 
7196 Great Product! I will buy it again. 
7197 NO COMMENT 
7198 Just as described--and just what I needed--with perfect shipping! Thanks so much! 
7199 a nice improvement. 
7200 Really easy to use and has a great range. We actually have family pictures from our recent vacation with ALL of us in the photos! 
7201 Almost too bright. I had to pull it back farther from the window to make it look like our TV looks normally. Nice, random lights like the TV. 
7202 seems pretty durable and the hotshoe fits very sung... maybe even a little to snug but at least I know it won t fall out 
7203 Came in handy with my water camera. Best purchase!! 
7204 Love this lense. I currently use it with the a x1 
7205 I was able to photograph the moon with it and it came out very good. 
7206 great, just rec d and have not used. But have never had problem with other tapes before 
7207 Excellent! 
7208 Love the Polaroid Zip ... and the paper you have to get prints out dry. 
7209 Great product 
7210 This is a really fantastic camera! Go to DxOMark dot com and read more about it: they say the D810 is not really much of an improvement as far as picture quality and sharpness goes. The photos are fantastic. Read all the other reviews. 
7211 Perfect fit. I love it. 
7212 worked great 
7213 So far so good. Surprised they came fully charged and ready to go. 
7214 it go s 150 feet or 50 meter and more 
7215 The unit is sturdy--I am still playing around with different configurations 
7216 over priced 
7217 The binoculars had a very strong noxious odor from the rubberized coating. 
7218 No holes in side. I knew this might be the case based on other review, but for $15 I can drill some holes in it. Still cheaper then name brand gopro skeleton housing. 
7219 Photos show beautifully. Music does not work and instruction manual does not explain how to correct it. 
7220 Great price and quality of product. Thank you 
7221 The product doesn t like brand new as the inner filter box was quite dirty and there is a dent on filter can t be cleaned off. I am in oversea so can t return it, not a good experience this time 
7222 Great filter set with compact carrying pouch. 
7223 Works well. My teenage daughter is going to town. Easily pairs up with iPhone 5C, and appears to be well made. 
7224 Excellent transaction - no issues 
7225 It was broken when I opened the box! 
7226 Great bag, Roomie and would trust that it will withstand a fall. Was impressed by the color, durability of the pockets and it s organized design. Would support this company as their customer service is helpful :) 
7227 I think it was a little too expensive, but it does work well. 
7228 It works great 
7229 excellent camera, great photos and very durable. Arrived much earlier than expected - great all around! 
7230 Takes good photo s and video is decent,battery life is not good drains to fast must carry extra batteries. 
7231 Yes I decided to keep the Meike Battery Grip can you email me A reasonable price for Battery s for the Battery Grip for Canon 70 D thank you for your business 
7232 this is my second buy and came with several problems Not save the changes in configuration every time you turn off the car and start again reset the value to factory reset. so it s a good item but can t be sure if came or not with problems 
7233 Just what was needed. Thank you. 
7234 I was extremely pleased with the quality of photos and video from this camera, both above and below the water. I would definitely recommend it. 
7235 Prompt delivery and it works like promised. Thanks 
7236 The camera works beautifully. The night vision, and the fact we can check the app from anywhere is really cool! 
7237 O.O So many buttons. I ll figure it out though. It seems to be a great deal so far! 
7238 Works well. No instructions. 
7239 I have EXTREMELY small wrists, so it can still wiggle around a bit even tightened down on me. However, it s still super useful for many situations and being adjustable, I ve been able to let others use it when filming with my gopro. Glad I purchased. 
7240 Great camera!!! I have had several cameras and this is my favorite by far! 
7241 Had some glitches with the ejector for the film but it is overall a really good camera for the price. 
7242 Good product. 
7243 Does a wonderful job removing the &#34;dust&#34; particles - easy to carry and ready at all times. Every photographer should have one packed. Visit the truetoad site for reviews... 
7244 the tool doesn t fit 
7245 great 
7246 camera was a gift 
7247 The binoculars worked great. Took my granddaughters to a One Direction concert and our seats were in a higher section but with the Olympus we could see every eye color, smile and dance that the band performed. 
7248 Quick delivery. Everything was as portrayed. 
7249 Fits well. 
7250 Lovin these clips, waiting for the AA to be released 
7251 worked great for my camera, bought it a couple years ago and its still working great! 
7252 This is a great hand held telescope 
7253 Inlived ur product but i expected to have instax mini film included 
7254 good item 
7255 it s normal 
7256 Great. Very easy setup 
7257 It is good. It is a battery. What can I say? It charged up, it works. 
7258 All products came as advertised and work really well. No issues at all. The selfie stick does have a bit of a balancing issue since you cant lock it into a certain position but as long as you are not swinging it around like crazy it will stay upright. 
7259 The set is everything Inwas expecting. Shipping was quick! 
7260 Pretty good lights. Except that I don t like that the bulbs stick out past the &#34;cone&#34;. The lights have dropped to the floor and it breaks the bulb. That s annoying. 
7261 Loved this bag, looks nice feels well made and there are many bucket in it. 
7262 It was nicely made but soon came off the camera I had put it on. It was an experiment that failed. 
7263 I have been using the battery ever since I bought it and it works great. No issues at all and I would buy another one if I needed it 
7264 good to have on hand and works well for my needs. Thanks!! 
7265 good~~ 
7266 Awesome camera deal!! Camera is everything and more than I expected great buy in my opinion. 
7267 Excellent on all counts!! 
7268 I was very much satisfied with this product and received exactly what I ordered! 
7269 Met my expectations and all the extra stuff was great. 
7270 it is really good. Do not hesitate to buy it. I am totally satisfied with my purchase 
7271 Excellent bundle package. 
7272 Cant live without this case. 
7273 Package arrived on time and in good condition. Soft box was was easy to put together and held up well. Does a nice job with a speedlight 
7274 Too small for the A6000 when a lens is attached thereto. 
7275 Love the size of this camera. The video is not the greatest but for what you are spending it is nice. The water proof case is a nice addition. I took it on a rafting trip, no leaks. Nice combination. Very pleased with this set up thus far. 
7276 Great 
7277 Excellent product and seller. 
7278 It quickly charges my GoPro batteries without having to use the camera. The car charger is perfect for road trips. 
7279 Didn t fit my X100LE , way to tight , damaged the hotshoe upon removal ... I would give it 0 stars if I could 
7280 Excellent deal. Product just as described. 
7281 Nice item works great 
7282 The service reps stick with you to figure out how to fix. And they are very knowledgeable. Awesome! 
7283 Great item, my camera fits and I can carry an extra battery. 
7284 Excellent quality! 
7285 Excellent product, using with a Logitech c920 webcam. Sturdy construction, had the ability to lock at the perfect angle. 
7286 Small, simple, well made, and looks great! An indicator light for each battery shows when it s sufficiently charged, which is about all the info I need. 
7287 Just what I wanted and work great 
7288 Works great and I love the camera 
7289 Good 
7290 Cheap, but functional. The threaded ring came too easily out of the rubber piece. Collapses well, but I don t expect it to last too long without the rubber cracking. 
7291 Excellent buy. Good quality for the price. Bought two. One for my wife and one for myself. Beats sharing and having to constantly refocus. 
7292 great 
7293 Optically perfect but heavy. 
7294 Very nice case arrived in great condition. 
7295 I use this brush for scanning photos. It helps minimize dust between each scan. Does what it s suppose to. 
7296 Super, super! 
7297 Great stand! 
7298 Although claimed it does not work with D750????? 
7299 great for the price 
7300 Good Case 
7301 Really happy with the teleconverter and the results I am getting. The conversion of my nice nikon 1.8 50 mm into a 100 mm walk around lens AWESOME!!! 
7302 As advertised. 
7303 This Tripod is very wobbly. I put my camera on it and the legs bend extremely easy. I cannot recommend this product. it is cheaply made with cheap materials. I dont trust my camera with this Tripod 
7304 Arrived in great shape. Although it s a very basic lens it was exactly what was needed for the project. 
7305 returned... was not in shape stated. cat hair all over it...nothing worked properly. 
7306 The battery was of very good quality. Price was also excellent. 
7307 works as advertized 
7308 Hubby is sooooo happy with it. He;s still learning lots and enjoying it all. 
7309 Works well. I had bought one of these years ago for $50, and this one is just the same. When I ride by the house it looks occupied. 
7310 Great price for the kit. The flash itself is a work horse.. Doesn t over heat like bigger ones if you need to be able to shoot rapidly. 
7311 The set up is super difficult. If you can get past that, it is a good camera. I still haven t figured out how to record…I can only watch live 
7312 A great gift for an 80th birthday...She can now have her family with her always in the pictures of their lives which were downloaded for her! Easy to use! AMAZON DELIVERY WAS AMAZING...ON TIME AS PROMISED! 
7313 Great value for the price! Its a good combination of lenses/filters. The threads fit perfectly with the camera lens. Quality of the material used is also very good. 100% happy with the purchase! 
7314 GREAT service and prompt delivery. Unfortunately, the glasses were too big for my head but a friend took them and absolutely loves them! 
7315 Set up is pain 
7316 I had D link cameras too 
7317 and it didn t require port forwarding, and all other critical set up activities. It was just plug n play. Returning product and getting Dlink again. 
7318 Works fantastic with my 70d. Feels solid, button feedback is crisp and clicks not rubbery. There s a distinct off, half way and full press on the shutter. And the batteries fit perfectly and work perfectly. 
7319 Love this camera 
7320 Liked the selfie stick it was better than what i thought .. 
7321 GREAT 
7322 Seems to be poor quality - I don t really trust it. 
7323 Awesome speaker, tough as can b 
7324 And rather loud to, great for my PA system and air horn 
7325 This purchase went exactly as planned. Order, receipt, and function were all what I expected. Good job!! 
7326 Great product and exactly what I wanted! Works amazingly well! I was amazed at how well it helps remove reflections and also darkens the leaves of trees by cutting down their shine. Very happy with this filter! 
7327 Perfect. Just like the waterproof case, except with cutouts for plug ins. Works great, especially when driving long distances. Allows charging cable for the GoPro 
7328 VERY HANDY AND PRACTICAL,ALSO VERY CONVINIENT. I RECOMENDED. 
7329 perfect fit 
7330 A great wrist strap! 
7331 excelente 
7332 I also have a Go Pro 3 Black and found that the menu system sucked, the battery died way way to fast. The drift while larger has outstanding battery life and is very very easy to use. The remote is also way better than the go pro. 
7333 I like it very much 
7334 Great camera. Pictures are amazing and very easy to use 
7335 Works great. 
7336 Great Product for the price! 
7337 take some good pic night and day. 
7338 Worked ok 
7339 Purchased this watch for my 13 year old son and he loves it. Great price and much to my surprise great quality. This watch has held up to a 13 year old boy s abuse and keeps on going. Looks good too! 
7340 Great camera, with terrific picture. The new Nest app is easy to use and set up. 
7341 Excellent device! I would give it 5 stars but it is a pain to have to remove 4 screws just to change the batteries. 
7342 Was what I was looking for. 
7343 My teacher recommended the 13x19 portfolio, but I find it s just too big. So I had to buy a new one that s smaller but this one still was great quality. 
7344 The strap for the arm got broken 
7345 Missing pieces. No batteries, no lens cover. Did not know the item was refurbished. Very disappointed. 
7346 This is a great deal. The pictures are beatiful 
7347 Perfect, guaranteed, durable product. Amazingly fast shipping and superb customer service. 100% recommend. 
7348 Worked OK. 
7349 LED lighsts only works with with battery packs and not batteries. The lights were smaller than expected. 
7350 LOVE this camera. Definitely a much-used addition to my camera &#34;arsenal.&#34; 
7351 This is exactly what I needed and was much more affordable priced than from Canon! 
7352 I have used this film ever since I got my instamax mini and I have never had any problems. Every role I ve used has produced quality pictures. I haven t had the problem of getting a role that just keeps printing out white pictures. 
7353 had to play with it a bit to get it to work the way I expected to but the video is great and I use it now with no issue. 
7354 I took this camera on a road trip, and let me tell you, It produced great videos of my trip across the United States. 
7355 Shipped right on time! Amazing product. Bought this set for my trip 
7356 All the components are great quality. 
7357 Bought some flashes that didn t fit my hot shoe, this works perfectly. 
7358 This was the same type of a battery I had once before. Worked as expectedly. 
7359 Good 
7360 Greatest purchase! I use the pole for taking photos while sailing and you can get some really awesome shots! The pole allows you to get take pictures from angles that are impossible otherwise. So glad I bought this! Very cool item! Well made, very sturdy and secure. 
7361 Great stands!! I love them!! 
7362 very good product 
7363 Great filter, love the performance and it just feels high quality. Great buy! 
7364 Worked as advertised. Did get water droplets on the filter during the dive that were not visible till watching the video. Then again, the gopro was mask mounted, so got lots of bubbles. Dove to 90 feet, visibility was great, colors were accurate at depth. 
7365 All metal parts...high quality and it has lasted several years. Just bought another one because I was so pleased with the previous one. Don t waste your money on the cheaper ball head camera mounts. This one is the best. 
7366 no power cord! 
7367 Great Product 
7368 Very good 
7369 Good unit, decent recording ability, for $20, it s hard to lose. 
7370 Fits - timely delivery 
7371 Probably works great for small action recorders, but will not work with a dslr as they are just too heavy for the timer to be able to keep its balance while spinning. 
7372 everything works as advertised, very pleased, just ordered a second one. 
7373 It was my sister present! So great!!! 
7374 packed great, as advertised. 
7375 They work well once you get the right angle, but I think they could use a bit more eye relief than the twist-up eye caps offer. I sometimes find it difficult to acquire a view unless I play with the angle. 
7376 Very nice 
7377 works nicely and protects my screen well. does not affect my recording or images, clear right through. Thanks! 
7378 8&#62; Thank You $$$ 8&#62; :D ^^ 
7379 built like crap 
7380 Your device will slip out of the Phantom 3 tablet holder using this shield. Not a good fit. 
7381 Very simple but built well. No complaints and very pleased. 
7382 Easy to install & works well 
7383 Sucks, doesn t charge all 3 the same. POS!!!! 
7384 great 
7385 Awesome! 
7386 my family was heart broken at the loss we suffered my daughter wears this every day thank you 
7387 I use them to clean my glasses, they work great. Fast shipping. 
7388 Works just fine. 
7389 Works just as described! This is very moveable mount that works well. I d definitely recommend......note I haven t used this mount for more than 2 weeks but so far, so good. 
7390 I bought this to go with a large kit that included a camera, some lenses and filters but didn t include this item. This item worked well, was shipped quickly and was a great price, thanks a bunch, will buy again! 
7391 Great clarity and quality for the price. The app was updated, very disappointed. Its slow, sometimes it will just spool with no picture and i never had a problem with the the motion alert with the older app, now with the Vimtag it crashes! 
7392 Great value! 
7393 Works well when I need to use it on a frame. 
7394 Great package for the price. 
7395 It sucks 
7396 Wasabi batteries have been excellent. I ve used them in two other cameras and a camcorder. They communicate with the camera, have more capacity than the oem battery and I ve never had one die. 
7397 Remote works great and very helpful in my learning how to use my camera 
7398 Great product. Thanks for good business. 
7399 LOVE LOVE LOVE IT... CAME SUPER QUICK.....GREAT QUALITY BEST PRICE 
7400 Bought this for my grandson and does many great video now, he loves it , hes 16.... 
7401 Works well for the most part ... Wireless is a huge plus ... Takes a little tweaking but is pretty straight forward ... I added a 3rd camera and most likely will buy 2 more for the outside ... 
7402 Gives a good picture quality, housing seems rugged enough for the price. happy with this unit. 
7403 Worked well during my wife s European trip. Simple and functional. 
7404 Pelican, as always, a great product. Have several in use for the last 10 years and still working great. 
7405 Really like it. It holds a lot and the sections inside can be moved around to suit your needs. The adjustable straps are nice so whoever is carrying it can fit it to them. Don t miss my clunky camera bag one bit! 
7406 works great, i should have bought more, and probably will buy more in the future! 
7407 good mic for the low price 
7408 everithing OK 
7409 This package is legit. Buy it. 
7410 The float stick works well but after using it on vacation it already has water in it that won t come out. The extension stick is crappy, it s hard to extend. 
7411 No issues with it, highly recommend and a high quality product. 
7412 You need it, that s it. Best bang for the buck. 
7413 It s very nice!!!! i like all. 
7414 Great item and great seller 
7415 It is too bulky- when it is closed it s also too large still. 
7416 It seem very well made but I haven t use it at a live gig yet so I will report back if I have any problems. It has lot of hoops to hang accessories. So far I could not find any negatives. 
7417 Great units. Hi speed sync is fun. 
7418 DOES NOT FIT CHARGER ARE YOU SURE IT FITS Nikon D70S Is the S model different from d70 Batteries edges more square. I am going to return battery 
7419 I feel like I stole this item for what I paid. It works perfectly! 
7420 I am very pleased with my experience in making this purchase. Everything was as promised and was delivered very quickly. I would recommend this company based on my interaction. 
7421 It s a great camera bag! 
7422 Works! 
7423 Good saller 
7424 I have so many of these packs. They may not last as long as the Sony batteries, but my A7s it pretty power hungry so it s hard to tell. For the price, it s nice to have extra batteries in my kit. 
7425 The adapters worked as expected. Very inexpensive as well. 
7426 I Liked the camera and bundle so much, this was the second one I got for a family member! 
7427 I don t have to worry about losing the lense cap every again! 
7428 Great add on for my Cannon camera. No more running back to the camera for group shots. Works like a charm. 
7429 Very good product to my GoPro. 
7430 a little bit on the heavy side but sturdy enough to do the job and lighter than a tripod 
7431 These batteries physically fit the camera, but unfortunately did not work. 
7432 It is a great product. I felt a little hard to rotate the zoom, at the lens. 
7433 Got gere on time and works great with the camera 
7434 great camera delivered as promised 
7435 Simple to use. Clear picture. Fast shipping. 
7436 works initially but as time goes on the bubble starts to appear & it doesnt stick anymore 
7437 Great buy, especially for those that need the power and an almost universal flash. Pack has been going strong since purchased in 2007. I would highly recommend. Use a cheap shroud or soft cap for alternate effects. 
7438 They are realy good. Easy to install, and work perfect. 
7439 Fits perfectly. Looks great. Easy to use and great quality 
7440 It does what is should, but it is not a huge angle widening. I used it on my 50mm lens and it turned it into maybe a 45mm? The biggest downside is that you lose a bit of focus control since now you have an extra lens to distort through. 
7441 Overpriced for a piece of plastic, but it works as advertised. (It looks big, bulky, and silly when attached to the flash unit) 
7442 Great value and nice variety of useful items. Recommended!! 
7443 Didn t work for me. 
7444 Sensor works well inexpensive way to secure a room 
7445 Works Great!! 
7446 excellent product quality 
7447 Better than expected, I ve had it awhile now and it s still performing. Battery life could be better - but that s on nearly all speedlights. 
7448 The last flash that I bought is not properly shut continue on after turning it off , and the other does not work correctly the locking when mounted on the camera. 
7449 Terry Morgan provides the best tech support. Fantastic cam for the $$!!! 
7450 Advice for new parents, your iphone will need to be on ALL the time if you want to keep a constant watch. Otherwise, it s got a really clear picture even in the darkest of situations. Super easy set up. 
7451 Good 
7452 so far its doing great 
7453 This was a gift to my husband for his birthday. It is everything we had expected! 
7454 Very Good 
7455 I purchased this product. It came with NO instructions whatsoever. Can someone provide me with English instructions? 
7456 Great package 
7457 cool camera, impossible software. I spent like 3 hours trying to get it setup on WiFi and could not figure it out, even with the special support files provided by hoo too. not recommended for quick install. 
7458 Likely sufficient is shooting photos from the sidelines or traveling by car but for the hiker, too heavy, too bulky and too cumbersome. 
7459 Works fine. 
7460 Great chest harness, well worth the money. 
7461 Excellent 
7462 Great again and again!! 
7463 I got this to record my daughter s graduation. The picture is horribly grainy. I would note commend this camcorder at all. 
7464 Great Quality - we recommend this item! 
7465 There big and the made the cameras float and the price was good. 
7466 So far so good, Camera is sharp enough for close range, IR works great at night. My only beef that kept it at 4 stars is it being a tad slow when you pan around. Other than that its great. 
7467 Great already have couple of others. 
7468 it worked until iOS 8.4. now I have a useless camera. 
7469 batteries came fully charged and lasted a good amount before i had to recharge 
7470 Being a larger than average photographer, I was having a hard time finding a long enough strap so my camera would hang comfortably. This is exactly what I needed! Delivery was super-quick! 
7471 This harness is so awesome I cant tell you how awesome. I am still finding way that this makes my whole photography life easier. Get you one! Even with one camera it sits fine on my shoulders. 
7472 good 
7473 Should have purchased these instad of the X1 brand. Works great 
7474 works great with amcrest system 
7475 Good product. 
7476 The camera was in a very good condition. Just I didn t get then what &#34;body only&#34; mean, and buying a lense now is another $150 and also an SD card. So I might as well buy a new camera in that price. Thank you again. 
7477 Worked perfectly, no problems. Very good buy. 
7478 I really like it, shipping wasnt bad either 
7479 Works great and I like it, but it was a little expensive. Also had to pay extra for the articulating mounting arm (which I also like and thought was overpriced). 
7480 extremely cheap product. 
7481 Its very weak plastic. Broke when i was puting it for first time. Doesnt deserve any star 
7482 🙈👆🏻😍 
7483 Fits perfectly on my cannon rebel 3ti 
7484 Very cheaply made. 
7485 I can t figure out how the use it 
7486 FUJIFILM s best instant camera as of this date. 
7487 There is no second for this case, it is so far out front of any similar case for your expensive camera and or 1911 .45 Remington semi automatic pistol and several magazines. Again, there is no second for the quality of this case. RG 
7488 Good optics and works well with my DSLR. 
7489 Amazing amount of gear and really functional as well. 
7490 I m a cheap butt, and this gizmo got me the shots that I wanted.... 
7491 es como se esperaba. 
7492 Good 
7493 its so cool, the USB interface makes viewing them so easy 
7494 Excellent companion to body case. Very high quality 
7495 I was expecting the entire picture not just the backdrop. Probably will return. 
7496 Everything was as promised. Thanks! 
7497 Remote doesn t work. HDMI-out doesn t work. No instructions on how to view/setup online(the &#34;instructions&#34; for DDNS are incredibly vague and not helpful at all). Other than that, pleasantly surprised at the quality of picture and that the HDD was included with the DVR unit for under $200. 
7498 Arrived on Time! Great, clean NEW condition with everything in box. 
7499 performed as advertized 
7500 Awesome purchase especially for the price. Fits my camera perfect with a few accessories as well. 
7501 Great Product!!! fast Shipping!! 
7502 easy installation. Just take me less than 10 min to get it done. adjustable aperture is another sweet design for home use. Take it as a pet cam for my puppies. 
7503 Very satisfied with the transaction. Camera has excellent features for the price and fits easily into my pocket. 
7504 camera will not hold charge and I don t think its the battery, this is fine. 
7505 Had a difficult time uploading the video. Still have problems so I don t use much. 
7506 Very good 
7507 Batteries are great! Don t work with cannon chargers but work with the one it came with 
7508 IT IS MADE BY HIKVISION, BUT IT IS OEM. GREAT PRICE! 
7509 great transaction. Product as described 
7510 This stand works with the Neewer Camera Photo/Video 18&#34;Outer 14&#34;Inner 600W 5500K Dimmable Ring Fluorescent Flash Light for video recording. 
7511 Its all I need 
7512 Amazing bargain for an image stabilizer. 
7513 Perfect just what we needed. 
7514 Excellent product 
7515 Great little noise maker. No one comes into the house without my knowledge!!!!! Km 
7516 Great product, as advertised. 
7517 It didn t fit! I tried to make it fit and it broke. Now I am $25 lighter in the wallet. 
7518 Super.... 
7519 Good deal, easy to use and well worth the money as a refurbished unit( can tell - it looks new). 
7520 One of the items I don t regret buying. I use it as a organizer case for my various electronic components in my backpack, not just for my camera when I travel. Very purposeful beyond its original intent. 
7521 Nice 
7522 Amazing and used it through out a trip with a lot of hiking. 
7523 Works like a charm, affordable. Sony should have included it with its camera products. 
7524 Not as powerful as I had hoped. 
7525 leaves little spots all over the sensor. 
7526 Cool Kit 
7527 useless I returned it 
7528 Thought I d take a chance on this and i wasn t disappointed...great item and well worth the money 
7529 Great grip! 
7530 while this may be a good camera, we had to return it because it s rather bulky. Should ve looked closer at the pictures. 
7531 Great long and skinny chealplace for covering a 1/4 20 screw into various 1/4 20 and one 3/4.. I wish it had more 3/4 but what can a guy do? Work for me but might not work in every mounting situation. Do some research before buying. 
7532 Good!! 
7533 Nothing fancy, gets the job done for light activity. 
7534 The Go Pro suction cup mount is a great tool. As long as the surface is smooth and clean, you should be able to mount it without issues. 
7535 Not bad optics for an inexpensive macro solution...the swingaway mount is nice and handy--I just leave it on the camera. Good purchase. 
7536 What can i say, it s small, its heavy duty, it holds your lens caps (that aren t attached) & it should be included in every camera strap you buy... but it s not. Way to go guys at Vonoto... you filled my need exactly. 
7537 Love being able to check on the dogs while I m at my office and see what s happening at home when we re not there. 
7538 Thank you 
7539 Works great. Kids have used it a lot. Seems very durable. Lots of fun! 
7540 very good 
7541 Great speedlight. Everyone needs one 
7542 Do Not buy, Cameras do not last indoors or outdoors. Have add trouble contacting sellers to try and replace cameras. One by one they each died. 
7543 This was simple to install and really easy to use. 
7544 Sometimes works, sometimes takes few more seconds, first I thought It was because the camera needed time to focus but realize later the remote sometimes doesn t send signal. Battery draws very fast. 
7545 good product for the price, does everything expected 
7546 I love it 
7547 Decent product for the price. 
7548 Great fit for GH4, does just what it says and what it is suppose to do. I am able to mount Leica R glass to the GH4, which provides some great unique looks to video and photos. Would recommend. 
7549 ok 
7550 Came super quick. Just as described. 
7551 nice 
7552 Great floats! Love the bright colors that easily stand out in the water! 
7553 Handy item for carrying and providing easy access to required filters. 
7554 After charging them in my new charger, they worked just fine in my camera. 
7555 perfect replacement for my broken door 
7556 Works Perfectly. It can even fit a small tablet like my nexus 7 
7557 Pricey but works 
7558 Exactly as expected. Perfect case for my camera. 
7559 Works 
7560 It does work good. 
7561 Actually pretty good quality. It was simple to put together, and surprisingly easy to transport. 
7562 Fantastic! Great price, perfect condition, works amazing. Very satisfied. 
7563 GREAT UNDERWATER CAMERA!!! 
7564 As long as you realize these are standard def products and they sometimes have issues recording, nobody can beat the price/quality. You wont be disappointed. 
7565 Good product. 
7566 Don t try to take dry pics after taking underwater pics, water droplets will remain on the camera making all the pics you take look warped. Its really quite annoying when trying to take selfies with my head above water. 
7567 I can t complain at all about this purchase, it works perfectly for my needs and never fails. 
7568 Awesome 
7569 Check out my video review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNJ-LqryG2s It s the perfect secondary camera to your primary vlogging camera. Audio is the best GoPro has to offer and video quality is up to date. If you want to see a comparison to the Silver look at the video above! 
7570 Works like a charm with my t5i.. I still have it 6 months later. The battery died but i just popped it out the bottom and replaced it. You dont have to keep buying it.. Just change the battery you guys. Lol 
7571 Looks good feels good, I have taken video through it but haven t used it under water yet. It didn t distort or interfere with the video or pictures at all. I would buy this product again and recommend it to friends. 
7572 Lightweight and useful. Get the job done. 
7573 Perfect replacement for the original piece. 
7574 Works well. Can t rotate upwards at all though. 
7575 works fine although battery was real low only 1 bar when I got it but it charged up fine. 
7576 Looks durable. Fits my 600EX-RT very well. 
7577 Exactly what I needed for my shotgun mic 
7578 easy to use, precise, its reading is constant, its a great deal. I love it. 
7579 I really like it. Its everything that i expected. If build quality is a big concern keep in mind that this is a 20 dollar shutter release. Don t expect any more than what your e paying for. 
7580 The price is good, but the batteries do not mark the used percentage correctly.. so they hapen to die at any time with no notice. they don t work for me. 
7581 I went into this knowing it wasn t a high-end technological marvel. I use it to view printed samples under pretty high magnification and it works OK. Not great, not worthless. Right smack dab in the middle for the price. 
7582 Works. Delivered fast. A+++ 
7583 After using the camera 8 Times( bought july 22nd) one button stop working. I just checked the return policy and just expired the 30 days window. What should i do? 
7584 Saved my day! Just the right fit and performance works as I would expect. 
7585 I needed AC power for video and stop motion projects. This thing did the trick for the price. Can t complain. 
7586 Works as expected. Nicely made with quality material. 
7587 I love my Polaroid 
7588 The grip was not equipped to attach to the camera. A 2nd one was ordered and it was also missing the connection between the grip and the camera body. 
7589 works well 
7590 Works as well as any other filter set - and reasonably priced. 
7591 The quality is ok, but only 2 axes is a bit of a pain. Not the fault of the seller but I should have paid more attention. Was a good price so I ll find some use for it. 
7592 Audio is worthless. 
7593 Long camera rod. limited adapters. Wish it was made of metal so I can use it as a weapon also for self defense 
7594 Great product great price 
7595 Get what you pay for...zippers pull apart and seams have torn after a few months of occasional use. Not professional at all. If you use in home studio and don t move...work fine. 
7596 Bought two, only issue was the first one was programmed in Japanese, both work well were not to difficult to install. Have not been able to get the reverse camera to put up the grid in reverse. The directions are rather skimpy. 
7597 These are so fun to play with and a great alternative to the expensive colored Film. These are cheap and way more options. 
7598 It worked out perfectly!! 
7599 Very mobile and charges my camera batteries very quickly. 
7600 Great camera!!!! 
7601 Was not the quality of camera I was expecting. No instruction manual to tell you about the camera settings or how to use them. Accessories not for the same camera. So disappointed......... 
7602 I have used this item several times and great for the money. Durable and sturdy. The only thing that I was not impressed or found challenging was putting it together, but after watching several Youtube views I finally got it. Easy to pack way and comes with convenient carrying case. 
7603 TTL not reliable 
7604 This item does not project a clear video at night. When it switches over to black and white, there is a glare in picture- reflecting the camera image and as soon as it switches back over to color, the camera video looks fine. 
7605 Couldn t be happier! What a vendor! 
7606 small and sharp the lens hood doesn t lock falls off all the time pic come out sharp 
7607 very good item delivered as expected. 
7608 All good.. Perfect match.. 
7609 Great Selfie Stick There are so many selfie sticks available how do I choose? The fact of the matter is that most of them are very similar. Aluminum color, removable phone holder, & built in Bluetooth.The selfie is for fun and functional. 
7610 Works as advertised! I was a bit concerned about getting a generic battery for my camera, but with the official Sony battery being WAY too expensive, this was the only way to go. It worked flawlessly and gave me no issues at all. 
7611 The unit itself is decent the cameras are great resolution, but amcrest DVR s offer more capabilities, and worse yet the Hard drive failed in less than a week, requiring a warranty repair. 
7612 Does everything I wanted it to do. 
7613 Just a little tight, buts works great! 
7614 very small size, puffy, not comportable 
7615 Excellent for protecting artwork purchased at conventions. The sleeves can be full of static when you open them, so some weights of paper will be harder to put in than others will. 
7616 Service was execellent item arrived a day earlier than expected 
7617 I couldn t be more happy I would recommend to anyone 
7618 So far so good! 
7619 I am pleased with the product so far - it seems to have a good line of vision. Vincent was a great help to get my cameras set up on my wifi network 
7620 Cool 
7621 Great lens. People suggest this lens s boca effect is better than that of the 50mm f1.8 but I disagree! But it is a great lens to get those wider angle shots that you can t get with the 50mm. This and my 50mm make an awesome film making duo. 
7622 ok 
7623 I wanted to like this... I really really did. But it cannot hold the weight of a flash, receiver and umbrella. No matter how tight I made it. An entire shoot it was sideways. 
7624 Did not fit with the bundled flash unit. If seller is reading was disappointed with something that did not work. Less trouble to throw in the closet then return. 
7625 Great for the price, arrived quickly and fit my camera well. 
7626 easy to set up and excellent quality great customer service 
7627 it didnt fit 
7628 my wife loves her fujifilm instant camera. this is a bulk deal. 
7629 omg good 
7630 After using a different DVR system that just didn t quite match our needs, we came across this item and they are working perfectly. 
7631 Real like 
7632 Worked great 
7633 GREAT! Perfect for my needs. Highly recommend for home studio 
7634 The ball head is light enough not to put weight on a supporting arm, and strong enough to put a couple of lights or voice recorder on at no problem. It s nice to have several of them at my disposal. 
7635 High quality Fast delivery 
7636 my goddaughter loved her gift 
7637 Should have bought this sooner. I use the Manfrottos at work, bought this for personal use. I like it far more, though I wish the feet could be removed completely. 
7638 No more AA batteries and the weight that goes with them. 
7639 Works fine; fair quality. Better if had shutter activation button, available for same price in stores or online. 
7640 The product is great and easy to use, but the instructions are in broken english and don t really make sense. 
7641 These worked great for replacing existing switches that were damaged during window replacement.... Came with stick on double sided tape to make install on vinyl windows a snap... 
7642 Very disappointed. I own a60 d and side by side the t5i did not perform well. Indoor shots very dark and unfocused not sure if I got a bad copy of why. 
7643 cheaply made, does the job but you have to be careful with the case or it will break 
7644 Excellent toy 
7645 Highly rated for a reason! This camera does it all, and it had easy setup and easy operation. So pleased, we will be getting more! 
7646 good 
7647 Loved the length! but the sound quality is horrible, sometimes it sounded like i was under water! 
7648 Charged the batteries and they are working with no issues. Work in my Canon 70D just as advertised. 
7649 i m actually impressed by this. video is actually surprisingly good. pictures, not so hot. it has it s applications. 
7650 The picture quality is amazing. The camera was recommended by my fried that is a photographer and it has exceeded my expectations. Fantastic camera, great price and it comes with everything you need! 
7651 It was fun to be able to actually see the photos and pass them around for a laugh or too. to compare the dress up of the kids immediately was loads of fun. 
7652 He print a handbook for me, thanks a lt. 
7653 Good. 
7654 Exactly as described works wonderfully with our LG G4, no third party app needed. Very fast shipping.. 
7655 Good price. Go through these pretty fast with Arlo cameras. 
7656 This charger works great. With the wake feature I was able charge my old battery that wouldn t charge from my original Canon charger. The display is nice as it gives you a better idea as to the charge level and completion. 
7657 OEM, no quality problem 
7658 Works fine 
7659 Nicely made. Some pre-cut foam areas are oddly shaped and GoPro accessories won t fit. 
7660 plastic that you cannot even use. This appears to be a solid snap on piece like the water case, it is not. it is in fact a rubber mold, all one piece and was worthless. I trashed it. 
7661 nice package, everything included. 
7662 Not worth the money! 
7663 so far so good great for the cost. Batteries aren t the snuggest but it works and they stay put 
7664 Great replacement cords for the Zendure. Nice/fair price for three pack of replacement cords. Highly recommend! 
7665 Though not made by Nikon, this package is worth every dime spent. All items worked as described. Who could ask for anything more. 
7666 it works very good. 
7667 works perfectly. 
7668 I love it. It is worthwhile to buy it. 
7669 By far the best camera for a beginner and someone looking to start photography. As many of the other reviews have stated, the tripod is extremely flimsy but everything else in the package will exceed all of your expectations. This is definitely worth the price. You won t be disappointed. 
7670 Great product works great 
7671 Would not buy this again. The camera quality is not there but the app is even worse 
7672 i gave up on it and now the camera sits in a box. 
7673 Picture could be a little clearer and instructions should be in larged. Not read the fine print. 
7674 Arrived as promised and was the proper battery worked just fine, already charged. 
7675 ok 
7676 Low price. Works great. 
7677 Some film didn t come out 
7678 Awesome camera 
7679 Kind of wimpy and cheap style 
7680 Perfect fitting adapter. Couldn t ask for any more from a $20 adapter. 
7681 We got this for my daughter s 13th birthday. She loves it! 
7682 Received as pictured. 
7683 great little bits to keep in the bits-n-pieces camera stuff 
7684 Ok but still not the standard fifty 
7685 Didn t get the 1/4 inch loops for the camera bodies???? The strap feels good but I was a tad disappointed to discover the item was not complete... I m assuming the camera connection screws were supposed to be in the kit? 
7686 Can t beat it for the price! 
7687 Perfect little album 
7688 Did not work 
7689 Great product. Lost one Samsung phone in the lake when we hit a wake, between a dry bag and the yellow floats, this won t happen again. 
7690 Doesn t work in lowlight. 
7691 Works much better than other products on the market. I m satisfied. 
7692 Good for price exactly what I expected no more or less 
7693 This is a great little attachment. I was leaving my lens cap off and misplacing it constantly, until I attached one of these. Simple and effective. 
7694 Great product and fast shipping 
7695 great product would recommend it 
7696 Used to keep an eye on my dog during the day... and be able to tell her to knock it off if she s doing something naughty! Great product, super easy to set up. Very pleased. 
7697 Tighten the screws on the legs.. Other than that great tripod 
7698 I couldn t resist the style or Amazon s great price on this adorable, functional new leather case for my new Sony camera! 
7699 Excellent product 
7700 If your GoPro is attached to a selfie stick, you will need to use both floaties. Good stuff! 
7701 imitation, fake, counterfeit 
7702 Material that touches my neck irritates it. Wish i hadn t wasted my money. 
7703 Great camera, fast shipping 
7704 What a handy guide to have in your bag. I ve read the books and now carry this reference guide with me. Good advice for mere pennies. 
7705 Great stand for shooting YouTube videos with my iPhone. It s totally flexible and works great! 
7706 Love these filters, they really do let your high-end lenses perform. Cheap filters can add a lot of crap to an otherwise great lens. 
7707 Was a very quick order actually received two days ahead of schedule, extras in box were a nice touch and unexpected. Was quite happy with lense itself... 
7708 it works fine, fast delivery. 
7709 I like it,would like it better if it came with an ac\dc power chord. 
7710 barley holds to the glass 
7711 Loved it! 
7712 Unable to figure it out. Still trying. 
7713 Pointless A/V out, it already had Mini HDMI. an A/V Input would be much more useful 
7714 Works as advertised. I look at the sun daily, if it s out. Only drawback was that the telescope fits very tightly in the case. 
7715 Great lens! A little distortion though, but has worked well for astrophotography for me on sony a6000 
7716 Don t crank the head all the way up or it will stick. Other than that, it s great. 
7717 Works great 
7718 working great 
7719 Fits magic mouse VERY snug. 
7720 Terrible resolución only works with one user lags all the time, kills phone battery. worst camera on the market. 
7721 Just what I needed 
7722 Item was as expected and promptly arrived on time 
7723 Was just what I wanted. 
7724 The charger works great, but rating the Smatree Batteries at 1200mah is disingenuous. Neither last as long as an original GoPro battery rated at much less. 
7725 excellent product. 
7726 works but screams cheap. my MOVO motorized head is infinitely better for not much more money and also can be controlled as to transit and duration. 
7727 Solid filter, smooth rotation. I can t find any faults. Love this company s attention to detail and customer service followup. If you re looking for a CPL on a budget, Breakthrough s X1 is a solid choice. 
7728 I think this kit has all the accessories I can use to keep my Pentax K-50 camera clean and in good condition. 
7729 A good replacement for the original supply. 
7730 it fits perfect on my advance mini shoe of a Vixia HF G20, 
7731 only one zipper, so they leak a little. i ordered them to hold down soccer PUG s, and they work great for that. 
7732 Fit perfectly and if you wash it first and hang it moist it will dry smooth. 
7733 Works well and is reasonably priced. Next time, I would buy the larger size because the 3&#34; X 5&#34; size is just a little bit too small to handle effectively. 
7734 Love it 
7735 would not charge 
7736 perfect! 
7737 For the price it s amazing. 
7738 It s a good switch for dimming. It requires a neutral but it seems to dim smaller numbers of LEDs better than Lutron s non-neutral offerings. Just make sure you have access to the RadioRA 2 software beforehand. 
7739 Good product 
7740 Its a good little fanny pack, my guess is you pay a lot for the name. Also, despite the photo it does not come with a water bottle holder. 
7741 The camera would not generate the IP address needed for set up. Tech support started out with &#34;is it plugged in&#34;, seriously. I spent several hours troubleshooting, waste of time. 
7742 Very good equipment 
7743 very cute camera, can be powered by usb cable via computer. Easy set up, two way audio is very clear, clear picture. very suitable for baby room. 
7744 Better than I expected. Very sturdy and well built for the price. Only con is the lower section needs to be a little deeper. 
7745 We now have 3 of these around the house. They work well & allow me to keep an eye on my kids while they re in their rooms! Love them! 
7746 Hold the camera and fits over my fat head. No complaints. 
7747 awesome 
7748 Great Value! 
7749 Works as advertised and screen is easy to see 
7750 Easy and fun to use! 
7751 loving it 
7752 Great case!!! 
7753 great case love it 
7754 nice item 
7755 A great design, I ve used it numerous times already, the way it attached to a belt loop is great, (an angle) great zippers, great design and materials for my Sony Camera. 
7756 Works great, but it s literally just a 60minute egg timer. You can easily make one yourself for just a few bucks and a little ingenuity. 
7757 Works great, extra batteries are more powerful than the original camera battery. Very good price. 
7758 Exelent 
7759 Love it 
7760 this is a piece of junk. Wifi camera won t start Web site is in chinese - no help there. Instructions are very confusing 
7761 Love them easy to put on and take off and gives some supper pictures !!!!! Thanks Deb 
7762 Bought to store cigars while camping. 
7763 Camera arrived as advertised. Very pleased with it. No issues. 
7764 Excelente 
7765 Price was right and it continues to work well 6 months later. 
7766 Connects my camera to the DVR on my surveillance system. They do the job. 
7767 Easy to set up, stable won t tip over. mine had no carry case if it did it would get another star. Works get for product pictures on a white back ground, not so goof for clothing site. Room will not warm up much. 
7768 Great idea but little pricey. Janeb 
7769 High quality. Excellent 
7770 Works great until they break at the foot of the 600ex-rt. 2 recent ones broke only after several months of use - the plastic used here apparently is not nearly as good as previous versions. 
7771 A++++++++ Highly Recommend 
7772 Turned out to be a little smaller than I was hoping for, but I still love it!! Really only fits my camera with a lens attached and then a second lens. 
7773 Great product and prompt shipment! Thanks!! 
7774 great price 
7775 This is excellent for those occasions when you have to work without an assistant. 
7776 Great little flashlight. And it really is waterproof. 
7777 Looks like a toy. Doesn t work as great as i thought it would. 
7778 If your an action person, excellent 
7779 Fits nicely, makes using the GoPro while riding a motorbike or even driving much safer 
7780 It has a nice feel, but with the weight distribution it was hard to keep from spinning. 
7781 These studio lights serve their purpose. What a great purchase. 
7782 Fantastic! Planning on purchasing the DCR-250 as well! 
7783 Fits my camera perfectly. 
7784 It has high-quality video capabilities but it is not as functional as the FujiKam HD. It is stationary and cannot be moved remotely using the available mobile app. 
7785 Nice thick cables, worked well. 
7786 Always buy extras so you have them to replace if you shoot a lot out doors. 
7787 Battery works well in Nikon camera. I have had them for a few months now and under moderate use the batteries do now not hold a charge as long as they did initially. 
7788 Thankyou 
7789 well I am trying the tummy slimming body women s shapewear it is made with quality material and is very interesting to wear feels great..great product..I received this product in exchange for an honest review.. 
7790 My daughter is a youtube wannabe star so I had to set her up right! she loves it 
7791 Does not come with the case as descibed. Will not work without it. 
7792 Works as advertised and expected of a Nikon product. 
7793 Great package of products! Everything you need to start taking great pictures. Very pleased. 
7794 Wow! This a the perfect case for the Phantom. It is well designed and tough! 
7795 Good quality --better made than most albums at this price. I will buy another one. 
7796 Does what I need as extra battery power 
7797 Charged batteries one time so far with no problems. 
7798 Love these little albums. Perfect for mini 8 camera. The color of the album matches my camera. Love that. 
7799 Got it fast, works great. I absolutely love this feature on the Nikon D3300. 
7800 The color is great but it requires a lot of editing to smooth out the background. This is my only seamless that shows up as wrinkled/dented in photos. 
7801 so cool - my daughter is having a blast using this and all her friends are looking into getting one as well 
7802 Great delivery time. Work great. 
7803 Product as promised 
7804 Great tripod! Inexpensive, but works well for iPhone 6+ and my Nikon D300. 
7805 Simple to set up, clear picture quality. 
7806 Not the best, but very usefull! 
7807 Surprisingly solid. 
7808 This is great. Wish I had gotten it BEFORE the screen got all scratched up in the first place. 
7809 The Clik holds my D700 with battery holder and 15-30, 2.8 lenses attached, 2 flashes, 2 other lenses and my 13&#34; macbook pro and all essentials. Great comfortable backpack. 
7810 dropped it and it still works! Takes great pictures, get a lot of good comments on them. recommended to my friends who ask what camera it is. 
7811 Very good product works great only thing I would do is bring back wave points 
7812 I travel with SLR & Hasselblad camera equipment. This shoulder pad will work on any strap. If you need relief from weight ..this strap is it. 
7813 Just don t do it...... Had to send my camera to Canon after this caused my camera to short. $400 to fix the camera. Just don t buy it..... If you buy it make sure you don t use it. 
7814 Have taken awesome pictures with it still don t think I have met full potential 
7815 Totally cute! 
7816 I do like this product. My only complaint is that the straps could be a little bit longer. It works as advertised, keeping the camera stable at your side. It is much, much better than your typical neck strap. 
7817 I have my car as and equipment in this case. I love the protective compartments in the case. 
7818 Very happy 
7819 Absolutely an amazing lens, even on my outdated Epl-5. 
7820 bad focus 
7821 Fits - timely delivery 
7822 Great case! 
7823 love the low profile and wide base, great for bench rest shooting for my spotting scope 
7824 Works good. 
7825 Works fine 
7826 This Camera is no where near 1080p full hd...very graining videos ....here is a sample video http://youtu.be/xlbcBhx98NI 
7827 Room for everything 
7828 Gives you a little sparkle to your pictures 
7829 Just perfect , thought , tight and smooth , I use this for my two super takumar in a 5D 
7830 It is very useful. 
7831 Beautiful and beautifully crafted! Absolutely love this. Quick delivery as well. 
7832 Item arrived on time and works great! 
7833 It worked well straight out of the box. the packing was adequate to protect it and assure safe arrival. The arrival was timely as advertised. 
7834 not for a nex 3 
7835 Love it! 
7836 I guess I missed the part about this being a flimsy tripod, but then you get what you pay for I guess. 
7837 Very nice picture,easy to use and works better than three other brands bought. 
7838 This item broke within 10 minutes of me wearing it. I am very dissatisfied with this product. My camera is now sunk to the bottom of the ocean floor due to their faulty product. 
7839 this is a great case. i wish the leather looked a little more weathered. it s a little plastic like look but it s ok. hopefully it wears out a little to give it a cooler older look. 
7840 Everyone needs one of these.... unless you don t know how flight works. Then please, for the love of God, don t. 
7841 They didn t explain how to use them so they are pretty worthless. 
7842 Works as expected. Fits wrist comfortably; floats camera. Good quality. 
7843 Good size and light weight, the zipper tag did rip making the zipper only 3/4 to close the bag. 
7844 Good Quality! 
7845 Sturdy, well-built piece of gear. Able to shoot in landscape or portrait orientation with simple twist of the locking knob to rotate the swivel head. 
7846 it worked great 
7847 Awesome! 
7848 Just what I wanted. 
7849 Older camcorder and the power adapter got lost. Now I can down load all those 8mm videos.... 
7850 My daughter and her hubby love them. If they are happy, so am I !! 
7851 Great light protective cover 
7852 quick delivery. Would order again 
7853 love it...light! 
7854 Awesome camera!! 
7855 Bought and shipped from Chinese dealer for $100.00 US. The price was GREAT and it arrived new in the box. It works perfectly. I would avoid all non OEM adapters as they are all loose fitting. 
7856 Needs a carry case. Works great even though color temp should be 5500 instead of 5400. It s still a little green. Not a problem with white balance. 
7857 Great deal! 
7858 they did really geart ,we got al lot of photos from these cameras 
7859 Love being able to take anywhere and the selfi feature! 
7860 Great camera. Good transaction. 
7861 Fit perfectly wirh my sony a6000 camera. Thanks. 
7862 This product may work well, but I wanted and expected it to be white (looks very white on your web site). It is gray!! Now what? 
7863 Its not an expensive filter, works well for the price but when you want high quality in your pictures buy a high quality filter. 
7864 thin , easy to use 
7865 great camera. Takes great pics for the money 
7866 good 
7867 Very nice quality! Filled with gravel and despite the weight it is holding up well! I especially like the double zipper. I doesn t give me the impression it s going to open and spill the contents everywhere. The size also fits securely over my tripod legs. Highly recommend! 
7868 Everything went fine 
7869 Perfect size for a 7&#34; monitor and cords. 
7870 They are pretty much perfect. Durable, open wide enough, not too expensive. I m happy with my purchase. 
7871 Great product 
7872 Works great when changing telescope lenses at night. Well made. Highly recommended. 
7873 Filters worked great in 20-40 feet of water. I don t have experience with other filters but it was much better than no filter at all. We slipped the filter on after submerging to prevent bubbles. 
7874 Really good definition and practic. 
7875 great bag, it has a weather proof cover in the front zippered area 
7876 Awesome, floats and good quality fit 
7877 The battery can last around 3 hours after one charge.It works great on my 2m LED strip. The LED indicator on battery shows on or off of switch. It turns green while battery be full charged, Great 
7878 Works great!! I bought this with the ASUS S1 LED Projector, and they are a perfect combo!! 
7879 Works surprisingly well. I wiped significant grease and smudges off my sunglasses with no cleaning solution or water. 
7880 The originals at a reasonable price quickly delivered 
7881 it works 
7882 The zipper is hard and bendibg didnt think a higer tier pro bag will be that hard to close zipper my canon 6d fits inside even with a battery grip with a tiny bit of pressure and kit lens 24-105 attached gave it 3* only because of the bending zipper 
7883 This charger worked great for 3 months and then died. 
7884 Love love love! Can t stop taking pictures!! 
7885 The camera and accessories were the highlight of the party. The kids were able to take pictures home to keep rather than waiting for the emails. The different lenses and the covers for the pictures worked out well. 
7886 Have yet to try it snorkeling, but above water it is fine. 
7887 Lightweight and durable. 
7888 We got these for our Arlo security system. Even fully charged, they did not show as &#34;fully charged&#34; They were dead in a matter of hours. Definitely not worth the price. 
7889 Not very secure or stable 
7890 Small and effecient. Foot adhesive was a bit frail. One of the feet pulled off. 
7891 Great camera, great seller. 
7892 Pleasure doing business with! Everything as promised! 
7893 The only thing that I am a little disapointed in is that it is not fully waterproof. Thanks for your quick delivery Vic Sheahan 
7894 Just right 
7895 Works great. Very adjustable. 
7896 Much larger and bulkier than the Nikon version. 
7897 Good unit at the right price. Make certain the focal plane is absolutely vertical, and you will yield great results. 
7898 Exactly what I needed and at a very reasonable price. 
7899 Never work....... Waist of money. 
7900 At least half of these so far have had little to no charge but still way cheaper then the energizer or Duracell options. 
7901 Meh. The tripod broke almost right away, so don t buy it for that. The rest was OK. 
7902 Perfect 
7903 This product was smashing amazing. Arrived so quick and was well packaged. Great explaination of how to apply it. And I wasn t expecting to get protector for the view finder and the control panel. So was really impressed. 
7904 Good case 
7905 Buyer beware! It is O K for the price. Sometimes it does not work. 
7906 awesome product. I have tried some of the standalone versions, some cheaper some more expensive. This has been the best by far. 
7907 This is a very sturdy and useful mount. I use it frequently in the shoulder position. I m impressed at its stability. It s a very clever and flexible design and has encouraged more frequent usage of my Action Cam. 
7908 Great filter. 
7909 I am sure that it will be fine when I finally receive the Adapter/Charger which has been delayed twice already! 
7910 This bag has all I need, I am very happy with the size and all storage bags it has. In summary this bag is perfect to someone that loves to travel light but with everything necessary to take good photographies. 
7911 Not interactive window. Otherwise nice case 
7912 Does not support the weight of my standard digital slr camera. 
7913 Just as described works perfect I would recommend this product to family and friends 
7914 TriPod stand broke after a few uses 
7915 Work well to protect lenses. 
7916 Fantastic macro lens for close-up nature photography and slight telephoto (like a 60 mm on an old film slr.) Excellent price. It s a little bigger than a compact telephoto. Works well with my ds5500. I am very pleased with this lens. Bought from Beach camera- great, fast shipping. 
7917 Cheaper than old polaroid film and better imho 
7918 The lense does a great job. I paid for the 2x converter as well but didn t get it. So you won t get everything you pay for, beware. 
7919 As good as expected slowmo 60fps and 120fps amazing quality and with removable Battery plus 2 hour record fantasic for Martial arts if your an instructor. Price is another plus looking at another since I use the three camera setup. Back up good idea 
7920 JUST GOT IT TODAY...BETTER THAN I EXPECTED!!! THANK YOU 
7921 Works great, much better pic than the cheap one I had before, I need to get the second one installed out back real soon. 
7922 I use a pair of these to place multiple flash heads in 72 inch parabolic umbrellas for large group shots. It is well-built and sturdy. 
7923 Works great 
7924 Excellent case! It gives plenty of room for all the various items you need for a day of flying! 
7925 Almost completely satisfied but one of the lens did not fit my camera! 
7926 Excelente!! 
7927 Nice ..big ..great price 
7928 Everything was as stated and good quality for a great price. 
7929 Works great and has last up to my teenager thumping it around in the camera bag. 
7930 cannot get sound to work and pic quality is real bad, will never get another one. 
7931 Easy hookup and met my expectation: now i can finally spy on my neighbors. 
7932 Good quality, worked well. 
7933 Perfect camera 
7934 Room for my quick disconnect prop guards, 3 batteries, my tablet, controller and my props. Great quality! 
7935 Good 
7936 Exactly what I needed. Great price. Works as advertised. 
7937 It did not come with a selfie camera, so while it still works as an Instax, I give it one star for lying on its description. 
7938 I am electrical engineer with RF / wireless & US air force sensors training. it is hard to imagine a better value for home alarms than this fortress system...highly recommended :) 
7939 Great to have it. nice packaged. 
7940 great 
7941 I was looking for a good time laps camera release...WORKS GREAT 
7942 This little camera recorded the burglary of my home. Police officers viewing images captured the by Nest Cam recognized the robber! Now the crook is in jail with his 6th burglary charge. Can t brag enough about this camera. 
7943 GREAT 
7944 My kid loved it 
7945 Terrible quality 
7946 better than expected for the price 
7947 Say somthing and comes opposite 
7948 Battery doesn t last long. It died to quickly. 
7949 fits stands and umbrellas 
7950 The camera and kit were exactly what I expected and worked perfectly. 
7951 Amazing little camera!! Very interested in seeing the next release as well! Very cool device! The size is amazing and the quality is pretty good too. Battery life is not so great, but to be expected with the size of the device as well as reading other reviews. 
7952 Great item -reat Product - love the way it operates so smoothly. 
7953 Well worth cost. Batteries work great. 
7954 Works for me. 
7955 An excellent alternative to OEM 70-300mm lens — just as good as Nikon or Canon for less money. 
7956 It works great and the price is very good. 
7957 Excellent little battery and price point. 
7958 fast delivery. Good product. 
7959 this camera is really neat. the service folks were great. I highly recommend fujicam 8/10/2015 
7960 Fits just fine on my hero 4 black. I was a little scared at first that i would break it trying to get the case over the camera, but it seems to be pretty durable. Best thing is that you can charge the camera while it is in the case. 
7961 Does the job! It is pretty big, bigger than I expected. I didn t really pay too close attention when I ordered it or I would have gotten the medium just because it would be easier to store. 
7962 Perfect case to put all my lenses and bodies together for a remote shoot. 
7963 My fiancé loved using it at the beach! 
7964 I am very happy with the accessory kit I received for my Nikon Coolpix AW 120. I would recommend this to anyone. 
7965 Nice little package. Everything I wanted and expected. 
7966 Not even got the charge, and this is the second one i bough from Amazon the first one was broken at the time of delivery. 
7967 Worked out great. 
7968 I feel whimsical when I watch movies on it! 
7969 I was delighted with the product supplied. 
7970 Charged my Canon battery as soon as I received this charger, no problems at all in installing or charging. 
7971 Arrived 4 dias before! excelent! 
7972 Great and fast service 
7973 Nice Tripod, very stable and easy to use! 
7974 Sent it back. Instructions way too complicated for my technology capable husband. A gift for him. He spent one entire day trying to input a all the info. I should have listened to the reviews I read and bought something else. 
7975 Works well 
7976 Hard to setup. And battery life sucks. Will be returning it 
7977 Batteries fit well and last as long as the OEM battery at a great price. Love being able to charge 3 batteries at a time. 
7978 Great item, very strong base. Thank You 
7979 Product was exactly as described and at a great price and very fast delivery !!! Will be back to this sellers page !!! 
7980 Works good with camera and is fun to use 
7981 Worked for about 1 second with the new batteries that I purchased with this order. Back it goes!! 
7982 Shipping was fast and order was exactly what was described. No complaints on this order 
7983 Poor quality. You can get the same quality for $4 in Chinatown 
7984 love it!!! 
7985 I really like this camera, its light and easy to carry around with me and have a manual mode. 
7986 OK so far.. No problems to report. 
7987 Optic are kind of okay but your phone adopter is very poorly made it it is off the track very easy and flimsy!!! 
7988 Excelent product 
7989 Good! 
7990 Very fun glad I had it for my trip! 
7991 Excellent product. Thanks! 
7992 This camcorder looks absolutely gorgeous. Once you get used to the controls which are very simple, using it becomes second nature. The recording quality is great. Truly a great deal. 
7993 Snapped in riptide current. 
7994 Gracias! 
7995 Great! 
7996 The UV Filter was an excellent product and is working very well. 
7997 did not work well. 
7998 Very easy to apply - just follow the instructions. All but invisible when fitted and works exactly as described. 
7999 What s not to love? It s the Cadillac of quads, the one against which all others are measured. 
8000 Great camera with an impressive zoom. Haven t tried the wi-fi feature yet. Controls are logical and easy to use. 
8001 Very cute, makes great pictures 
8002 as advertised 
8003 I own Lion Security Specialist Inc.to compete i look for great values and this was one, thank you Amazon. 
8004 Had issues with the battery! would not take full charge. 
8005 My daughter is very pleased with the gift I got her. 
8006 Feels cheap but its works fine. 
8007 It was cheap and it works 
8008 Got it fast and works perfect. Nice to have an extra, I m sure I will order another as I tend to lose these 
8009 This was a European model so the power supply had a European plug Had to call and buy a 120v power supply...bummer 
8010 i can t believe this. the software is on amazon although foxhole has stopped supporting it. so why was it sold to me and why did i waste my time learning how to use a software that is no longer supported? This is a matter worthy of litigation 
8011 So far so good. What an awesome deal! Exactly as described. 
8012 Item is as described. Works great. 
8013 Junk. I was trying to save money but instead got a flash that fell apart, didn t work, and took up space in my bag. Spend the extra and get the one for your camera from the manufacture. 
8014 Fits screen perfectly and stays where you need it. I will getting more of these for sure. 
8015 very nice step up ring, my lenses and filters love it. 
8016 Great image quality, awesome zoom. Great versatility in choosing photography settings, as well as making movies with zoom or making highspeed video (slow motion). And all in one rather compact camera. 
8017 Good charger Worthless batteries 
8018 Batteries seem to work as advertised. No long term experience yet. Delivery was much sooner than expected. 
8019 EXCELLENT COMPLETELY MET MY EXPECTATION 
8020 perfect. this one is your absolute best bet. i ordered another brand before this one for less money and had to throw it out. this one is well worth the money, bulit well and works as it should. 
8021 I see you 
8022 I take this everywhere I go. I havent met someone who has had this one yet but i always get some looks for having the coolest pole. The grip is comfortable and the arm extends to a pretty decent length. Its sturdy even when extended. Highly recommend! 
8023 Excellent screen protection film kit which I bought from Amazon UK and applied to both of my Pentax 645D camera bodies. Very easy to apply, it is giving good protection to two cameras in constant daily use. Thoroughly recommended, a great product. 
8024 I like this tripod for what i need it for which is not every day use. Its definitely sturdy for my camera. Only complaint the quick release plate had a piece fall off of it the first day. But i am pretty happy with it 
8025 loved this fits everything you need for a shorter trips! 
8026 Defective 
8027 Love this camera. It is versatile and easy enough for the point and shoot crowd, but allows novices to advance to intermediates and it allows intermediates to move up a few levels. 
8028 Easy to use and clarity is awesome 
8029 Light and junky but gets the job done. 
8030 LOVE having a spare battery while vacationing! 
8031 Works perfectly with my Canon Rebel T5. Very economical and you can t beat the performance. 
8032 Not too bad for the price 
8033 VERY NICE THANKS GUYS !! 
8034 Watch for Warranty! Got 2 of this a couple of month ago and 1 got out of order, and Hikvision refused it s warranty coverage. Very bad![[ASIN:B00G7GMEOG Hikvision DS-2CD2032-I Outdoor HD 3MP IP Bullet Security Camera 4mm]] 
8035 Returned it due to difficulty setting up. 
8036 Has worked great. 
8037 We got these for the father-in-law who misplaced the charger for his camera. This package with two additional batteries was the perfect answer to prepare the father-in-law with everything he needed for a week long trip to the National Parks. 
8038 High quality and a reasonable price. Smooth rotating and good results (as good as the photographer). Why paying so many $ for other. Very satisfied. 
8039 Smooth transaction. Fast shipping. A+++. Thanks!!! 
8040 My 13 year old Granddaughter loves it ! 
8041 Just as described. 
8042 I ve yet to be able to get it to work correctly...but I m hopeful 
8043 I have been having entirely too much fun with this lens. 
8044 Can t go wrong for the price. 
8045 Worked fine until she took it and got it stolen. 
8046 Plenty stout and versatile for my full sized rebel Cannon digital camera. 
8047 Not only does it have physical zoom, it has a digital zoom. Even at maximum zoom the pictures are crisp and clear. Easy to use. Great pictures. What a camera is supposed to do. Have not tried the video. Still it does what I want. Anything else is pure bonus. 
8048 works fine but found the lost one two hours after i ordered this one 
8049 good value, it supports my heavy 20-60 x 80mm Vortex Viper spotting scope well. A product really has to knock my socks off to get a 5 star 
8050 As advertised. Great camera, arrived on time. 
8051 Works great Extra one in case I lose the first one 
8052 Excellent product, first I bought 1 camera after I installed by the way easy installation , the night vision is way better them those expensive ones. I decided to buy two more , clean colors ind zoom work great. 
8053 It s very nice, works well 
8054 Love camera and All the advantages 
8055 Two day prime was five days! And the new camera I bought may have been factory reconditioned. Charger and Battery don t work. have to return. Either bad luck or bad business... 
8056 Feels big and cheap, especially compared to the OEM charger, but it works. 
8057 잘 받았습니다 I received well! Actually i canceled many times(of dollar converting issues) but seller didn t care when i saw. anyway thanks x 1000000 times!!! have a nice day ~ (from korea) 
8058 good 
8059 Works good! got it set up in no time. 
8060 works as described good fitment 
8061 Excellent, fast and small. 
8062 Gorgeous packaging and a nice little velvet case. Works flawlessly, with a larger button that is easier to press than the stock one I lost. Great purchase! The slide-out easy battery replacement is a plus also. 
8063 it works. 
8064 as described. 
8065 Good Value for a case. the foam is easy to use and customize. quality is not premium, but it is quite good and good enough for most uses. 
8066 excellent product. 
8067 I happy with it. Just wish it had a rechargeable battery. 
8068 No happy with this product. No smooth swivel action. Very jerky and hard to turn. I never should have bought. 
8069 Great product that fits perfectly onto my stands that I use for video and photography. A little on the cheaper side but still gets the job done nonetheless. Holds my flashes just fine. 
8070 I love it! very nice and trendy. I received the item earlier than I expected. Thank you Amazon and MegaGear. 
8071 This is my 2nd Panasonic 7-14. I flooded my original lens by accident getting out of my kayak. The Panasonic GX7 camera the lens was attached to had no such issues and survived the dunking quite well. This sample and my original 7-14 lens were remarkably sharp and well corrected. 
8072 Yes, it works and the arduino knows about it. 
8073 Fantastic product. It feels like part of the camera. I should have picked the darker leather, but that s my fault. 
8074 love it. 
8075 Did not come with the two rubber inserts. 
8076 It is a very good starter set for this camera 
8077 I took it to Hawaii and went zip lining! They had a helmet with a GroPro clip! Its small but mighty 
8078 Great camera, has everything I need to get started. This is my first DSLR and I find it quite easy to use. 
8079 This is a great camera bag. Highly recommend. 
8080 Great product as described!!! Awesome seller! 
8081 I love flashpoint products, this one is no different. The diffuser cover is a bit fussy to get on, but it s really not an issue. 
8082 This innocent looking motion detector is fantastic. Picture quality is great. No one should notice their real purpose of video surveillance. 
8083 Great for macro. Used it to take closeup shots of eyes. 
8084 Awesome charger and batteries. I have the hero 4 black and these batteries work perfect and just as well as the one that came with the camera. The charger charges all 3 at once no problem. Or just 1 or 2 whatever your needs are. Highly reccomend! 
8085 Very easy setup and use. Good picture quality. Very happy with my purchase. 
8086 Nice 
8087 Great batteries to get for great price but those batteries drain little faster than original go pro hero battery. 4.5/5 
8088 ended up selling this on craigslist. kept locking up and overheating. made a great doorstop. 
8089 Love it! Some of the menu options are a bit hard to understand, and the included manual isn t very helpful, but luckily there are tons of tutorials about every feature online! 
8090 Love this works great! 
8091 I love Canons. Been using them for years. Love the rebel series. This was/is my first camcorder and got it for family funtions. Great quality!! So compact and ships to you fast! 
8092 I bought it for my daughter to play with. The pictures are blurry & grainy. 
8093 Perfect fit 
8094 Purchased a bunch of these. Really super! Love the new insert to give the &#34;v&#34; groove an option to be flat. Got to see it to understand. 
8095 Have not had to use it but glad I purchased it. 
8096 Very nice pouch s for my lens.Made very well and looks great too!Well worth the money to protect your valuable lens. 
8097 Great product 
8098 Great lens. Sharp and cheap! 
8099 Perfect size for X100T--but be careful to order the right one from the pull-down menu Installation was easy with no lint or bubbles, and it was even fun thanks to the humorous instructions. 
8100 I am sorry I cannot give a review as that item was ordered erroneously and returned. 
8101 I just love this camera, ease of use, takes great pictures and video. 
8102 very limited usefulness. i threw mine away immediately. 
8103 Works perfectly for my go pro and my Sony 4k actioncam Get one. You ll love it 
8104 Very good 
8105 Extremely clear and bright view. I use this for terrestrial viewing of the beach and mountains and it works amazingly well. I can also see the rings of Saturn with this! This model was a huge upgrade over the entry level Celestron 100mm spotting scope. 
8106 Lot s of light for the buck. Still not as user friendly as LED light panels. The green screen is thinner than what i expected and it doesn t all fit into the bag. Give your self lots of time to set up for interview and you should be good. 
8107 Quick delivery and great product! 
8108 Good camera 
8109 Great. Just wished the voice and speaker sound was better. 
8110 I had to return right away. Broken right out of the box and VERY flimsy. The neck screw to loosen or tighten the legs was broken as well as one of the legs would not lock into place for the bottom section. 
8111 Description said 30 LED would light up, as shown in the picture. The ones received only have one blinking red light. Disappointed in the description. 
8112 Nice! good Build quality. 
8113 Perfect... 
8114 Thanks 
8115 worked as advertised. the European adapter is a nice plus. 
8116 This tripod is a great value. It is of much higher quality than I was expecting for the price. I bought it to use with my spotting scope and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a low profile tripod to use on your shooting bench. 
8117 Fast shipping and exactly as described 
8118 Batteries were a perfect addition for my camera. Product as described and love that there is a travel charger included since we re doing a good amount of traveling around Hawaii taking pictures. 
8119 Met my needs. Great shipping. 
8120 awesome gift for my hubby he loves it 
8121 Works well for what it is. A perfect fit for my SoTech Mission Go Bag. 
8122 It does what it suppose to do. 
8123 Gave me plenty of back up 
8124 Works very well. My inital use was to create slides for a presentation. Very happy with this camera. 
8125 Good tripod for studio work, but too bulky to carry in the field. 
8126 They work just fine. The charger isn t as good as the Panasonic charger, but it works. 
8127 Works great and fits perfectly 
8128 Great strap for my Fuji XPro1. Really don t use the bag. 
8129 Worked great. Nothings perfect, but it works. The stem that goes into battery insert in the camera, seems a little fragile. Handle with care. Overall, good product. Glad I purchased it, lasted a lot longer since I use my 70D for video. 
8130 Bought this to replace a lower resolution camera. When I hooked it up, the image was black and white and continually rolled. Sending it back. 
8131 Good deal 
8132 Great product. Easy to use and setup. 
8133 Good 
8134 I bought this a while ago, it is still holding a good charge. I have noticed no difference in this vs the Nikon. 
8135 Great image quality. You lose one stop but it does a wonderful/clear job extending the range of the lens. 
8136 Great macro lens and rounds out a nice set of lens offerings for the e-Mount/A7 series of Sony camera bodies. 
8137 Gives you an excellent view with 2x magnification. 
8138 Doesn t fit the GoPro 4 
8139 I received the go pro lcd + for Father s Day I purchased this after some legwork on Amazon I am very happy with this product and feel confident that my gopro will remain safe and secure even though this is not an exact fit for it 
8140 Great little camera. It takes great pictures at night and in low light setting too. 
8141 As advertised, on time, works great. 
8142 Warning. My Wasabi charger died after approximately one year. The battery works ok. 
8143 Package arrived on time and the product is as described. It fits my Cannon 450D. 
8144 Works perfectly on my Canon FD 85mm f/1.2 and my Sony A7II. No movement, looks great, and works perfectly! I like to leave the adapters obn the lenses, so I will have to buy another one for my other FD lens. 
8145 This binocular has excellent vision. 
8146 Great quality batteries. Got these for my gopro hero 4 and they work great. Just as good quality as the gopro batteries at about half the price. Great buy 
8147 This is a fabulous product! 
8148 The camera is very good. Easy to operate and takes great pics. The added accessory is junk. 
8149 It does not fit my 4 Silver. 
8150 Just your normal battery charger. Nothing exciting. 
8151 Great lens, quality as expected. Great shipper! 
8152 I have purchased six Yongnuo flash units in the past and was completely satisfies that I got my monies worth. This is the first unit that I m dissatisfied with. 
8153 LOVE! This will probably be my new favorite lens on my D5300!! Excellent photo quality! 
8154 Almost all you need to work with an action camera 
8155 I have had this replaced three times in the past week. None of them work. Two of the batteries warped upon first use. CHEAPEST PRODUCT EVER DO NOT BUY 
8156 Perfect. 
8157 I will be in Nepal for 5 weeks trekking and I want enough battery life for my camera. I wish there was a USB charger. 
8158 i have used mine for the last ski season on my helmet, am very happy with it. but buy fast sdmc chip for it( high transfer rate) and it works great. Heck of a deal with all the accessories. Isn t a gopro but it also isn t $400 
8159 The picture quality is great and the supplied software is easy to use 
8160 Loved the camera, accessories where a waste: oversized bag and tripod the holder for the SDs , etc ... prefer accessories that match the product like smaller case, helmet or wrist mounts, etc 
8161 like very much 
8162 Software for remote viewing frequently stops streaming regardless of signal strength or connection method. Disappointing. 
8163 PERFECT and so affordable for such a quality item... THANKS, J 
8164 Good little ball head. Nothing amazing, but it works and it s a good deal. 
8165 This is not worth the money I spent on it and will be sending it back I and very disappointed with this 
8166 Really improved shooting and composing ease but it s just too bulky to fit with the tripod carrying bag. 
8167 For some vacation, I do need a affordable and waterproof camera 
8168 This is everything I need to have a great time with a gopro. Awesome kit 
8169 That was a funny time. 
8170 Good Batteries, better than other brands with higher amp hour. 
8171 Prints really clear 
8172 Affordable, works, what more can you say! 
8173 Solid estructure, very large. Easy to fold and light to carry 
8174 Great case for the price why waste your money on a name brand one. 
8175 Use it twice never damaged it but it started shutting off by itself I guess the product had it defects 
8176 Looks ok 
8177 The description should be changed. You cannot get film for this camera. It is useless ! Do not buy! If you want to look at it or collect them then but it. If you want to use it you are out of luck! 
8178 These work as stated but if you use large CFL bulbs for photography you need to take caution when screwing them in. The sockets are barely strong enough to support the weight of such larger bulbs. 
8179 Easy to install. Easy on and off. Good product 
8180 it makes good pictures 
8181 yes 
8182 The camera its self is great. Great picture and clarity. But the mounting bracket is cheap and doesn t hold the camera, it falls off all the time and even with the instructions it hard to navigate through the setting. 
8183 Compact, easy to use, has extra features, and takes great pictures. 
8184 It is exactly what I ordered and what I expected 
8185 Works as a recorder and video. Hard to tell if it s on or off and no way to tell &#34;what&#34; part of the item being video d is being recorded - for example if you want to record someones face, there s no way to tell if you are. 
8186 I love my camera, I m enjoying taking pictures and learning how to use it to get the best quality. 
8187 Good for people like to do some sport or some movie free to move 
8188 Great tools, it has everything that I need in cleaning my SLR. I m also impressed with the fast delivery. 
8189 ok 
8190 works as planed 
8191 https://youtu.be/2uKrjo2SMuA 
8192 Excellent kit, camera takes very clear pictures and works as intended. Great Value. 
8193 Great product!!!! 
8194 These photography reflectors are awesome!!! I totally recommend them! 
8195 It s a great camera pictures are great even when all the way zoomed in they are still pretty good.In low light it s also good all of my low light pictures turn out good. 
8196 quality product, arrived quickly. 
8197 Exactly what I needed, much longer than the original which is helpful. 
8198 Great. 
8199 Excellent flash to use. 
8200 Extreemly good quality for the price. Almost as good as my Nikons that were twice the price. I would buy them just to have them in the car. 
8201 love it worked wonderfully to take family pictures with in combination with the Altura Photo E-TTL Flash Kit for CANON DSLR 
8202 This replaced a crappy Walmart special. I m definitely happy with this. It is heavy, so don t plan on backpacking with it. That does make it nice and sturdy though. 
8203 Bought last year, was still in unopened package and installed last week. Waited because I was undergoing chemo. Replaced battery, doesn t work at all. After reading multiple other reviews where people received ones that never worked, I would give this item a -1 if I could. 
8204 A true 360ws strobe for this price is really a great deal. I tested it and got F22 at 10 , 100ISO...that s a GN of 220 measured in feet.... !!!! I have used it a few times and so far it s held up very well. 
8205 This kit is really great!! It makes my pics much focused and wider. The fisheye lens is awesome for panoramic photos. 
8206 hoping for aluminum ! 
8207 Outstanding quality and function with nice rubber grip and very useful water tight space to store things such as thumbscrews or other GoPro parts. Overall it is a very nice, high quality bobber and worth the small additional cost to gain a better design and useful compartment. 
8208 ok 
8209 Great product. 
8210 I purchased these to use while snorkeling & kayaking. They fit perfectly on disposable waterproof cameras, were comfortable on my wrists and kept the camera afloat when it bounced out of the kayak. 
8211 perfect as described 
8212 Worked great on a BIG Lab!! 
8213 I bought this camera as a beginner camera for me. I love and and am still learning. 
8214 Not hard to use at all, simple entry level light meter. This was a great purchase for a photography student like myself, and it fits nicely into the camera bag which is always appreciated. 
8215 Martin Powell THIS TECH WAS GREAT UNDERSTOOD HIM. HELP ME OUT ALL THE WAY. I APPRECIATE IT. IRWIN 
8216 Received on time as promised and I feel this cap will last longer (not get lost) because of the strap attached to the cap 
8217 Really great design. Changes the look of the Sony A7. Usually gets lots of compliments 
8218 Works great. Fast delivery 
8219 Great buy, versatile, small, but not too, and I use it in the classroom and it is great 
8220 The battery and the travel charger are NOT FOR THIS CAMERA! The charger clearly says for a NIKON and the battery is the WRONG SIZE! Do not waste teh extra $20 thinking you are getting a good deal, You are better off buying the extra battery and travel charger elsewhere. 
8221 A perfect match and fit. I am very happy with the purchase 
8222 I am happy with this purchase, !!! 
8223 Great case for the money. Refill foam is available, which is great if you change your usage. Solid hard case. 
8224 Works great 
8225 Haven t been able to use it as it is missing the top bracket 
8226 Pricey, but works as designed and does a great job. 
8227 Extremely affordable and you can fit two light for night time shooting. 
8228 as advertised, no issues with quality or performance 
8229 This is invaluable for setting up a variable focus camera, while you re up on a ladder. It s self-contained and straps to your wrist, and even provides power to the camera so you can view exactly what the camera sees, before you finalize placement. 
8230 I am not real enthusiastic about the picture quality. The picture will jump for days on in and then finally stop. Get what you pay for I guess 
8231 Great filter for the price! 
8232 For the money it can t be beat, purchased as a spare to my Canon 430 speedlite, limited in someways but a great backup and came in quick, just before my vacation. 
8233 Really great lights if you are starting out with portrait photography. Great price and they work great. 
8234 product is great but delivery by USPS leave a lot to be desired 
8235 Correct part and on time delivery 
8236 As advertised. Well worth buying refurbished. 
8237 Well made. Reasonably priced 
8238 This is a great sports cam for the price! Have used it while riding ATV s and in the pool! Takes great pictures and the video is great! Highly recommend this camera! 
8239 Great value! Everything works amazingly well for the price. 
8240 Very close to OEM batteries, holding a good charge for a reasonable time. 
8241 asdf 
8242 Works as expected 
8243 Worked very well for gift to elderly parents. All they have to do is sit back and watch the photos. Only lacking star as user interface is clunky. And no notification provided to new account that can add photos by email 
8244 Works great with my camera! 
8245 Love this.. Also purchased the Canopy 2 year protection plan. I just need to know how to get replacement parts. The 4 things on each corner..? Already lost 2 in trees. 
8246 Amazing! 
8247 Love it 
8248 Works good. It could use a better manual. 
8249 I am very satisfied with my foscam f19831p. Calls to the support line for setup help has been easy and kenneth is nice and very knowledgeable which made setup very easy. 
8250 EXCELLENT...much better than another selfie stick (more expensive) that i purchased last...I lost that one. The Volsey is sturdy, lighter, has rechargable battery and easier to use. Thumbs up!! 
8251 Such a wonderful equipment bag. Love the size -- fits under the economy class seat of a 737 (at least it did for me). Great for European travel where they always weigh your carry-on... they don t ask much about this one. 
8252 Wife loves this camera. It can make anybody look like a pro. 
8253 Just what I needed to protect my new lens! Thanks! 
8254 gift 
8255 Excellent item, very quick to post, Thanks 
8256 It s ok 
8257 Just like the original one. Right fit and right feel. 
8258 I ordered 1 pair these I think came from California. ..and the were garbage. Very poorly made and didn t last long at all ....the part that came from China was very well made and had a locking ring and screw .... 
8259 Cheaply built, sound quality was extremely poor, and I could barely hear the sound. Would not recommend. 
8260 Great kit. 
8261 Great deal!!!! 
8262 Sorry, but this was a piece of junk. It s cheap plastic like a table cloth from the dollar store. It came crushed and wrinkled and I was never able to get the wrinkles out in order to use it. 
8263 Excellent quality. Use it to keep my b&w 120 film. 
8264 Great!! Product I love this camara, I show the camara to one of my friends and like it and he got one to... 
8265 Works best for skin response. 
8266 Works fine but instructions are hard to understand. .and even locate oniine.. 
8267 It s so nice to have this and it works pretty good. My only complaint is that the range isn t very far so it defeats the purpose of using it. 
8268 Camera uses unusual means of releasing the shutter. There is a ring outboard of the zoom ring, that must be pressed just right to release the shutter. My technicians had great difficulty getting the shutter to release on several occasions. 
8269 Far too overpriced 
8270 Haven t had this much fun since i bought my first motorcycle. Love this thing, easy to fly, almost addictive. 
8271 Super 
8272 Excellent value. 
8273 I used this camera and the quality is really good. I would definitely recommend this 
8274 Really love this bag. The sections in it are so helpful! 
8275 Got this as a present for a friend! She said the pictures may come out dark in too much sunlight 
8276 Great Product 
8277 Got this for a customer who misplaced their older-style / 1st generation USB cable to download photos from camera. Works as advertised. 
8278 Great series of reflectors. I love the shear scrim. Caveat: Almost impossible to fold up. Really! 
8279 Small form factor but great performance. Always missed out on a flash for fuji for covering small functions. 
8280 Great gift I gave my dad. The only thing is the tripod is a bit smaller than expected. Like that every fits in the case! 
8281 Great lights for close up filming and they work really well in low light outdoor areas. However you must make sure your camcorder matches with this brand of lights because it comes with a shoe mount you need to screw into specific sony model cameras. 
8282 I use my camera every weekend and did not notice that this shield was even on. Easy application and does not distort the screen. 
8283 had to write a review.... camera is fantastic! really easy to set up... great job 
8284 Good, thanks so much 
8285 have not realy used yet but what I did try worked fine 
8286 I just got the chance to try it right now. it is cheap material product, it s broke right away. 
8287 Solid Construction, threads very easily on several different lenses, from L series to non L glass. Perfect amount of drag on the rotation of the filter. eliminates guesswork. Color Cast?? NONE I could find. Solid piece of gear. Has replaced my Tiffen CPLs for good! 
8288 Batteries delivered very quickly and as described. Work well in my Nikon D5200 camera. Price was great for two. 
8289 very nice to replace all the adapters into one unit. 
8290 This is not working after a week! 
8291 Very nice and tidy, fits well for sony nex 
8292 Used for over 5000 pictures in two weeks. Worked great on my RX100iii. 
8293 Used to complete my camera system 
8294 worked great until transmitter went bad 
8295 Fit perfect and git fast 
8296 Received cables in a timely manner ( thank you ) replaced it with my 4 camera splitter and have no problems still. 
8297 Good and fast delivery and the productWorks and looks good 
8298 Was delivered when they said it would be lots of extras for a great price 
8299 *** Star 
8300 Works great. No problem with filters either... even a polarizer. 
8301 It s very good 
8302 This item is really great, and a good value! 
8303 love the space 
8304 perfect size. Tight to work with, getting in and out. stiff zipper. hope it will soften with use. 
8305 Excellent Tripod! ! Would always buy it again. Next time I would get the taller tripod So sturdy. It does anything. Love it! 
8306 Good for the price. Quality are beyond expectation. 
8307 no tan bueno 
8308 It does exactly what is suppose to, not to mention it s pretty sleek. 
8309 Everything was just fine!! Charged batteries & tested perfect In my S50 Cannon camera!! 
8310 One camera was missing the antenna 
8311 Works well, no humming, good for multiple long exposures 
8312 Gave this a bday gift and daughter loves it. A bit pricey having to constantly purchase film but it s to be expected. Nice shade of blue and works exactly as it should. 
8313 Working fine. 
8314 Accidentally threw out the original charger for my camera so I had to buy this one. It works well so far. 
8315 While it is cheaper that the Nikon version, and has an internal battery which is nice, it is bulky. 
8316 I m a big Rokinon fan as I own the 85mm and the 135mm. This is probably the worse glass I ve ever owned. 
8317 It s a Micro USB charger. Nothing more. 
8318 Worked well! 
8319 Amazing! So many possibilities. 
8320 2nd one I bought. I think the bag that it comes in has gotten a little better quality 
8321 really its exellent and the photo very sharp 
8322 thanks alot for 
8323 Yep, they re batteries. Work as advertised, and last longer than the one that came with the Fuji X100T. 
8324 Great concept, but it wouldn t velcro around my hands any way i tried. I may have had a defective one but i had to return it. Seemed like the velcro was in the wrong place. 
8325 These are adequate. Not as thin as the better pieces, but does the job. Good value. 
8326 It s great! up to now I have used it 3 times, with no issue. easy to connect and install. 
8327 The harness broke tge first time we put it on. Cheap! 
8328 great starter kit 
8329 Awesome kit for my Nikon D3100! Arrived quickly and already having fun with this kit and my new lense! Allows everyday people to take more professional shots with any camera! Very happy with this purchase! 
8330 Poor optical quality. Lot of purple fringing and image softness. Heavy and prone to lot of image shake due to high magnification.Returned and would not buy again. 
8331 junk 
8332 Item came in well protected and completely new. It was adequate for me to keep my dive mask and offer really good protection to my mask 
8333 They have great instructional videos n the product is easy to manipulate however, due to flimsy materials used it does not function as advertised. Expected stronger parts...seems like a $25 product instead. 
8334 Awesome Unit. Not phantom so only use with your powered mics before going into camera. 
8335 It is not what I expected but my granddaughter is having fun using them 
8336 Its totally working for me. Charging my D90 Battery like a charm. 
8337 Klugy, but it works. 
8338 Good stuff at a reasonable price. 
8339 The flip up eye piece is what makes this camera worth having. An absolute must for outdoor sunny days, and while zooming in on far away objects. 
8340 Perfect 
8341 Received broken. Very cheap quality. Is more a toy. 
8342 This was everything I expected and more. Absolutely love it.. 
8343 Good camera and even though it was refurbished it is in great condition. 
8344 Almost all the photos I took came out blurry, and I did follow the directions and made sure I was within 3 feet of the subject, etc. Disappointed. 
8345 This camera is better than my friend s GoPro! After I showed him my camera, he got one as well. 
8346 This camera has a nice clear picture. 
8347 You can never have too many mounts for your Go Pro. 
8348 lots of room fits canon t3 , 75-250, 35-55 lens, extra batteries, cone, point and shot, flash, lots more room 
8349 Nice 
8350 Works well 
8351 I have used this camera for the last 3 weeks in a Swimming Pool and at the Sea and It works great!! 
8352 Speedy delivery is always a plus and can I use the same UV filter on the zoom (300mm), part of my camera also? I am very happy with this one, easy for this lady who loves taking her action pix. Thank you 
8353 I love this! 
8354 Unfortunately there was something wrong with the camcorder upon arrival. We got in touch with Vivitar and they replaced it with a newer model. Great customer support! 
8355 Great stuff. 
8356 Use it only a few times.Hands should be steady to get clear pictures. 
8357 Best $$ I ever spent. This is really a good product. I was in Bermuda recently and I was able to take a lot of beautiful pictures under the sea!! I love it. I used it for my Canon Powershot S95. 
8358 Does the job but you have to tighten really hard so it does not come out and wiggle loose.. Good grip and cheap for the cost. Shipping came in whenever it wanted. It said 3-4 weeks but it came in 1.5 weeks without warning. Just showed up... haha China, man... 
8359 Love this lens and is on my camera most of the time. I particularly like the constant bigger f number in this lens. 
8360 Works but did not impress me too much...makes hardly a change in the picture 
8361 This thing is so sweet! Very agile, quick, and reaponsive. This puppy is so fun to fly! A great quad to learn the basics with. 
8362 I like it! 
8363 great value, works as advertised 
8364 So handy! 
8365 Helps extend recording time on the device without too much added mass. The small batteries in the GoPro Hero 4 are a joke so you really need to get this if you are planning to record for any length of time. 
8366 Good bundle. 
8367 Good Camera 
8368 Great buy 
8369 great 
8370 Works excellent. Fits perfectly on an HO flat car to make videos on model railroad as if riding on train. 
8371 Thanks everything was good!!! 
8372 We are very pleased and may buy another of the same. 
8373 Last a little longer than the stock battery. 
8374 it s very nice 
8375 An amazingly versatile lens. Easy to use in just about any situation. I ve only just scratched the surface of its capabilities and not come close to its limits. Except when I m going super-wide (and then I love my 10-24), this sits on the camera (70D) 
8376 Where can I get info on how to program this device? 
8377 Fits perfect, light and strong material. 
8378 Camera fits great in it and with the padding it stays safe! 
8379 Its a lenshood - not much function :-). It has a quality feel. 
8380 Perfect kit for maintaining lenses. Magic fiber is really nice for cleaning all glass 
8381 very good camera, installed and work better than the others, have purchsed more. 
8382 Product has met my expectations and great quality for such an affordable price! Package came in great condition and received it in 2 days. Very satisfied with their services. 
8383 Excellent 
8384 Charger works with my Canon T1i battery. Came in a small box and looks like the charger pictured. Haven t tried to use it in the car, but that should be a nice option. 
8385 Great camera. Easy to install, good quality and small enough to hide when needed. Great product! 
8386 Pretty good camera! 
8387 Did not work on my Canon Flash. 
8388 Best value for the money. 
8389 After doing a boatload of research on rear view cameras I decided to purchase the rear view safety camera. It has lived up to its reputation. Installation was a snap and I couldn t be happier with the performance. 
8390 The neck broke on the second use... Very cheap plastic. 
8391 Very sharp, very good quality. Great build quality. I would say much better than the Canon alternative. 
8392 Make sure to get the extra batteries as just having one in there is a waste. It adds bulk but feels good in the hand when flipping for a portrait shot. Its worth paying a little bit more for the official Canon grip instead of the other branded ones. 
8393 Works great! no issues with battery life after 3 weeks 
8394 Just love the product, worked out great. A+++ 
8395 This product is not as it appears in the ad. It is an ordinary, round mirror; so don t imagine an oval that fits our small, rear view mirrors. Fooled me with the picture. If you want a little, round mirror, shop locally. 
8396 Carl was VERY helpful in assisting me in activating my FOSCAM camera. Thank you. 
8397 Worked perfect, good quality 
8398 works 
8399 I love this bag. Well made. 
8400 Arrived in ecellent condition. 
8401 Great price.....fits well. 
8402 I didn t go through all of it s features. My Samsung phone takes less grainy photos. The zoom was the only advantage, and wasn t worth the extra expense. If I want zoom, I ll buy a film camera. 
8403 Works great with my Flash unit and is very adaptable to my needs: However, After only two uses the tension in the umbrella caused two of the prongs to bend. Though the everything works, the umbrella is slightly off and is no longer symmetric. 
8404 Excellent tripod and holder. 
8405 Great price. 
8406 I love bringing this camera when I go to Disney! The pictures come out so good! I recommend taking outdoor shots when the sky is clear for a more &#34;enhanced&#34; shot. 
8407 The t5i is a great camera. Nice features and no issues with it yet. I bought the bundle primarily for the extra lens and included SD card. The case, tripod, wide angle lens, and filters are passable but not great. The value of this set is worth the price. 
8408 The sling shoulder neck strap makes it much easier to pull the camera into position. It realigns the pressure points away from the neck spine and reduces pressure on the muscles of the neck. This is especially helpful for photographers with arthritic spinal changes associated with aging. 
8409 Great device. Easy to install and even easier to use. Just set it and forget it. Very good quality pics. 
8410 I love this camera!!! Exactly what I wanted! The night vision is so clear and I love being able to move the camera by touching the screen of the device I m using. 
8411 Good item. Sturdy. Worth every money you paid for. 
8412 Very light and powerful. Worked well in Alaska 
8413 Charger didn t last a week and batteries won t keep a charGe 
8414 wouldn t recommend due to vignetting showing up on videos. 
8415 Very good video! 
8416 These are beautiful original DJI Props. these are not the cheap knockoffs from other listings. you get what you pay for .Make sure if you are flying you are using OEM parts to guarantee you don t crash your quad from inferior parts. 
8417 Fits perfectly. Perfection in workmanship and material. All greatness! 
8418 Great camera and user friendly....takes great pictures 
8419 perfect gift for birthday give along with new insant camera. 
8420 Great deal for me-use for astronomy and birding. Field of view is a little narrow but that s to be expected compared to the Fuji 10x50 s and Pentax 7x50 s I use also. Good colors and it s made in Japan too. 
8421 Camera works great, arrived on time and as advertised, the lens on this camera is so much better than my last digital camera. 
8422 Awesome product,quick delivery, and great support 
8423 It work perfectly. I Hava bought other kid of before but definitely this one for much is the best. I love it. 
8424 I totally love these lights. Nice and bright and the ability to manipulate between incandescent and daylight gives a creator loads of options for setting up a shot. 
8425 I have to return them because it was impossible for me to contact customer services. Even though it was easy to install it, there were steps I needed to be guided through, and I couldn t get the help to go through it. 
8426 It works well for the money. The charge was a little less than I had hoped for. 
8427 Love it thank youuuu 
8428 I ve had no problems with the batteries or the charger. This should be standard for any GoPro user. Highly recommend. 
8429 Works perfectly to replace sensors zapped by lightning. Easy to install. 
8430 Fairly good for the price! Sometimes it takes a little bit to take the pictures but then once it finally connects works good! Perfect for a beginner. 
8431 Good products 
8432 I did not receive a Kodak battery. I received a Halcyon battery, which would not recharge. Since I ve misplaced the receipt, I can t return it. I have purchased a Radio Shack battery instead of trying to order one again. 
8433 Mounts and works very well 
8434 Excellent photo quality. Excellent build and feel. Excellent WiFi features. I bought this primarily to take pictures of Coins and it definitely took some outstanding pictures. WiFi Direct Transfer to PC was a breeze. Saved me a fortune of time. 
8435 Product works as advertised. 
8436 everything was ok. Thank you! 
8437 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0ay8zAY_Jw This is how we used it and it worked great for us I love everything about it and it is so durable and easy to work with. 
8438 This camera is exceptional. It is very similar to my GoPro, for a fraction of the price. I would highly recommend this cost effective alternative, especially if you are investing in a GoPro like device for the first time. 
8439 The ad claims that the fp100c works in the SX70 camera but the plastic case is too large to fit in the camera. 
8440 Perfect product, great price. Not too big to take on outings and it is durable. Plenty of storage. Highly recommended! 
8441 Excelente cámara ..delivery rapido 
8442 good 
8443 Very comfortable for extended use. Quality is very good. 
8444 I like the handle best, because it does float. The handle allows you to properly aim and shoot shots in all conditions. 
8445 This little camera is amazing for the money! very easy to use and has awsome picture quality! 
8446 Solid build quality and protected all my gear after falling out of a car! 
8447 I love the product! 
8448 Great product. Works great 
8449 Works well for carrying our Sony HandyCam and accessories. Not a lot of extra room, but probably enough. Seems to be quality-made and should last. 
8450 in day time is perfect but in night cant see anything i not return because is really difficult take it off but i don t recommend to no body 
8451 Item arrived on time. I m happy with this product 
8452 Battery works great! Fraction of the cost from Manufacturer. 
8453 Hi,thanks for sending to me the thing that i ordered,i love it./. 
8454 Meets all expectations 
8455 I returned this item as it does what it says but there is noticeable signal loss and distortion. 
8456 Worked as a perfect replacement battery for my Cannon Vixia HF R10 digital camcorder. Have been using for about 6 months and the battery has kept a charge way better than the battery that came with the camera. I recommend. 
8457 I couldn t be happier with this telescope. it is my first ever telescope, and i have had many amazing nights on my back porch with this thing. 
8458 I ll prefer regular foam over this stuff next time. But, overall this is pretty decent foam far as quality. 
8459 Very good softbox, great price! 
8460 👍 
8461 Battery dead in 45 min. 
8462 Lowepro makes the best lens cases around. I have this case in several different sizes. Not only do they protect the lens like no other, but they also look and feel great too. 
8463 This little stand does the trick. I have used it several time to give presentations to the Rotary Club. 
8464 Really bright light and goes right on my tripod with ease 
8465 This selfie stick is really nice but it broke on me the third time I used it. The middle piece broke off and I could not salvage it and had to throw it away. It also took the longest time to sync with my iPhone. 
8466 I ordered this lens hood for use with my macro lens. Works great. Be sure to check the thread size of the lens you would like to use it with before ordering. I ordered the 49 mm thread size and it fits my lens perfectly. 
8467 Works perfectly, just what I needed 
8468 Works fantastic. Couldn t find locally and wanted it for vacation! Solution? Order thru Amazon and it ll be there when you get there!! &#60;3. #dottiedixon 
8469 Product was just as discribed 
8470 Great service and prompt delivery! Thanks a bunch!! A+ 
8471 Sturdy doors with secure latch. Just right for making access to space under RV dinette seats. The only improvement I suggest is to include a template with it for cutting the hole. 
8472 I just got a Canon G3-X with external EVF, and I needed a case that would fit it. This one works perfectly, plus there is room in the front packet for the charger and other accessories. Great case! 
8473 ITS OK 
8474 Magic fiber is amazing at cleaning glass. I keep some in my car, my husbands car, my camera bag, my desk office. It s so handy 
8475 Excellent product. I lost my original Sony charger along with the original battery. This is quite an excellent replacement. Feels like it charges much quicker than the original charger. The cigarette lighter charger comes in really handy. Overall, very satisfied. 
8476 Great value for a set of four. My SIL loves her little polaroid and this film is really cute. I would buy this for her again. 
8477 Amazing fit 
8478 Hoy glass is top notch. If you re a pro, and you re using high quality lenses, don t put a plastic filter over them and soften up your image. Just bite the bullet, spend the extra money, and get a filter you can be proud of. 
8479 Works as intended. Love the colors, hard to miss! 
8480 decent 
8481 EXCELENTE 
8482 Makes charging quick and easy. 
8483 High quality product in individual plastic envelopes. Excellent performance. Couldn t be happier. 
8484 This copter is so light when it crashes nothing happens. It is loads of fun and easy to fly 
8485 Love it! Works great at a great price. 
8486 Need to firmly tight...even after tight...it gets loose...so need to find the right position to place this arm and supporting device... 
8487 Very handy and everything I expected. 
8488 Excellent 
8489 parts where missing 
8490 I love it but its not water proof 
8491 I have a small camera that I travel with and it fits in this case very snugly. It seems to be enough protection while in my luggage, from clanging into other hard surfaces. 
8492 Just as advertised. Everything was brand new in its original packaging and it all works properly. 
8493 Nice 
8494 I ve learned a lot about my camera. 
8495 As expected 
8496 awesome item 
8497 The photos are very clear and sharp - excellent lens. 
8498 as described... work well 
8499 Very nice camera, but needed a memory card. This was a separate purchase and delayed camera use. 
8500 Arrived on time and everything was in great condition. The lens and flash just didn t work for me. 
8501 Just an FYI: I checked each item in the package to see what each would cost separately. I only searched on Amazon. The total came to $1297 - without the bag; the description here is too vague to match it. 
8502 Nice 
8503 really GOOD DVR FOR THIS MONEY 
8504 Love love love this!!! Nice price, great product, easy to use. 
8505 I love the camera but it is missing a very important attachment piece. I can t use any attachments because one screw is missing. 
8506 As long as you re on a flat surface it works perfectly. I wouldn t recommend usage on carpet or any rough terrain. 
8507 Great deal..look very professional. 
8508 great deal, not sure why so many others are selling the same kit for $50 more, oh well 
8509 Only thing is I thought it would be assorted but they are all one design. 
8510 Love love love!!! 
8511 B 
8512 Good price, I think the quality of the picture are fair. I was very happy with the results. 
8513 Nice 
8514 Bought this for my new Canon camera. Hold a charge well. 
8515 Absolutely love this and for the price and all I will have to do is remember to take batteries! 
8516 Operates as described and expected. Excellent zoom. 
8517 Seller was very good to work with. I was very pleased with my purchase. 
8518 I like it 
8519 Comfortable sturdy strap but hard to get used to how my camera hangs. 
8520 Did what I bought it for 
8521 This seems to work as good as the original that came with the Nikon 1. It is quite compact and came quickly when we forgot our original charger on a trip. 
8522 They worked great and even lasted longer then the go pro battery! 
8523 Just what I needed and a great price 
8524 Bought this to use with my Nikon D5500 DSLR. Works perfect! 
8525 Well made, comfortable on the wrist. Detachable clip makes this even handier. Love the design too. I ve also been using Optech s larger model wrist strap on my Mirrorless Fuji X-T1 on three trips, and their products are very well made and the most comfortable straps around. 
8526 Well made and works perfectly. 
8527 Works ok. But will not connect to wifi 
8528 great product 
8529 Has a defect. A line straight across. I ll keep it only because I got it on a great deal. 
8530 Great camera but far too complicated for a 73 year old man such as me. 
8531 VERY GOOD 
8532 Item delivered on time, was as described and a very nice product, packed good would rate A+ all the way ! 
8533 Great addition to adjust white balance which everyone should know how to do. Folds nicely to fit in any bag. 
8534 Love it, takes great pics. 
8535 Nice mount fits the camera perfectly. 
8536 great. 
8537 Great camera case! I love the color (brown leather). It is so fashionable. 
8538 I lost my original lens cap somewhere in Yosemite! This is exactly like my original and I received it quickly. 
8539 good 
8540 Don t waste your money on this battery grip for the Sony a6000. It is a piece of junk. 
8541 I have not found a better charger for the price n 
8542 The adapter ring does not come with the filter retaining ring so another adapter ring has to be used to hold the filter on the camera lens. It holds the filter on the camera lens as per it s purpose. 
8543 It s just a not good product. It s cheap to the touch. 
8544 Perfect accessory for any lense 
8545 I love this lens. Fast shipment. Thanks 
8546 Great 
8547 I ve tried this out alot and i really like it. the quality is really nice , both the 720p and 1080p. Learning how to use it is incredibly easy and painless. I got this is as a promotion for a review. 
8548 I like the item but when I received it and tried putting it together, the stick will not screw into the part that holds the phone. I cannot use this item. 
8549 What a joke! No way to save your videos to a PC. The only option is to use THEIR cloud storage for $99/year MORE! No thanks as they SHOULD allow US to save OUR videos! JOKE RIP OFF PRODUCT!!! 
8550 Reasonably priced, items as described, arrived when promised. Seller recommended. 
8551 The instructions are terrible. We still can t figure how to make it work!! 
8552 This is just awesome! I will definitely recommend it! Very satisfied :-) 
8553 Used this mount to record a few videos while I was driving and it did a really good job. It s solid and worked great on the dashboard and the windshield. If you re looking to make mobile videos, don t look past this mount. 
8554 My mother in law requested this for her birthday to store her new Nikon camera and all of its accouterments. It holds everything and is a reasonable size. Plus, the backpack style is much easier to tote around than the shoulder strap version of old. 
8555 Everything works well. There are a few places some of the plastic fittings aren t perfectly smooth, but you re paying $25 for a ton of parts. 
8556 Works perfect 
8557 I am loving this camera!! I got this to upgrade from my T2i and I am very impressed. Pictures are really clear and great. The camera is bigger but I m getting used to it. I am very happy I went with this one. :) 
8558 Products are the same quality as the originals. However, these come at a very affordable price that everyone can afford. Wouldn t hesitate to buy again if i get another gopro. 
8559 pretty good camera 
8560 This was advertised a product with the Canon camera I purchased so I wrongly thought it would fit the camera and it doesn t. Much too small for the camera I bought so it is useless to me 
8561 Very cool for it to geotag the pictures taken. I love it! 
8562 The hood is OK. But when removing from camera it comes off together with the protective lens. 
8563 I really love my Rode VideoMic I shot a whole documentary using this microphone. I am thinking about upgrading to the pro anyone want to buy my gently used Mic?! Lol all jokes aside, this is a wonderful microphone and makes a big difference when you use it 
8564 Even though the original battery seems to last forever (next to no moving parts on the camera), it is always good to have a backup battery. This one is indistinguishable from the original battery, and works great. 
8565 I used the narrative to clip to capture moments with my family all over Japan and came back with many deeply satisfyingly memories that I couldn t have preserved any other way. 
8566 Best cheap LEDs 
8567 Excellent product - very pleased with it. 
8568 Love this camera backpack. Recommend it to everyone I meet. Perfect for traveling. 
8569 I use the MeFoto with my Canon 5D Mark III. Love it! (Fits nicely in my Packsack ) 
8570 Quite remarkable for the price. 
8571 very good day or night, also good price. this is my fourth dash cam .this one i like the best. but the question is, how long will it last? 
8572 It is excellent, 
8573 Life saver for me. Eliminated worries about my elderly mother getting out of bed at night with me knowing. 
8574 Perfect screen protection. Fits well and recommend you use it right out of the gate to protect the screen. 
8575 Meets my needs at the lowest price available. 
8576 From what I can tell, it is a real Fuji battery and powers the camera for the same length of time. We got this as a spare for when we are in the field for an extended period. Works fine. 
8577 excellent 
8578 Just as advertised 
8579 Lightweight, compact. Takes great pictures. 
8580 Battery 
8581 Does the job and great value for the price!! would recommend... 
8582 Very nice! just was what i needed. it is made well and works to keep all the parts in one place. thank you! 
8583 Doesn t seem very secure even as tight as possible. Getting a bit of shake from the joint on the clam shell to the arm. 
8584 The only problem was the host of extra charges that added over 15% to the first cost of $74.99 so that the total first cost to me was really $87.23. 
8585 The worse tripod I have seen. Too short, not strong, looks like kids tripod. I returned it. 
8586 The only complaint is that the lens hood is very loose. The lens is wide and sharp. 
8587 This case provides good protection for the camera. 
8588 works great 
8589 This camera meets & exceeds my expectations of a point & shoot camera. 
8590 Easy to use.. Just plug it into the wall.. Didnt ruin my battery. 
8591 Everything was good. 
8592 The camera worked ok but upon playback the colors were washed out, no matter what settings I had it on. Returned 
8593 I agree. Not plug and play. And even after figuring out the setup I never could get my NVR to recognize it. 
8594 the Falcon works fine I m very satisfied with this product 
8595 GOOD PRODUCT ! 
8596 muy bueno exelente 
8597 No heavy, easy to wear, nice. It great For the drome. 
8598 These work perfect for my small LED lights and Strobes. I have 6 of them and use them all the time :) 
8599 Nice. Handy size, neutral color, good texture for most any fine or delicate work. I m using it for guitar maintenance, but I may get another one for greasy/oily stuff, cars, bikes, guns; this is a handy product at a reasonable price. Beats using a yoga mat... 
8600 Definitely exceeds my expectations, this Nikon D5500 is a great camera, I am very happy, easy to handle specially for novice like me. 
8601 Happy with the product, does what I intended it to do! Love that you can string the cap to camera for easy impromptu photos! 
8602 Good 
8603 Simple to operate, easy to transport, the price was great. A good second camera to my SLR 
8604 Bought this for my Lumix DMC-GM5 camera and glad I did...grip is firm and secure and makes holding the camera that much more comfortable. My wife liked it so much she took it for her GM5...so now I have had to order a second one for myself!!! 
8605 very happy ...fast delivery...ready to use.. 
8606 Easy point and shoot, quality product. Gone are the days when I photographed with all Nikon film equipment. Easy to slip in your pocket and with a 32 gig memory stick you can take a years worth of pics. 
8607 Looks great on my mantle with 3 5x7 pictures from my granddaughter s wedding. I previously bought a similar frame that was too big for my space which was returned. This one shows off the pictures and is compact and beautifully made. 
8608 I have several Fotodiox adapters and they all fit perfectly, and so far they all allow focus to infinity. This one actually will focus past infinity. That isn t a big problem but you do have to actually focus at infinity. 
8609 Fits well, Looks good, Camera resolution NOT crisp. Prying out the old led bar and installing it in the camera unit was a little challenging. It gets the job done, and I like the position of the camera. If the image was more crisp it would be 4 stars easy. 
8610 Works great, easy to install 
8611 Did not work seems like not charged even after plugging in. 
8612 I purchased this and it works just fine. Found that I hardly use it though. 
8613 Great buy 
8614 Piece of junk! Battery lasts 10 minutes! Useless piece of equipment! Do not waste your money! 
8615 This lens had a bubble 
8616 Cant make a difference in photography, but looks defective. 
8617 good , fast shipping , that s great :) 
8618 They are for spares. 
8619 I loved this product bc it griped on my iPhone and did not fall.Aslo the selfie stick can adjust to your phone size. I have not seen no flaws yet.my rating is a five star. 
8620 If you re looking for a cheap tripod- well. here it is. Construction is a little flimsy, all plastic. It s alright but I d suggest just to have light loads on this one. 
8621 good film 
8622 very poor quality lens filter coloring on the glass was uneven when they arrived and the threads did not match up to the lens very well at all. 
8623 Good for a back-up. Not as well made as am original. But does work. 
8624 Excellent value, responsive and easy to fly. First drone I ve owned and will buy the XW8 FPV next. It s also great fun to do with you family. 
8625 Doesn t work. The gimbal catches 
8626 Love the quality of the pics and the range you get with this lens is amazing 
8627 Amazing. It has all I was looking for in a product like this. Very recommendable. 
8628 received as advertised but have not yet received my stand 
8629 AMAZING for the price. I mean it, you won t find a better reflector out there for this price 
8630 These work fine and the car charger is very convenient. However, they last about half as long as the original camera battery. It s not a big deal if you always have a spare fully charged battery, but carrying multiple batteries around on vacation gets tiresome. 
8631 Good quality, very relaible 
8632 Had a back room area in our office that frequently had staff during auto-arm times. This let the staff know the alarm was auto-arming. Easy to install. small form factor. very pleased. 
8633 It s a lens cap. Does what lens caps do! 
8634 It s a battery 
8635 We are using this camera everyday on our trip to Europe and it is easy to use and the pictures are wonderful. 
8636 Great product! Fast shipping!! 
8637 Stand was broken when I got it, completely useless 
8638 The mini usb port have 10 pins and doesn t work with most of the cameras. 
8639 Needed a cheap waterproof camera for vacation and this sufficed more than well enough. 
8640 excellent product, arrived on time, works great. i would purchase from this merchant again.very happy with this product, would recommend it to friends. 
8641 Great little lens. Used it a lot and it is made very well. 
8642 great camera for the price 
8643 Great seller, fast shipping, good product, thank you. 
8644 Works like a Nikon coolpix should 😏 
8645 With this I seldom need a lens cap. Works great. 
8646 Fine product fair price 
8647 Everything I expected! 
8648 Works great to replace original lens cap. 
8649 Came on time and intact. Very fast and power quadcopter. Will buy again. 
8650 I can t write about the function of the product except that I was not able to use it for my purpose. 
8651 Works Great! 
8652 Great easy to use 
8653 Makes a PEN into a pocket camera. 
8654 Fits pretty good. No hanging edges of the ends of the screen so the cover won t pill off easily. 
8655 Disappointed worked but didn t switch from day to night for reading plates had to climb post each morning and evening to change setting. Ended up buying different camera will find a use for this one somewhere else or resale 
8656 This was exactly what I needed and was afraid I would never find. Thanks!!! 
8657 Very nice ! 
8658 good quality and both the car and home chargers are handy. 
8659 The worst I have ever bought. 
8660 Nice worth the money would buy it again 
8661 Very Pleased with this item 
8662 Just what I needed the Nikon D5500 does not provide the Hot Shoe which is sad since you pay so much for the camera. 
8663 Works great with my Canon600EX 
8664 The pen is great, it takes clear pictures and great 720p videos. Over all a great pen. 
8665 I could never get the cameras to work while i was away from home. Hired professionals to connect the cameras -no luck. Planning on returning all items. 
8666 Has its tiny flaws, but does the job. 
8667 too bulky 
8668 Great quality - thank you! 
8669 gave as part of gift bag for someone with new Go Pro and they loved it! 
8670 Quick charging, great price, a little inconvenient that charger plugs directly into power point with no lead/cable, but great that you can also charge in the car. 
8671 Works as you would expect it to for a reasonable price 
8672 Great pictures but the video don t work good. 
8673 It is a good camera, nice pictures 
8674 great quality 
8675 It s a GoPro BacPac that as indicated gives you the extra time needed. Easily attaches the camera and extends the life almost twice of the battery. Fits perfectly into the extended housing and easily charged. I purchased two and glad that I did! 
8676 Charged up nice. No problems! 
8677 It is extremely convenient for me to be able to see the comings and goings of employees,lots of functions I`m interested in just like timely recording,motion detection alarm,night vision,PTZ curise etc. 
8678 we are trouble with Nest on the phone have to use pass word every time I want to see it 
8679 It is not user friendly for use. would like to talk to someone about it. please help. 
8680 working as intended 
8681 Really helps with underwater color. Stayed on the camera without a problem. Cotton safety string that catches lens in case the lens falls off the camera is flimsy and broke quickly. Will need to replace with nylon fishing line. 
8682 How do you love a charger? The merchandise is working fine. What I needed. 
8683 I had to return twice because two of the three lenses did not fit the camera. 
8684 Great to have spare; works great. 
8685 very good 
8686 good product 
8687 Camera is decent but the software is flat terrible....Sucks to setup and is also awful at motion detection.....It alerts for flies and bees but doesn t do anything with the person doing jumping jacks in my driveway. FAIL 
8688 I use this with a Vivitar 85mm 1.4 lens on my Sony A7ii. Works perfectly. I m getting another one for my 35mm manual focus lens just so I don t have to switch one out all the time. 
8689 Sick!! Works good 
8690 Fit perfectly. 
8691 We were able to see our home beautifully while on safari in South Africa - amazing! 
8692 Very bright! Love that you can change the warmth and the dial down the brightness. Takes a ton of batteries (AA), but to be expected. At full brightness, mine lasted about 2 hours. Great for fill light in photography. 
8693 Good quality 
8694 Sturdy and compact, everything I wished for. 
8695 Bought two for kayaking to keep cell phone in, they work great had for about a year now. 
8696 Works great. 
8697 Thanks 
8698 Arrived on time and is a good value. 
8699 It s a good starter to get you used to your GoPro and a lot of the accessories. Would definitely be considering upgrading after you have gotten use to them. 
8700 I love this camera. This package deal was a great starter kit. 
8701 Very visible on water and helps floating the camera its attached to. 
8702 Just what I wanted 
8703 Who need s a Gopro 
8704 Very good camera, it works great and very easy to learn to use. Takes very good pictures and it takes them fast. 
8705 Fits!!! 
8706 works well and secure all though sits a little low but works ok. Thanks! 
8707 It installs and operates quickly and without issues. The jumper to set the sensitivity is explained well. One thing I noticed, it does not seem to act as a repeater for the Z-wave signal. Is there a way to force it into repeater mode? 
8708 Missing item. I don t have the stand. 
8709 Very good overall experience. Easy purchase, fast delivery. Would recommend. 
8710 great extra battery 
8711 Not as strong as the GoPro branded mount. This is more like a mount for GPS or car-smartphone holder, but for mounting a action camera to a smooth surface that isn t subject to winds this works great. I would not use it outside, however. 
8712 It was just what I was looking for. Plenty of space for batteries and other accessories. 
8713 I love it ... It does what i need 
8714 charges well 
8715 Horrible device, mine came broken, it doesn t record my voice it only records a faint hardly noticeable noise and I haven t gotten a refund because I haven t gotten around to it 
8716 Works just liked it s supposed to. 
8717 The charger worked perfectly for my Canon 40D. I was impressed by the fact that the charger included an adaptor for the car. 
8718 Went out of control and crashed! 
8719 Not as heavy duty as I d hoped. I think it s a nice tripod. 
8720 This is positive feedback for Beach Audio. Great, great customer service. This company cares about their customers and with so many complaining about dealing with poor customer service I want Beach Audio to get their kudos. A++++++ And we love our cameras too. 
8721 Pretty decent accessories and most of them are useful. KILLER price and now I have a case to store the camera in also. 
8722 I didn t have to wait too long for it and it worked perfectly. Thank you. Now if I can get my order for cat med for fleas!!!! 
8723 Camera only lasted for just over a month of use. Can t return it now because order is over 30 days old. I guess you get what you pay for. 
8724 its cool 
8725 Very impressed with this camera! Custom white balance is a welcome change, underwater macro is superb, and the new microscope mode is insane. Still need to try out the time lapse/stitching settings, but have seen some first had results and am excited. 
8726 To use as a wrist strap, opening larger than we thought. 
8727 junk. to much set up and pain in the ass to put together. i want my money back 
8728 I like this lens for how cheap it is. You get a lot of bang for your buck. It s my go to lens for board sports. 
8729 Lifesaver for the camera if landing on rough terrain. Snaps on and secured with 4 (included) zipties. 
8730 It works OK. 
8731 Good 
8732 Good product for the price, works just as good as a go pro for a fraction of the price. 
8733 It was shipped quickly. Put batteries in it and put the cassette in it and it worked perfectly. 
8734 The software sucks. The fingerprint reader is terrible. Highly NOT RECOMMENDED. 
8735 Good quality picture, alot of fun 
8736 good 
8737 Great adapter for my vintage Pentax lens. Just screw it on and forget it. Works with Metabones Speedbooster also. 
8738 Great product, easy set up. 
8739 AAAAAAA++++++ 
8740 This has been a great little speedlight. My only complaint is that the batteries drain VERY quickly. It uses 4 AAs at a time. I have gotten in the habit of carrying spares with me, but batteries are not cheap. Overall, it s a good product. 
8741 I did not buy it. 
8742 Awesome Product. I have an LG G4 and it fits perfectly. Easy to Set up and get it going to shoot some nice video with the phone! 
8743 I have taken photos in complete dark with my Nikon D5500. Photos are very good and i have observed that intensity of flash is not varying with depending upon the darkness 
8744 Fast service. Nice product 
8745 Great little lens for the price.. A little distortion on the edges. I shoot real estate and it works for me. 
8746 a little flamzy 
8747 .but works loks like some parts may begin to give up soon 
8748 After shooting 1000 s of photos, I now know when to use it. When I do, pictures turn out great. 
8749 excellent build quality, lots of light. really great buy for the money. I bought three and a boom stand so I could do a full 3 point lighting set up. great for photography and videography. 
8750 i give three stars because the clip on the LCD screen side arrived broken. clip arrived broken. 
8751 Very easy to follow instructions, fits perfectly! 
8752 Love my gadgets thank you 
8753 fantastic lens at a great price 
8754 Works great. Love this battery charger. 
8755 Awesome pack that hasn t let me down. I may end up replacing it with a bigger Lowepro but for now it s been really great. 
8756 I am new to recording videos using a GOPRO and was looking for a good Kit to get me started on the right foot and I m glad I landed hear. This kit gave me lots of versatility to record a variety of videos. 
8757 Smart purchase. Biggest bang for the buck. 
8758 works well can adjust apperture 
8759 Is beautiful bag. 
8760 Works well and very durable. Must of crashed it at least 100 times and haven t broken anything yet. Longer battery life would be nice, but for the price you can t beat it. 
8761 Love this lens. Good build quality. The pictures I take come out very good. Buy a lens filter for it. 
8762 This is a good choice for zonal or hyper-focal pictures especially macro. 
8763 Arrived on time and as described. Works perfectly with my Go Pro Silver 
8764 all the features of its big brother in a compact size! excellent quality pics and video! 
8765 Just what I needed to mount camera on handlebar. good quality and camera feels secure. 
8766 I took it on vacation. It is very light. It is very strong. It is very stable. 
8767 The sharpness, rather better say non-sharpness after using this ND filters is terrible. I tested on high shutter speed, tripod mounted. The images is not usable. Buy expensive good quality filters or don t buy at all. 
8768 Love it! Kids love the picture printing. Eady to use! 
8769 It works as it should 
8770 Luxurious cover 
8771 it is awesome..I use it often 
8772 6 months later and still going strong! 
8773 Pretty good for the price. Takes a little time to get the cover on the camera. I wish there was some kind of instruction guide though. I could be doing this entirely wrong. 
8774 So far I have traveled to Israel, NYC (4 times), California, all over Florida and New England. Jets, Taxis, enormous walking, etc. This bag takes it all while still looking brand new. I just can not find any faults with this back. Sturdy, elegant and comfortable. 
8775 cheap crap- but I paid cheap--- you really need to get a TALLER tripod 
8776 Wonderful bag! Does not look like a camera bag and there is room for everything. 
8777 Cheap quality build and color is off 
8778 love everything especially the bag and head mount, however the gopole is really flimsy and i ended up buying a real gopole. but you cant beat it for the price! 
8779 Nice little bench top tripod - reasonably stable with camera and close up lens attached. 
8780 Great camera...night view is beautiful..is like daytime...recommended anytime.. 
8781 Work the first time coming out of the box. The next day? It stopped working. 
8782 please watch out. Mine was totally defect. I could not use them for my vacation. Returned them. 
8783 I m using this for my XIRO Xplorer quadcopter. Plenty of space for everything and more, plus plenty rugged for its price point. 
8784 perfect 
8785 The pole smells like metal and rusted after only one use. 
8786 flimsy 
8787 Great 
8788 The filter doesn t fit into my P Series holder, but works if I hold it up in front of the camera. Love the cool effects. 
8789 Delivered on time and it was exactly what I expected. 
8790 pain to use 
8791 For the price, it can t be beat. Since I already owned three of them when I ordered this one, that should speak for itself. 
8792 A & A makes very high quality products, and this nicely designed and well made strap is no exception. Flexible, strong and very comfortable. Highly recommend. 
8793 My cat chewed the cord into on my other charger, so I like the fact there is no cord, and it works just great. 
8794 Works great 
8795 :Lens was as advertised but it was supposed to come with three filters and there weren t any. I had to buy filter to protect lens. 
8796 Great price and quality. Good resolution with lots of features. Close up resolution could be a bit better. 
8797 Perfect fit for Sony RX100! 
8798 Works well! This case had enough room for me to store my camera as well as the charging cord. 
8799 sharp lens with great price. The lens gives great balance to my D800 with battery handle. 
8800 Poor video view and it don t have a HDMI on it 
8801 Battery seems to have trouble linking up to the Leica charger. I finally got it to charge and looks as though it charged fully. 
8802 Great camera, timely delivery 
8803 Sucks no other word to describe this item. A good looking watch I ll give it that but everything else sucks 
8804 Excelent 
8805 did good. did what i needed. 
8806 Great case for my camera. Fits my Canon very well and its a good quality. 
8807 I love this camera. Now I want to get the next lens up for the ability to zoom. Images are crisp, color is beautiful. This is a step up from my last camera and will be going to East Africa with me. 
8808 good 
8809 These reviews are clearly not written by real users of the product. Just read them and you ll see. 
8810 This lens is AWESOME. Pictures are amazing. Great purchase. 
8811 Excellent photo backpack. Very well priced. 
8812 Everything was fine. 
8813 Found out it is spring operated instead of battery.I don t know how long timing spring will last. Also took almost2 months for its arrival.it also rotates west to east,wrong way for tracking the heavenly bodies. 
8814 Works as advertised 
8815 Works great 
8816 I use this on my Manfrotto Mono-pod. I use it to hold my light. Strong and durable,and flexible for sure. I use it at all my parties and now I can t live without it. 
8817 The string that attaches to the camera is so thin and weak that a strong gust of wind will threaten to snap it. I lost my camera on a particularly rough dive this past winter when the string let go. 
8818 Okay for the price ... It had oil or something weird on it when I got it: It s pretty sturdy, though I d suggest finding something better if you have money to spend. 
8819 Exactly what I was expecting. For a domestic use it is hihgly recommended. 
8820 Perfect Fit for my tripod. 
8821 Excellent, as described in the publication I received, the delivery was fast without mishap, satisfied 100% 
8822 Great product , Nice and lightweight for hiking ! 
8823 excellent 
8824 Love this case, fits my SX280 like a glove and keeps it safe and ready. The soft inside keeps the screen from getting scratched too. 
8825 I bought it as a backup battery, I have no idea of the quality, but the price is worth the gamble. 
8826 Perfect 
8827 I bought this to go with my Concept2 SkiErg. Works like a charm. 
8828 It works just fine. 
8829 pros. easy setup, provided e-mail uploads. multi cloud service connectable dropbox. picasa. etc. motion sensor on/off cons. TN pannel. can t hanging - no wall mount hole. 
8830 AFAITH® Professional SLR Camera Tripod Monopod... was a gift for my daughter and she loved it 
8831 Great price 
8832 Amazing quality 
8833 fair price 
8834 It s good, but hard to keep fixed in the right position. 
8835 As expected 
8836 Works like a charm on nikon d3300, timelaps, or shot photos without touching cam, like on/off button. Took me a moment to understand it all but not long, was my first of this kind 
8837 Completely made of plastic. Feels like a knockoff. Returned it immediately 
8838 Sturdy, comfortable. Works with Canon 5D and 1Ds and Sony A77 and a99. 
8839 Excellent product. Seems to be a durable and well constructed. Bluetooth did not work with my phone HTC 1S. Would not activate camera button. After installing Camera 360 app (awesome app) worked great. Glad I purchased this item. 
8840 So far the charger works well and the batteris seem to have a decent life 
8841 An absolute bargain. I use with my Olympus OMD EM5MII. Now I don t have to live in fear of losing one. 
8842 On 2nd battery, as first wouldn t charge. Still having problems and getting &#34;check battery pack&#34; message. This is after actually reading the directions that state that the battery needs to be fully cycled several times. 
8843 Panasonic is a top tier Li battery producer. I got these on 8/26/2015, with expiration date of January 2024. That s 8 years which is perfectly fine with me. 1/2 the current price of EverReady at retail. 
8844 Excellent product 
8845 Works wonders. My gear has never been more clean. 
8846 I love this camera!!!! It takes great pictures and the battery life is great!!!! 
8847 Used it at the beach, kept my cube clean and dry. 
8848 Great set of accessories for an awesome price. 
8849 works great just be careful taking ur phone out as my first one broke like this but other then that works as its supposed to will recoomend to others 
8850 ok 
8851 It s all ok! 
8852 Auto focus broke after 2 months of use. Cost me 20$ to ship back to get repaired. Luckily it s a 6 year warranty. We will see how it is when I get it back, and if it holds up. Other than that it s a decent lens. 
8853 love them, they are definitely a detouring device 
8854 Love it! 
8855 Received by USPS and it is decoded as it charges using Olympus Charger BCN1. Non decoded battery do not charge on this device. 
8856 Nice syma 
8857 The accessories are quality accessories! They all work quite well, they are a little harder to screw in because they aren t made my go pro, but you can t go wrong because of the low price. 
8858 So far these are great and a fraction of the gopro cost! I am using these for a SJCAM M10 camera. Works just fine. Seems to be high quality too. 
8859 First one was blurry and unusable. Had it returned. The 2nd one works just fine. Picture quality is not super, but it does the job. 
8860 its small its kinda cool it works. its a small very cheap toy. really. 
8861 I purchased this to replace a lost lens cap for my Canon 58 mm lens. It fit the lens perfectly and came with a very nice microfiber lens cleaner which I really appreciated. Arrived quickly and safely packaged. Would definitely recommend. 
8862 what exactly is high resolution about these pieces of glass? I threw out the cheapo case and two of the lens... I only needed a protective lens. 
8863 A great compact high resolution camera loaded with features. Small enough to slip into your pocket 
8864 Look great and can t wait to try it out. 
8865 Great value for what you pay for. The vest on its own is 40.00, at the store. Yeah, it s not the best quality, but it s also not bad. 
8866 Excellent photos in low light and great videos. A winner 
8867 Solid product. 
8868 I am pleased as usual with sony products,that is why i am a repeater customer.keep on that track and quality level and like arnold says,I WILL BE BACK.107-4228565-2601021 
8869 work wonderfully they are able to charge in the official Nikon charger that came with my camera D3200 and provide the same photo time 
8870 What a pain in the ass to get on but worth it. Snug tight fit. The adhesive strip for the collar doesn t seem to want to stay on. Maybe it was my fault since I didn t clean it thoroughly, I donno 
8871 Perfect fit for my camera. Easy to install. 
8872 It works fine 
8873 When I used it the water went there waterproof Case do t buy This 
8874 Great item. All of the family love this. Easy to use and made well. 
8875 just as described 
8876 I bought this to monitor my Whole House Humidification system in attic after a bad experience with a leak. It was a little difficult to set up but support was superior to others and works fine. 
8877 I like amozon. 
8878 Im happy with this monopod, perhaps looking back I might have spent the money on a really sturdy dedicated video tripod..... As getting perfectly still shots is still a little tricky with this. The S6 head is great! 
8879 good price and product. 
8880 works as expected 
8881 👍👍👍👍 
8882 Good product! 
8883 This is a great tool to use selfies on a party I went to we took 4 pictures until we got the right one...when I bought this I took a selfie of my self in 1 picture and it was perfect 
8884 did not focus waste of time and money 
8885 We needed this! 
8886 Works great. Cant beat the price. It was exactly what I was looking for. 
8887 Its been a week and i feel the camera is Awesome. We used it as novelty item for our party and all our guests loved it.. Buy one for urself and I m sure your guests will be impressed.. 
8888 Fits my blackmagic pocket cam but does not focus. I have a 50mm 1.8 stm canon lens on manual and it will not focus??? 
8889 I like this camera, I can watch my dog when I am away. The night vision is good. It rotates and tilts well enough and was up and running very fast. I will buy another one for my front door. 
8890 Aweomse price for a fun toy 
8891 Greatest little camera. Takes wonderful pictures, love the zoom, and it fits in my purse so nicely. Wonderful for traveling when nice pictures are in the plan. 
8892 The description states FI9826W but I received the FI9821W refurbished which is much cheaper and does not have the zoom function I expected to receive. 
8893 They don t stay charged long... Very disappointed.... 
8894 It is a little loose on the gopro, but holds it secure enough. The camera can still slide a small amount in it, but it hasn t fallen out of it yet. It would be nice if there were a way to tighten it more. 
8895 Works just as described by seller. Shipped promptly and was ably to enjoy & use for the trips I had planned! Perfect addition to my GoPro collection. 
8896 It works as designed and seems like it will last a long time, for the money. 
8897 It works well with my Pentax K-50 DSLR camera; now I will not be worry if the camera battery becomes discharged. 
8898 The WiFi receiver isn t so great. I can connect a phone, iPod, notebook to WiFi in the same place where this camera struggles to get a connection. 
8899 Did not fit my camera at all and when I asked to return it, they just asked me why and didn t allow me t 
8900 Very disappointe 
8901 Worked great, no problems at all. 
8902 It hold s my Iphone 6plus really good, love it. 
8903 GOT THIS FOR MY GIRLFRIEND BECAUSE SHE SHOOTS YOUTUBE VIDEOS AND IT LOOKS AMAZING !! QUALITY OF LIGHTING IS SOO MUCH BETTER AND THIS LIGHT IS SUPER EASY TO OPERATE ! 
8904 GREAT PRODUCT. RECOMENDT IT. 
8905 even with warming filter it is still very cold. mounts are very fragile and loose. barndoors do help and the stands are decent. you only get three filters.for the price they work but don t expect them to hold up to a lot of abuse. 
8906 Cheaply made but gets the job done. Works well with an iPhone 6 
8907 very nice,better than i thought, 
8908 this was a steal of a deal. I was not sure if to trust the seller, but the lens was brand new, no faults and still taking good images. 
8909 Work as expected. Really fun to use. 
8910 I learned the hard way that this camera is not good at action shots. 
8911 Couldn t use them. my camera died. 
8912 save your money!!! Please dont buy it! 
8913 Well made and reasonably priced, very satisfied. 
8914 didn t work with my technology 
8915 Good deal 
8916 Great filter, works just as expected! 
8917 The product works well as claimed. 
8918 great item, very good for my a6000 
8919 really great camera, still reasonable weight. 
8920 The product is very good. Have had it for about a year now and has worked well. Had to abandon the Comcast router for another to keep the cameras from dropping out constantly. Picture quality could be better, the HD cameras might be the way to go. Hope this helps. 
8921 It s ok. The quality is not great but I didnt pay as much as other cameras. The battery did run out a bit quickly, had to switch batteries twice in our 5 day vacation. 
8922 Works great! Excellent customer service and setup too! 
8923 latching mechanism popped off and was lost the first time i used it! 
8924 As expected 
8925 Batteries can in good time. They work perfectly, and were a steal at the price. I will definitely order from this person again. 
8926 good price 
8927 nice 
8928 Excellent product, happy with the purchase. 
8929 Excelente 
8930 This was the size recommended but did not fit my lens 
8931 Came just as advertised. All moving parts work smoothly. Nice and light if you have to carry it any distance. This might be a small hindrance on a windy day but altogether happy with my purchase. 
8932 Awesome camera, so much fun! 
8933 Very good 
8934 Great drone , fast shipping 
8935 Very pleased 
8936 Does the job 
8937 excellent service, product works as described. 
8938 Good price compared to battery stores 
8939 Works great. 
8940 Heavy duty case. Used to secure my GoPro and accessories. 
8941 Just ok 
8942 Nice! 
8943 Love this camera. Easy to use. 
8944 worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks. 
8945 Lost the charger for my camera. Perfect replacement and cheaper than ordering original! 
8946 just ok 
8947 Good quality. 
8948 Lost my GoPro while whitewater rafting, as I relied on just this head strap to secure the camera to my helmet. Should have had an additional chin strap and &#34;floaty&#34; back door for some redundancy. 
8949 This set-up is exactly what I was looking for and at a great price. It works great with my D5300 and the off camera remote is an awesome bonus. 
8950 Nice kit and well built except for the &#34;selfy stick&#34;. 
8951 the camera harness is exceptional! I can hike, hands free and have my camera at the instant ready. Many thanks. 
8952 No problems, fits perfectly as described. Check your lens first to make sure you know what you are ordering. 
8953 Great product. 
8954 The camera is surpsingly small and excelent recording with good sound quality 
8955 Good product for a good price 
8956 Rainbow colors add really cool artistic touch to photos! Would definitely recommend this! 
8957 i love the style, color and size of this Digi Bab....will come in handy for small items when i go biking or kayaking 
8958 A lot of bang for the buck. Easy setup with the available app. Great day and night picture. 
8959 Everything was as promised. Thanks! 
8960 Poor quality all the way around vision is blurry and the audio pretty much don t work unless you re right on it!! But you get what you pay 4.:-! :-\ 
8961 I received my go pro filter in a timely manner. It fit great and it was everything I expected. 
8962 Great Product.... made of real good material well thought out. 
8963 Good camera easy to Operate The remote is not that great interfere with the TV if you have Samsung and accessories are not that strong I already had two broke 
8964 Camera video quality is great 
8965 To sum up my experience. This is an awesome easy to use and very versatile webcam that just works. I love the movement and sound detection. 
8966 one word, perfect! 
8967 Came as described 
8968 Would have been better if you could see the picture you want to take through the camera, The case blocks your viewing ability. 
8969 OK it all! 
8970 Great charger 
8971 Love the easy of start up & using this camera having never had one prior. wish we would have got an upgraded model to view video directly on camera. works great; used biking, hiking, rappelling & in ocean. 
8972 I still have my old camera. Love the fact that I found this. 
8973 CAMERA WASN T AVAILABLE AFTER ORDERING AND CAN T GET A REFUND FROM SQUARE TRADE!!!! 
8974 Works Like A Charm! No Complaints Its Fits Just like the factory unit 
8975 Great add-on a must for any lens to keep the lens cover close! 
8976 Love these, 3 settings: normal, small pet, large pet. Easy to install & connect. 
8977 these come in very handy when I do a quick change of lens 
8978 Horrible camera. 
8979 Pretty much what you d expect. Works fine, not elegant construction, ask me in a year how sturdy it is. 
8980 Good image quality, battery life is short so I bought rechargeable batteries 
8981 Zippers no good both have broken off. now I need a new bag 
8982 Does not appear to work unless plugged directly into router. I have asked how to get it to connect on its own without the ethernet cable but received no response. 
8983 Gave it as a gift and she loves it. Sturdy construction and very roomy. 
8984 wrong cord 
8985 Great product and a great price with fast delivery. 
8986 Very good quality, especially the velvet on the back of the strap that keeps it from slipping off the shoulder and adds comfort when hung around the neck. Colors are very vibrant. 
8987 Nice beginners kit. We use it for green screen videos. Works great. 
8988 Convenient and protects well. I m glad I got it, especially since the camera does not have a lens cover. 
8989 Perfect companion to camera. 
8990 Great product with long range capability. 
8991 Great for keeping my lenses clean 
8992 Used in many of my bags and protects all the equipment. 
8993 Works exactly as advertised 
8994 Very high quality camera bag with a ton of space for extra lenses or multiple cameras. Exceeded expectations! 
8995 What can I say. this table tripod is so sturdy it can hold my Canon 70D with a Canon 70-200 2.8 IS II with the tripod attached to the lens. This tripod is always in my camera bag and very helpful when in the field. 
8996 excellent camera, meets all functionalities, all good quality fittings 
8997 The price and quality of the camera is great. 100% recommended this item 
8998 In love with my camera 
8999 Very good camera 
9000 Excellent product and accessories. 
9001 VERY short range!! 
9002 like advertised! I was able to fit in far more number of accessories than i expected. The medium case makes a lot of sense size wise unless you are working for a production media house. :) 
9003 Works great on my a6000 and a7ii. No batteries to go dead. 
9004 This bundle is wonderful. It has everything one could ever need for learning how to use a DSLR. I am still learning so much and this kit covers all of it. Absolute best starter kit one could ask for. 
9005 It s all ok! 
9006 I do love this camera, so does my wife, very easy to master and such high quality images. Expensive for a small camera but definitely worth it. 
9007 Works well and comes in handy. 
9008 Love it & great for beginner. Travel friendly. 
9009 Very nice bokek lens. 
9010 Great product. Arrived In 2 days. Gave it a &#34;once over&#34; then closed it & held it under water for about 10 minutes. Upon inspection the inside was dry. Definitely a smart investment for a minimal price 
9011 Works great. The only tip try fixing the right angle and check a pre video of it, before jumping into your board. It will save you some dissappointment time. 
9012 Very good product, great deal for the money i pay, 
9013 As advertised 
9014 Shipped quickly and was as expected 
9015 Great product! The product arrived quickly with no issues. 
9016 Worked fine have purchased these before 
9017 Versatile and small. Not heavy at all,but can hold alot of weight if need be. I have put a light, a receiver,and a mic on this piece and it has not let me down. 
9018 works great and fixed issue of camera not staying on :) 
9019 This camera is great, the goodies that came with it are awesome too. It survived a direct hit from several water balloons, shaving cream, and a few high speed drops while filming an event. Great point and shoot with the flexibility of an action camera. 
9020 Shipping was incredibly fast and arrived 2 days early even without prime. Both batteries work and everything is correct. Nothing much complicated about this. They are batteries. Either they work or they dont. 
9021 Stiff on the neck 
9022 as expected. 
9023 Great buy. More batteries life. 
9024 Purchased this during Amazon s anniversary sale. Works as intended, it seems to be well built out of some solid plastic. I ll trust that it will hold my camera just fine. It s not the greatest stabilization, but way better than just hand holding the camera. 
9025 Very good. 
9026 Great binoculars for birdwatching. 
9027 It was no problem to use or appearance. 
9028 Just what I wanted! Thanks. 
9029 I got this for my sister for her birthday. I can t believe the amount of accessories that came with it! Was way more than expected and I know she s absolutely going to love this! Also shipped super fast! Thanks! 
9030 Excelent product 
9031 works well 
9032 I love the album...it is exactly what I wanted. Gallery Leather has earned 5 stars from this satisfied customer. The service was prompt and the delivery right on time. Thanks so much. rpb 
9033 WOW WHAT A CAMERA! Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS45W FULL STEAM ahead. A great travel zoom camera MUST.Wifi \ 16 MP \easy upload\ video perfect. 
9034 GoPro 
9035 the size is suitable for small jobs but I would like the power of the lamps was better. 
9036 Surprisingly versatile with a firm grip. I much prefer this set to the OEM Sony backpack mount. 
9037 great 
9038 Price was good, and the cable works just great with my camera so no complaints at all. Looks like it s good quality too. 
9039 Picture quality is great and is easy to use. Convenient size making picture taking in close up situations easier than pulling out the SLR. 
9040 Good scope. Easy to set up and use. Better optics then the price would suggest. 
9041 Very easily to use and small enough to carry around with you on trips. 
9042 Perfect match ! 
9043 Exact replacement. Needed a good additional battery for outdoor travels! 
9044 Perfect 
9045 The charger came in ahead of promised date and was as advertised 
9046 It is a very good deal for the amateur photographer. I love the pictures that it takes. Very simple to operate. 
9047 bought it for my daughter, she loves it. 
9048 Excellent product 
9049 Fast shipping! Items came as I expected. Good quality and I definitely will order from 47th again. 
9050 these stands are very light, appear a little delicate, but with good handling are fantastic 
9051 awesome! 
9052 I love this products and ill suggest any one who do diving to buy. Its really nice 
9053 As ordered. On time. A bit awkward to use. Not as useful as I had hoped. 
9054 Return it 
9055 The ring does not work at all !! It is not possible to focus properly with any FD-lens, probably due to the inserted ekstra lens in the adapter. Waste of Money ! Frank Visti 
9056 Solid little camera extension, I used it with a GoPro 
9057 These batteries seem to work well. The battery that the collar came with is still working fine. I will be able to comment more after I have used these. Thanks! 
9058 Added some life to a laptop we were ready to toss out. Fits perfectly and seems to hold a charge reasonably well. 
9059 Too small for the camera models suggested. 
9060 Seems to be working fine 
9061 Great photos but there is a long lag in video recording. 
9062 Great camera for a beginner like me :) 
9063 The case it self was very nice but there was lots of delays 
9064 Great Value! 
9065 I think the Note about no hard drive should be up at the top. I know this is intentional to sell a system cheap. 
9066 pleased with the order.:) 
9067 Isnt last as long as the Sony battery. 
9068 Way too big for this girl. 
9069 Not pro quality but a good get by. Mine was missing the cleaning cloth. Sharpness a little weak on the edges but very usable. 
9070 this gooseneck is worthless, it is almost impossible to twist (massive grip between the joints) and any flexion or shortening (separating the joints) causes them to fracture. Boooo! 
9071 Look real and your nosey neighbors will look like dummies! 
9072 Camera worked well in &#34;live&#34; mode, but failed to respond in &#34;motion detection&#34; at any setting on both cameras I purchased. Easy to set up and a great clear picture, but I purchased them for the motion detection feature and cannot get it to work after a month of trying. 
9073 Excellent product. Great construction. Put this on my bicycle along a 12 mile trail and it was perfect. No complaints. 
9074 Works as described. Forgot it s there after a few days now always have a record of all activity. 
9075 very nice~! 
9076 It is very well made and versatile. I use it for a compact camera bag with space for extra batteries. I took it on a cruise and it was rugged and did an excellent job. 
9077 Works great! 
9078 I received it earlier than expected which is great! It works really well, I had it on the side of my car for the first time and it stayed on. Good quality and price! I will buy it again with my second GoPro. 
9079 Well made bigger than I expected. I will order a scene set for more bounce work. Shipping was slower than expected but was reasonable. 
9080 Product arrived very promptly, great pricing for a beginner set. I couldn t be happier with my purchase! 
9081 Love it! Does everything it says. Great price 
9082 Perfect... 
9083 The leg post will not work after a few uses. The locking mechanism is cheaply made and, after a short time, will break. I can only use it from a sitting position now - not standing as the legs will not elongate anymore. Very disappointing. 
9084 Sent this back. I m not a rocket scientist. 
9085 Excellent product,quick to charge two batteries in about half the time of the charger that came with the camera. Has a screen that tells the amount of charge the battery has and how much more charge is needed to get a fully charged battery. 
9086 Super clear, Decided on 12 over 10 for Colorado trip. fast shipping 
9087 Mainly plastic but it does hold a small camera on a bike very well. Does the job. 
9088 5 years later still working perfect. only downfall is the battery level reading is inaccurate 
9089 I really like the price but I was really surprised by the quality of the product I thought it would have been a GoPro product by looking at it 
9090 Very good 
9091 The remote did not work with my canon 5D as indicated. 
9092 Love it! 
9093 I gave it as a gift. It s OK. 
9094 works fine. it seems sturdy enough. 
9095 Tried it on my car and didn t scratch or fall off! 
9096 One of the two I used broke on the prongs 
9097 Good color, great wide angle view, it worth the money! 
9098 we used it twice and one of the propellers stopped working. don t know how to get ahold of anyone for parts and if there is a warranty 
9099 pretty sure this is copy write infringement... or at the very least toeing the line. http://store.froknowsphoto.com/ 
9100 Returned the product. Items were missing from a sealed box. 
9101 first one was not connecting wireless to phone or ipad. was on phone with tech support for 90 minutes and they couldn t get it to work. Will try a replacement. Software would not recognize camera and connect. 
9102 fits right! 
9103 Perfect replacement for GoPro Hero 4 Silver case. Original was cheap plastic which broke in no time. Be sure to add some threadlock to the screw that holds this part in place. 
9104 Worked perfectly as described!!! 
9105 Got all my solar lights going again without costing a fortune. 
9106 works fine 
9107 The add listed this as a Panasonic Lumix charger. It is a GENERIC charger that barely even works and it is so bulky it won t fit into my small camera bag like the original Panasonic charger did. 
9108 Great product! 
9109 Battery function does not work cannot seem to charge battery. 
9110 Excellent 
9111 This is another product that I got for my trip and I can t say enough about it. I m in love with this camera. I got if for myself as a gift for my birthday and it works great. I m so glad that I got it. 
9112 Can t get it to work. It works maybe once out of ever 20 clicks if I hold it right up against the camera. I m using it with a Nikon D3200 
9113 Great product and Amazon customer service is top notch. Thank you 
9114 Works fine, indistinguishable from the original. 
9115 Never lose your cap again--such a simple idea, works great! 
9116 Missing half of what s in the listing 
9117 Really good product , especially using it to hold the baby monitor. 
9118 batteries as advertised mor power than factory battery 
9119 kept me from losing my GoPro camera while snorkeling in the Virgin Islands! 
9120 Called for customer serviec and spoke with Walter. Made it a breeze to set up. 
9121 Best security cameras. Better than I expected. Set up was such a breeze. Customer service is wonderful! Had th3se for a few months now and I couldn t be happier!! Getting ready to order 4 more cameras. 
9122 Very good product and really does look like a TV or computer is being used. 
9123 This camera works pretty good 
9124 Amazing device! Must try! 
9125 flash is great, remote not so much. go with the flash only kit. 
9126 All good. 
9127 I bought this screen protector and was excited to use it. I put it on my D7100 and it s immediately cracked on the right corner. I m terribly disappointed with this product and I will be returning it immediately. 
9128 Good cleaning cloth for my glasses. It does require hand-wash which maintains it. 
9129 I havent dropped my GoPro in a lake or the ocean yet- so I will update my post when I do. It looks great on my camera tho! 
9130 its good for protection but its restrict the movement of screen for selfie etc 
9131 really pretty good.... 
9132 Comes with a pricetag however much better than friction mounts that looks like this at the fraction of the cost. This arm will not drop your monitor or camera any time soon. 
9133 I was very disappointed the case will not hold the camera. I would like to contact the seller.I am satisfied with the camera. 
9134 Would have given it a five star review after the first handful of wearing. Only four one as it is not quite as effective but still helps. 
9135 Great replacement. Fit great. 
9136 Great little device that simplifies password hassels, well made and fantastic quality 
9137 Nice product. Liked it a lot. 
9138 Handy, but the clip broke from me picking it up without even touching the clip... But I ll cut it some slack for the low price. 
9139 Two thumbs up! Very happy with this lens! 
9140 Happy with this 
9141 Charger and batteries work great! 
9142 Shipped fast, worked as anticipated! 
9143 Pretty poor quality. It doesn t hold the flashes secure. I had them fall out a few times and it broke after just two days of use. I cannot recommend this 
9144 I love the camera, it gives me great pictures, many choices and easy to use. 
9145 it was a gift he loved it 
9146 I had the same product when it was produced by pentex 
9147 great in the garage but not so much in active living space. 
9148 After a few months, it doesn t satisfyingly click into place. And when you put it on backwards it doesn t stay in place really well. Overall, does it s job well. 
9149 Very useful!!! 
9150 Love it 
9151 very easy to use, fast shipping. 
9152 Top of the line! What more can i say! 
9153 All ok 
9154 small compact, only negative is the center column, Worked great with it down and a good ball head. I am 5 5 so the center column was down most of the time. I liked the retractable spike in the feet. 
9155 Camera takes very nice pictures and video. The lens that is included is amazing. This package deal included everything that I needed to start out. 
9156 Excellent customer service. Great cameras. 
9157 I have big wrist and it fits well 
9158 I love my Nissin flash. This thing has great power for the size. The zoom operation is a bit funky though. 
9159 Cord is a tad short but the device works very well. Pretty straight forward. Make sure to pick up a pack of AAA batteries before ordering. 
9160 Perfect 
9161 threw charger away kept batteryfor clickers 
9162 Works well except the light is substandard. 
9163 Great case for XQD cards 
9164 excellent item, solved my problem 
9165 [[ASIN:B004BDNJZA Jill-e Designs 022738 Clutch for Camera (Red)]] 
9166 Works exactly as expected. Christmas morning pictures last year turned out awesome! 
9167 Charger works great.. on occasion it will report that one battery isn t fully charged, but when you remove the &#34;full&#34; battery, the other then immediately reports as being full. Good enough. 
9168 Camera is easy to use but a lot of that power goes to waste when you cant process RAW images...Canon s web site blows when it comes to downloading codec. 
9169 easy to set up and excellent quality great customer service 
9170 it s small and perfect 
9171 Great product easy to use, works as designed. 
9172 I wish they sold this case without the foam, but the case isn t that expensive so I just threw the foam away. 
9173 Highly Recommended! 
9174 A little on the big side got to use at an angle but does get the job done 
9175 Just as described , works and feels wonderful on my camera ;) 
9176 GRREAT!!! 
9177 super cool 
9178 For the cost I expected either an aluminum lense hood or one of the fouls back rubber types. What I got was a thin plastic hood that looks like it could break easily. I ll have to be careful. 
9179 Excellent lens for the money. 
9180 Performs very well. Carry it with me most of the time. 
9181 Total pain in the butt to set up!! 
9182 excellent item, solved my problem 
9183 seem to work great. 
9184 Really nice lens. Great quality, smooth focus and very sharp. Works with my fujifilm xe-1 
9185 One of the best values you ll find in a camera accessory of its type but be prepared for sparse and poorly written instruction that truly have to be read with a magnifier. 
9186 Arrived on time and worked great!! 
9187 Not quite up to the Olympus branded original battery but low price; I carry 3 in my camera bag - never w/o power. 
9188 i loved it...... until it got lost in the ocean witch was NOT the proudcts fualt 
9189 so cute and so portable. :D 
9190 I liked all the attachments but only a few of the fit my gopro 4 
9191 Worth the price! 
9192 Great camera for our school. These are &#34;little bit&#34; wide angle so they work great in ceiling tiles. We used mostly these and couple of the regular UVC s and Pro s for a small school installation and it works great. Yet another awesomely useful hardware by Ubiquiti. 
9193 It worked great to charge my camera. Recommended. 
9194 Was not what I expected! 
9195 Great 
9196 Considering the price of a Hoya CPL filter, this works great, cuts glare, enhances colors, makes the blue sky more blue and the clouds stand out. 
9197 Shipping is fast and quality is good 
9198 it s alright 
9199 helps with my photo work 
9200 great seller,nice product,for now it works well 
9201 It seemed to be a fine product at a great price. However I returned it because it wouldn t work with my intended lens. Great service by the seller. Was not his fault. 
9202 It does mostly what I want. It takes some figuring out but if you read the Q&A below it s doable. Still trying to figure out how to set the time, but for what you pay, it s pretty damn good. 
9203 Just got mine today it feels good in the head but never tried and water oh and plus the wrist strap is too small and is weird 
9204 Great little pack for those long trips and vacations. 
9205 Product was described to work with go pro camera mounts. The mount would not tighten to secure the go pro. Reached out to the seller with no response. Extremely disappointed. 
9206 The eTopxizu go pro is awesome. I couldn t use the jaw clamp on my bike but put a quick release self adhesive clip on my bike and works great very nice setup. 
9207 Easy set up and easy to use! I love the ease with which I was able to install this camera and the clarity of the picture! 
9208 Works great on all of our apple products. The price was amazing for the the amount of cloths you get. I highly recommend this product if you have any electronic that need a soft cloth. I will be buying more when I need them or for a gift. 
9209 Great Product! I used this for a Tough Mudder and has no issues with it falling off, slipping, or bouncing around. Very Comfortable product as well. 
9210 Awesome Camera... small and the quality...is great 
9211 It works fine not the best picture at nice. I found another camera that 800 tvl and $1.50 cheat. With way better picture and much better night view. I would not buy this one again 
9212 works great plugged it in and mount the sensor that s it 
9213 GREAT CAMERA FOR THE PRICE. KEEP IT AROUND MY NECK ON MOTORCYCLE TRIPS FOR THOSE UNEXPECTED MOMENTS............. 
9214 nice 
9215 I am happy about this battery. Works good. Thanks... 
9216 Works perfectly. Why anybody would spend four to six times as much for the branded equivalent is beyond me. 
9217 Horrible what a waste of my hard earned money is all I can say! I did not even want to give it a star pretty sorry! 
9218 This doesnt even deserve one star. 
9219 Solid build, sharp design & perfect match! 
9220 This case was okay when new but, over time, the inside lining started to fray. Some of the lint got into the camera and damaged it. The camera lens can no longer zoom. 
9221 Purchased without a hitch, but never was able to register as the camera I purchased this for was a poor quality camera that arrived damaged and was returned. 
9222 Exactly what I wanted to toss into my camera bag. Makes setting a white/grey/black balance in variable lighting conditions easy. I like to shoot one picture at the beginning of a series with these cards visible. Then when I get into Lightroom/Photoshop I can quickly set my white balance. 
9223 This is from a very fine German firm Schneider. I have been to their factory and seen their works. They have been one of the finest lens makers in the world for many years. There is a noticeable difference between this and other filters. 
9224 Works perfectly, very durable. 
9225 The charger works well, but very disappointed that caps are not on the batteries in order to prevent them from shorting out in camera bag. I liked the tripod and cleaning kit that came with it, however the battery caps are more important. 
9226 Motion trigger is pretty good. Lightning trigger is rubbish!! 
9227 Great picture frames. Used them as part of a centerpiece. 
9228 The swabs were different sizes and all it did was smear cleaning solution on my sensor. I ended up having to pay to have it professionally cleaned anyway. 
9229 Nice photos 
9230 Just what I needed. 
9231 To much to adjust. Head locking device does not hold the scope tight. The screw that tensions on the scope mount fell out on my first back packing trip. Also a little heavy. 
9232 awesome 
9233 the battery arrived two days later than expected. for whatever reason, the batter charge only lasted 1 day before having to recharge it again. Now after one month, the batter is no longer chargeable. 
9234 The quality of this I thought was going to be cheep. I was surprised very sturdy well worth the money! 
9235 I use this bag for my Nikon D7100. Plenty of room in the bag, without being bulky. A great bag for the price, I highly recommend it. 
9236 The GOBUDi stick totally met my expectations. It s got a nice and practical design. Couldn t expect any better for this prize. 
9237 Good and useful 
9238 Received replacement, worse than the first, all the unit does it vibrate, then shuts off, then starts to continuously vibrate again without any input from the remote, remote is totally useless. Starting to believe that there is no quality control or testing before sending these products out. 
9239 Havent tried them out yet. Got them for vacation. But tried my friends and ig these work as well they will be great. 
9240 Blocked out too much light. Couldn t see much with it and when I returned it I had to pay the shipping 
9241 Product received undamaged and works as expected. 
9242 Perfect for camera. Great space for several attachments 
9243 cool 
9244 The instructions on disk do not go well with this clock. The buttons are not labeled the same or even close to what is in the instructions. I don t have the time to decode it. I wouldn t make this purchase again. 
9245 Great Product, just wish they wouldnt put any lettering on outside but can easily be removed with sand paper..Great Price 
9246 Excellent camera! 
9247 Very happy 
9248 Nice camera for it size and cost 
9249 I was looking for a better camera for casual family shots as my old one took so long to recover between shots. This seems to fit what I need in a simple to operate mode. It was also in the price range I was looking for. 
9250 Rated these 2 stars because although these are really cool. They are not HD. They aren t worth this much money if they are claiming to be full 1080p HD because they aren t high quality. 
9251 GREAT CAMERA EVEN DURING WINTER IT CA DO IT MAKE GREEN TREE COLOR 
9252 this camera software is not good , and setup is not very ease , after some figuring out got it to work but would not buy again , the camera specs are good but the app to operate on mobile app is not, remote view away from home gives trouble 
9253 Came missing parts. 
9254 Much larger and bulkier than I thought it d be. 
9255 Worked perfectly with my Sony Xperia Z3 phone. It succeed my expectations. Will recommend to my friends 
9256 Received exactly as described. We are still working our way through figuring out how to use all of the attachments! 
9257 Excelent product 
9258 [[ASIN:B00OV9IB2A Spy Tec STI_ZIR32 Surveillance Cameras]] 
9259 Keeps me at ease, took a lil bit of time to learn but got it down! 
9260 Awesome 
9261 Amazing tripod head, works great! 
9262 I used these in my Nikon camera and have had excellent luck. I see no difference in battery life between these and the factory original. I think these actually have more milliwhatevers than the factory one. 
9263 So worth getting the bulk pack instead of buying them individually. You save money and have lots of film just in case :) 
9264 Great lens. Can not beat it for the price. 
9265 The plug was obviously corroded before it was shipped out. I should have taken the other recent reviews at face value. 
9266 Batteries arrived quickly. High quality product. Everything in order. Highly recommend. 
9267 Great 
9268 Working good but not very easy to install on flash. Size for standard size (not small) flashes only. 
9269 Fits the Canon powershot SX60 well. Light and certainly fit for purpose. 
9270 Works great, took a while to realize if in the locked position, the camera does not recognize it. 
9271 rec d as promised and as advertised 
9272 Good enough for me. I haven t used the Nikon or Sigma wide angles so I can t compare, but this one has F/2.8, good autofocus and is wide enough for interiors and landscape. 
9273 Amazing product. We ve used the heck out of it since we bought it! Took it on a vacation to south Florida and it helped us make and remember more memories than we ve been able to before. It s a great buy I highly recommend. 
9274 A wonderful pocket camera. 
9275 Solidly built. Haven t figured the LCD display yet. The remote is line-of-sight, if you re off by a couple of degrees it won t work. 
9276 Small one isn t as small as I hoped and the large ones are huge. Well enough made and will protect the lenses. 
9277 Great Value! 
9278 convenient. Adds a lot of life. 
9279 awesome case. very well made and solid. love it for my camera lenses!!! 
9280 Case leaks you get what you pay for 
9281 This monopod is light, extremely strong and stable. Wish I d found this sooner. 
9282 It was the best GoPro on the market.. Do your research. 
9283 what was advertised as a &#34;kit&#34; containing mini tripod and micro sd card, was just the case. 
9284 bought it as a gift ...need an accessories bag for all the stuff! 
9285 was very satisfied with the product,work excellent with my camcorder. 
9286 WIFI is iffy, would be better with Bluetooth or screen mirroring technology. Hard to use if you have large hands. 
9287 Its a great battery but its a high price is there a OEM cheaper ??? 
9288 Great deal for price. 
9289 I tried other suction cup products but this is the best one. Holds firm driving on pretty rugged roads. 
9290 Works like a charm with my Nikon camera when i went ziplining recently. Very sturdy and well built. 
9291 Arrived broken! 
9292 Fast delivery and products were as advertised 
9293 Used it a few times already, great audio. 
9294 Best lens you can get. One of the sharpest if not the sharpest. 
9295 Thanks!!! 
9296 Stopped working and I waited to long to return it. 
9297 Great price. 
9298 Exactly what I was expecting. Thank you! 
9299 Does the job but overpriced! 
9300 Have only been using this camera for about a week. I was using a D7100 which I love. The D750 allows me to take full advantage of some of my older &#34;pre digital&#34; Nikon lenses. Its early but so far I love this camera. 
9301 Excellent mount 
9302 This may be cheaper than the Canon brand but it works great! I love my knew lens hood! 
9303 Pretty new, so no qualitative evaluation I can provide yet. Looks good and worked perfectly so far. 
9304 When I bought this as a stand alone wireless camera and it was no such thing. This camera is an add on to a system that has a special screen and receiver. 
9305 Good 
9306 App wouldn t work. 
9307 highly recomend it. It works great with my nikon d3200. 
9308 This didn t last very long. I purchased it in mid Feb 2015 and had to replace it by August because i it was very dim. It started out ok. 
9309 It s out of this world it is unbelievable lens every shut I take the pictures come out beautiful so I recommend whoever buys his lens they getting their moneys worth and that s all I have to say 
9310 A perfect replacement. 
9311 Good product. Very happy with purchase. 
9312 Tip kept coming off and was lost after the 2nd day. Poor quality, junk. 
9313 very good and fast service would order again 
9314 Just had it professionally installed for it to not even work! it looked legit and brand new so never thought about asking them to test it first. 
9315 I really love the soft focus and star filter. Very high quality for the price and I highly recommend for amateur/hobby photographers. 
9316 Very hard to pull the spring open to fit my phone in it. 
9317 Top seller, very impressed with prompt delivery,item as described by seller, recommend to all. Thank you, will buy again. 
9318 As expected 
9319 Used on Alaska cruise. Very satisfied. 
9320 Cute unit, PA crap, NO WHERE CLOSE TO 100 watt power 
9321 Nice camera. Takes great photos and also nice videos. Used it on a trip to Ireland and lots of people were envious of me when I started taking videos of people dancing in an Irish pub. 
9322 Great affordable camera grip for videos 
9323 love it 
9324 Perfect fit and excellent value 
9325 good price 
9326 Very expensive but very well made and a must for leveling cameras on tripods without a leveling bowl. 
9327 these clips are so strong they will take the him off the side of our screen if you pull them that hard. So nice to be able to get the screen as tight as I want without having them pull off. 
9328 Works like a charm! I was previously using my canon flash without this hot shoe adapter and it would not make a good connection when I changed my angle and not flash. Now, works perfectly every time. 
9329 Light yet burly. Great for extreme skiing. 
9330 The concept of great, but after receiving the holders, I discovered I have to remove the lens cap first, if I want to add or remove the lens hood. 
9331 very good 
9332 Perfect size. Good quality. 
9333 Great customer service! They will strive to take care of you. Solid construction. A great value for the price! 
9334 The product came quickly and works as it should. Run time is the same or maybe a little longer than the factory battery. 
9335 It works really well. Went and bought another. 
9336 It does not work 
9337 the ac adapter is broke and they just keep telling they are out of them to wait. it has been 3 months 
9338 Focus pretty fast and quiet. 
9339 Can t tell the difference between this and a regular tv picture from the outside of the house. Great job whoever invented this thing. 
9340 Work good 
9341 Pictures look great ! 
9342 Light weight - but very good distance vision capability. Easy to adjust. 
9343 Works great. I like using this better than my helmet mount. 
9344 Love it! It would be five stars if it had longer battery life. Tons of great functions, apps and more... My best camera ever! 
9345 Even has night vision in the house Easy to install Had to buy 100 ft extension cables to use outside 
9346 great! 
9347 Decent quality. The best part is that most of these items are small and easy to put into your camera bag without taking up too much space. 
9348 its works fine. 
9349 It was late but that s my only real issue with it. I would have liked it if it came with a fur more extra screws but for the price it s okay. 
9350 Lots of room for lots of accessories and the cam - good product. 
9351 Fast delivery, easy to put on and take off. Use it mainly for lense protection 
9352 Exceptional 
9353 Fast shipping works excellent 
9354 The charger works, but it is very difficult to attach it to the battery. The first time I tried, I broke off the little plastic part that is intended to hold it in place. 
9355 was the right size, worked great. Have had it for almost 2 months, and it quit working. paid $138 for a monitor to work for 2 months. It is past the returns 30 day window so amazon is saying no refund or exchange. Very unsatisfied. 
9356 Some parts broke after use , some are working ok 
9357 good choice well worth the money. 
9358 huhh, it s alright tiny! 
9359 Worked great with our Intvo a camera. We dove at Key Largo, Florida and recommended the floats after a fellow diver dropped his GoPro while climbing back into the boat. 
9360 Nice lol gadget 
9361 Always the highest quality for the price. 
9362 Everything you expect from Domke. Well made, well thought out, reasonably priced. I have half a dozen Domke bags, have for years, and no other bag has served me nearly as well 
9363 This is the best camera I have ever had. So easy to use, I love the instant pictures. Fun to share with friends. Love it. 
9364 Excellent 
9365 Works ... its just a battery ....... Not prime rib dinner ! 
9366 I am using it on a flip flash bracket. It s the perfect length! It s holding the flash very well and I have yet to have any issues after using it for a few weeks. 
9367 Item arrived as promised. Batteries and charger work great. The cleaning supplies are a good bonus. The price is great! I recommend this product to anyone looking to buy extra batteries for their camera. Works great with a canon rebel t3i. 
9368 This is my first flash and it is perfect! 
9369 It was good as it was supposed to. 
9370 did not work, returned 
9371 Perfect camera. Takes excellent pictures. I have been able to capture birds in flight from quite a distance, which is exactly why I purchased the camera. Shutter speed is exactly as manufacture describes. 
9372 Suction Cup is amazing the arm is very versatile! 
9373 Quality just wasnt there, Returned it. 
9374 Good product for the price. 
9375 terrible 
9376 Product was as advertised. 
9377 Enjoy thid item 
9378 Beautiful beads. I absolutely love them, actually want another set. Thank you. 
9379 Works just fine and is easy to use. A good purchase. 
9380 Fits all my stuff, just a couple inches more would have made it great. 
9381 Best camera purchase yet! 
9382 One of my six units quit working after only 3 weeks, I contacted the seller and they said to send back the intercom that doesn t work at MY EXPENSE. 
9383 It works, but I m not blown away. I like the form factor. GREAT size and VERY convenient that it folds away. 
9384 Very good service I m happy 
9385 Leaking - will be returning for refund. Maybe I just got a dud? 
9386 Very nice comfy strap. 
9387 Very good product 
9388 Keeps my drive protected. Has room for papers or anything else plus the cord. 
9389 It is more than I expected 
9390 Just what I needed to convert my mount for my contour 
9391 works great. 
9392 This camera worked one time, first timeIhave been disappointed with an item I bought on Amazon. 
9393 So nice to have when out and about, can carry around neck without bulk, or protects camera when putting it in a bigger bag. 
9394 Essential tool for serious photographers when editiing their photos either on Mac or Windows. Sensor is much smaller than on previous versions and technical support is outstanding. 
9395 Great product works with my mobile phone remotely great just wish it was HD 
9396 Should have known better, for the price, it is exactly what I should have expected. 
9397 The Q-See cameras I installed are working great.I believe everyone should have them at their residence. Q-See products deliver what they promise. 
9398 I ll never use a sandbag again! 
9399 Nuce 
9400 Thank you 
9401 Great service. Works well and easy to take on trip. 
9402 With this bag I am actually using my camera more. I can get my camera out and put it back without ever setting the bag down. I prefer this over a backpack style bag. 
9403 Helmet mount worthless so much for getting footage of Sturgis don t waste your money buy a gopro 
9404 Excellent lens. Perfoms as stated. 
9405 Works great. i might have to get another one. 
9406 This is junk 
9407 I got this but soon realized that, I don t typically want to share a photo with anyone/anything before editing it a bit in Photoshop. So...not really using it at the moment. I did a small amount if testing and I had no problems with it. 
9408 Worked great. I mounted it on a vertical bar in an aerobatic airplane when I had my first lesson doing spins, rolls and loops. If is stays in place doing that, it should withstand most bicycle maneuvers 
9409 quick delivery perfect quality 
9410 I no longer own this camera. It has a propensity of shutting in mid use. 
9411 This is the second unit I bought to give as gifts. Copter can take some crashes without any damage, For the money I think this is a good deal for the price.. 
9412 Absolutely worth every penny! 
9413 The Monopod Tripod Mount is a perfect product for mounting you device on a selfie stick or any type of tripod. It is a perfect accessory for capturing those memorable moments in life. I love using it on my selfie stick to create family videos. 
9414 Works great!! Unfortunately, it doesn t come with the &#34;J-Hook&#34; so you can mount your Go Pro Camera. (I have a Go Pro 2) Not a big deal though. There are plenty of places that sell it on Amazon. Fast shipping. Good pprice. 
9415 i Received a power2000 charger XP-333-29 with four 2900 MAH rechargeable batteries, which is a good deal, Although I did not receive the one picured in the ad, I am satisfied as I said before, and no further action need be taken 
9416 Does exactly what it should and does it well. 
9417 Works just as described by others. See the Flickr pool for this lens for examples of what it can/cannot do. 
9418 Great product! 
9419 Great product. Been working on 16 CH system with no issues. A+ 
9420 using for my 10x nd filter 
9421 Too thin 
9422 I like this product and will buy again. 
9423 This is a great lens cap. Ruged material and fits my canon SX 40HS perfectly. I highly recommend it. 
9424 These are pretty cool, great picture, easy install. The toggle adjustment switch was just a little problem getting into 1/2 conduit sleeve to hide in gang box outside. Otherwise, happy with purchase! 
9425 I love the filter, but find it difficult to get on and off the lens. 
9426 There is only one word for this product.....AWESOME! 
9427 Convenient, inexpensive and easy to use. 
9428 Glass was flawed with a discolored spot within the middle third of the filter. Rendered unusable. Should have been a rejected product. 
9429 This adapter is a great buy. I allowed me to really explore my camera and what it can do. Before this purchase I had to rush and get pictures taken before the batteries ran down. Now I can take my time. 
9430 Great package of accessories for the GoPro! 
9431 really good buy and excellent transmission capabilities, made four odd lengths from 100 
9432 great for small scale usage 
9433 just nice to have a back up battery. 
9434 This tripod would not seat my camera firmly against the base, effectively making it useless. The screw to attach the camera was did not have long enough threads to pull the camera tight. It wobbled like crazy even when screwed all the way in. This was with my Pentax K-50. 
9435 Quit funtionjng after a week! 
9436 The video sunglasses mp3 
9437 Is not working. 
9438 They never worked I m so upset, I ve bought different spyglasses and have worked well, but this purchase was sadly a mistake. 
9439 Thank you! 
9440 This charger is like none other. More powerful than even the product instructions describe. A must have!!! David 
9441 Works Great just as it should Thanks 
9442 Worked perfect 
9443 A lot better than using plus filters. Able to use on all lenses. 
9444 so far, so good. came very fast. 
9445 Very fast delivery .. It s my husbands 60 th birthday present 
9446 He hasn t seen yet but I m sure he will be thrilled 
9447 Really Handy to get extra batteries. So small and easy to store. 
9448 Works as Expected. 
9449 Arrived with a broken plastic clip rail, so I had to tape the battery in while it charged. 
9450 nice quality, works great 
9451 Works as advertised, works fine. The picture above shows the wrong connector, its actually silver and fits fine with the Nikon D3100. 
9452 Takes great clear pictures. Takes a bit of work to figure out all the settings. 
9453 Super great bag, Solid and well padded. It does come with a shoulder strap. Compartments for other accessories as well. 
9454 Easy to use, Very light , all weather functional , nice video quality 
9455 Excellent. Just what I needed for the look and feel. See Ba Ba Black Sheep, for yourself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpBifyjcsSE 
9456 These work great and price is right. 
9457 The motion sensor doesn t work at night, so it won t record until ur literally waving your arms Update: 6 months later The recording device crapped out. It no longer records or functions. New rating would be 1 star 
9458 Good camera system 
9459 This is the second time I have bought this assortment. Still 110% pleased!! 
9460 Great case, hard to keep GoPro protected 
9461 It is inexpensive, attaches easily and does the job. 
9462 works fine if you want to carry that much weight. the housing where you place the batteries though looks & feels cheap like it can break any minute. 
9463 Haven t had to use it. 
9464 I purchased this monocular for my husband. He loves it. He only has one good eye so binoculars are not useful. This Polar Explorer is perfect. Also, it was delivered as promised in perfect condition. The price was right. Will definitely use this supplier for future such purchases. 
9465 Nice bag, bought it as a gift for my wife for her new camera. Very happy with it. 
9466 Fits fine on a my Fujifilm pancake lens. 
9467 Not as described at all. Seller did make up for it! 
9468 Ok 
9469 Hoya filters are very reliable. Have several Hoya filters and have always had great results. 
9470 Excellent 
9471 The hood doesn t fit properly on my Pentax lens. 
9472 I am still trying to figure out why I bought this. It has all kinds of fancy programs that I will never use and some of my outdoor picks haven t captured the detail correctly. Personally I don t leave a camera outside all night to take star pictures. 
9473 I use this tripod and phone attachment with my iPhone 6. It is easy to attach to the back of a chair or to stand on a table. It s lightweight and easily fits in my bag with the legs flattened together. 
9474 NO WHERE in the advertising did it say for GoPro 3 or earlier models. Does not work with any GoPro 4. Huge disappointment. 
9475 perfect for the Phantom and accessories 
9476 Good purchase. Same as other more expensive camara, but for way less. I recommed it. 
9477 Good camera for the price. 
9478 works great 
9479 good product 
9480 very compact , great resolution for a kit lens, 
9481 The frame lasted as long as the time that it was too late to return, 
9482 Very well made for the price. Panning is very smooth because they have added grease to it which you can see and slightly hear when panning but that is fine with me. 
9483 Great deal, I wanna order more 
9484 Unit does what it was designed to do and I like it a lot. Was a bit disappointing with how weak the edge support is, but overall works fine. 
9485 Excellent package! Get it!! 
9486 Sold to a friend, still work till this day. 
9487 It s a great case. I can fit a lot of basic accessories in it. Definitely nothing too long though. 3 way fits in it. The material is good quality. No need to purchase the expensive one from gopole. 
9488 Premium price for a good product. I bought the lanyard kit to hold this unit. I feel a fair price would have included the lanyard/ mounting kit. 
9489 Too complicated for me. I thought it was Wireless so there would be no wired connections 
9490 Only wanted one set of two but must have double ordered as I got and paid for two sets 
9491 very nice! 
9492 works as described. 
9493 We are very impressed with this system. 
9494 The Nikon binoculars are excellent. The optics are clear and offer sharp magnification yet is easily handheld for a steady image. Low light performance is great. The rubber finish provides excellent protection from bumps and moisture gives a secure grip. A really great product. 
9495 helpful 
9496 The tripod is very very cheap. The monopod is fairly good quality. 
9497 It fits perfectly in my Pentax K-50 DSLR camera and the anti-reflective feature works fine and now it is easier see the screen without any light glare. 
9498 Sony recommended website product for a6000. Fits the LCD screen perfectly. 
9499 Timely delivery - they fit 
9500 Have wanted these for years now have them can see what I haven t been able to also easier then a telescope 
9501 Nice and easy to use 
9502 exactly what I needed. 
9503 Terrific quality backdrop. Love the fabric quality! 
9504 This specifies that it fits the Canon PowerShot SX60---it does not. I m hoping that I will be able to return it but have had no response to my inquiry from several weeks ago. 
9505 This is a great, lightweight tripod, for a great price! 
9506 Great deal fast delivery, will buy again when I need more, very good quality! 
9507 Very useful. A little less on the product material quality but for thw price, it is totally reasonable. 
9508 Very well crafted using high quality leather. Good protection and elegant case. A+ 
9509 My gf loves it! Get this one beczuase it has bigger films = bigger picture! :D yay! 
9510 Good product just have to be careful will fall off some belt loops 
9511 arrived in great condition 
9512 Convenient, does what it is supposed to do No problems 
9513 Excellent waterproof case. Hasn t failed me. 
9514 Great functional product but overpriced. 
9515 Product was as advertised. 
9516 Great Product, Just as Described!!! 
9517 I was really impressed with this unit. Very bright. 
9518 Loved the product 
9519 I love them, and the price was a lot less than what I shopped around for. Thank You. Dotty Shartzer 
9520 A good product.. My husband uses when taking pictures for ebay store. 
9521 only worked once or twice 
9522 Awesome and beautifully colored 
9523 The one I received was not silver like the picture but part black and part silver. Was not really happy about that. Should have been all black or all silver. Not a mix 
9524 its a basic bag, replaced it shortly after I got it with a pelican case, this is okay for a cheap camera when you need to save space. 
9525 Camera and associated app work great. I can control the camera rotation remotely and zoom in. I am also able to call the animals over the two way communication. 
9526 Such a cute case I love it so much! Ive had this for a while and it protects my camera. It looks as good as new! 
9527 We have mounted these on a car, been in pools and a lake, zip lining, mountain biking and given the pieces some abuse and nothing has broken. Happy with the purchase and recommend. 
9528 It works good on iphone 5. But i want one for my Lenovo tablet yoga 2 13 
9529 It dosen t work well on the Lenovo tablet and I returned it. 
9530 Ok 
9531 Used about 6 months. Still works good. Only issue is plug in for Google is no longer supported. 8/2015 
9532 Plastic. Cheap. Threw it away. 
9533 Got it Fast! All the items were as noted and loving the little tripod :) what a nice set! Totally recommend you will enjoy. Thanks :) 
9534 AAA 
9535 Works just as described. 
9536 Perfect replacement for OEM Nikon caps. 
9537 Using these with the Envy strap and Uni-loops. Works great. Quick release function is valuable to me. Have been using this system for 15+years, have not had a failure, very little visible wear. 
9538 The best tripod in the price range, you ll get something like this for no less than $300 in another brand, so yeap the best tripod for the money, really solid and usable 
9539 Delivery on times, it worked on my Cannon Camcorder ! 
9540 Quite clear for a cheap fish eye. Fun to play with. With DSLR video, definitely have to watch out for and overexposure at all, any blown out bits are lost even more so with this lens. 
9541 Good item. 
9542 DUDE. This lens. I ve gotten so much use out of this little lens. Night shots? No problem. Portraits of your drunk friends? Got it. Crazy cool lighting/bokeh effects. Absolutely. Super versatile lens for a super nice price. Do it! 
9543 Very good case, wheels work well, zipper a little sticky in one spot but will work itself out I trust. Not a ton of padding or weight, perfect for stands, sliders and tripods. 
9544 Works Great 
9545 This is an excellent case. Very strong study construction. I feel secure in knowing this is protecting my expensive equipment 
9546 Everything about the description of this product is miss leading. Will not purchase from this seller again. The light does not come with AAA batteries and it is only one light. 
9547 Great quality and amazing price !! A small price to pay to protect expensive lenses! 
9548 Didn t realize this existed 
9549 Worked perfectly on my telescope for alignment and leveling. 
9550 It reflects very well. 
9551 Awesome so far... A week in, but best camera strap I ve ever own. 
9552 Essential accessory for framing pictures with a DSLR 
9553 not to shabby, i know this was stupid but if you want this to last please don t take this stick underwater especially salt water 
9554 Does not come with flash 
9555 Great for protecting electronic devices when you re in electronically hostile environments. 
9556 The camera works well enough for the price but the monitor want cut on ..so I just got it hooked to a TV .. 
9557 good stuff 
9558 Everything exceeded my expectations. My friend really loved it and she was able to shoot a wedding that weekend. Keep up the great work. Will be purchasing from again. 
9559 Glad to have them...so useful! 
9560 Arrived on time and as described. I never knew what these were for until I took a photography class. Now I have to get a better tripod so I can take photos of moving water and lightening. Now I can take more art-full pictures. 
9561 tripod will not hold the camera 
9562 Great Product, helps keep all my devices clean 
9563 Delivered on time and fits like my original plate. Feels well constructed. Haven t taken it out for any rigorous shooting yet but it s exactly what I was hoping it would be 
9564 Rotors broke after first use. Charger cable cannot be decoupled so I haven t been able to charge the copter. 
9565 does not work ? 
9566 The TTL function on one of mine doesn t work. Didn t realize till after return window was closed. 
9567 Great transaction and useful bundle - love the camera! Thanks! 
9568 Great kit for flash photo. It creates great atmospheres for your projects. 
9569 Pretty rad deal for a great starter pack. Works well and does what it s supposed to do. Recommended. :^) 
9570 These are perfect...exactly what I was looking for to clean my screens. They work great and are large enough that they don t bunch up in your hands. A couple of swipes and the screen is clean! 
9571 it is a great camera but the lens broke on it 
9572 Very Good 
9573 It s good!! 
9574 I ve used these for my glasses, laptop, phone, and tablet, and I have to say that these cloths are absolutely fantastic. They work well after washing, too! Would definitely recommend. 
9575 Works well. I was able to adhere to side panel of window and get closer to the glass, as you can remove the bulky harness from dropcam. 
9576 Works perfectly. Kept our camera secure on the dash. 
9577 Excellent adjustment range and height for table top use. Very stable and sturdy. This a the best tripod I have ever bought. 
9578 Love it! No more losing lens covers! 
9579 Great Product 
9580 So cool and very amazing camera,I love it sososo much and take many beautiful photos to my friends 
9581 Great little camera at a great price, came with factory packing and am very happy with it. 
9582 Razor sharp views. Star test best I have seen. I ditched the stock diagonal though. 
9583 Love em.. 
9584 unit arrived with loose plastic pieces inside. I had to take cover off to discover what was moving aro0und inside. 
9585 Works Great, as advertised 
9586 Just what the doctor ordered! 
9587 super good tripod. especially for the price 
9588 Battery not detected by Nikon D5300. It was also slightly thicker than OEM making it harder to install/remove from battery tray. Rapid blinking LED when trying to charge with OEM charger. 
9589 Ordered this product for my granddaughter because she loves takin pictures and its time to restock for the school year. 
9590 works great thanks 
9591 Excelente 
9592 using it with my wireless intercom. worked as expected for a great price 
9593 Love this case! 
9594 Received shipment missing the wall charger. However, the batteries came fully charged and worked well. Returned item. 
9595 May not be the cadillac of binoculars but for someone who wants great distance with very good clarity and does not want to break the bank - these are a winner. 
9596 Great product and prompt shipment! Thanks!! 
9597 I bought two extra cameras to go with the GE Wireless Color Digital Home Monitoring Camera LCD Monitor Security Kit 45255. They paired up great with the reciever. Going to buy a 4th, just to see what our dogs do when were not home :) 
9598 Awesome case for the price. Used it for my knife collection. Very high quality 
9599 Garbage and really messes with your camera I can t even use it 
9600 had problems getting it to thread with my UV filter but after a few tries it fitted 
9601 awsome camcorder for the price, easy to use and much smaller than expected, great battery life and well worth buying extra batterys for longer use. if your also gonna take alot of pics with it I found its best to buy a good hd card for good clear pics. 
9602 Excellent package. Coming from a Canon to pro Nikon is proving to be challenging.Having trouble with misfires when taking photos 
9603 Takes great photos - nothing spectacular - but brought this camera with my on a trip to Venice Italy. Did the trick and if I lost it on my travels it would have been no big deal. My keepsake photos from the trip are gorgeous. 
9604 Great camera for price!!! 
9605 worked for my basic needs 
9606 I bought these to use with my backup release plates. They help to tighten the plate easier. No tools required. 
9607 Awesome!!! 
9608 Thank you! This came exactly as described, very quickly. Overall wonderful experience 
9609 Fantastic little thing. Built well and the head is more secure on it than my legs. Perfect for any tripod without a bowl or other head leveling options. 
9610 Great product. Works so much better then others I have tried. I m very surprised that I didn t have any problems.Easy quick and simple.The cloud is kool. You don t need a memory card. 
9611 I love this camera pictures are excellent I love my purchase. 
9612 Forgot this back in my hotel room so I have yet to field test. Seems to be a quality product so far. 
9613 Doubles your battery life. Easy to use and it comes with 4 back doors for new and old cameras. Comes with carrying case too! 
9614 poor picture quality not worth it. save your cash. 
9615 I can t live without this thing. Looks like Tupperware, works like magic. Love the straps at the base that keeps it from falling off. 
9616 Could never get it to work with SmartThings. 
9617 I needed a mount that can support a gopro or contour when recording video while driving and this head exceeded my expectation. I was also able to use a Sony A6000 attached to this ball head without fear of the camera coming off the mount while driving. 
9618 Works well. As noted previously, a little blurry around the edges. 
9619 Dont waste your money 
9620 They do what they are supposed to do, also very corrosion resistant. A season in the pool, and they have yet to show any shots of corrosion starting. 
9621 Nice build up .value for money.unfotunately its not combatablr with my canon eos100 
9622 worked well for NEX 6000 
9623 The lens caps fit perfectly and seem to be of good quality. I am satisfied with this purchase. 
9624 One notch too expensive (99$US), but its the only show in town that works snug and solid for the lenses used here. 
9625 Using this with a SONY A7 and things function as well. The lenses work manually fyi those who might not know. 
9626 good 
9627 More sensitive than expected. Cranky mssg. set up, once set it works. I use it in an area with less shadows from bright windows in the day - that said, because as I said, it is that sensitive. Beat it at the price, I do not think so! 
9628 Ok 
9629 Exactly what I expected and wanted. Based on others feedback of the savage swatches, I do agree the actual paper was lighter then pictures but it s close. I d say it s just not as rich. Good quality and packaged to support the large heavy roll. 
9630 good price and product. 
9631 Don t waist your money 
9632 did not work need original lamp 
9633 too small for the olympus tough TG-860 
9634 Got them in only 1 day worked good 
9635 Good camera just a bit hard to edit the file format. 
9636 works great, delivered quickly! 
9637 nothing much to say about this one, it s a lens cap that fits. 
9638 The detector installed reasonably easily and has been working very well for the last 2 months. 
9639 THIS DOES NOT WORK. Its super cheap, and it doesnt work. At all. 
9640 Exactly what I had ordered and expected. 
9641 Good! No problems. 
9642 Came quick and is fun to use 
9643 couldnt get this to work. great design but wont work. 
9644 Can t believe how much gear I can get into the bag. I think it will be a great addition to my photographic equipment. 
9645 Amazing camera! Super easy to use love it:) came in great condition 
9646 it is ok, nothing special. it looks used, was not as new 
9647 So cute & fun! We re having a blast capturing memories with this awesome camera! 
9648 work ok for my CCTV cams 
9649 This case is great to keep up with everything, since the goPro does not come with a case I usually just kept it in a plastic bag and did not have a central place to keep it. So now I store everything together and it is great to travel with. 
9650 Well-ordered this battery as a backup for my Sony point and shoot camera. But this little guy just stopped working. Has just over one year. The original battery that I have still works. Will not buy again. Waste of money. 
9651 great lens! DOF & low light gem 
9652 Great set! 
9653 Works well. I use this with the underwater housing and swim with it. Stays nice and tight. 
9654 Works well as a trainer for a better quadcopter. Its very fun to use but the camera stopped working after about 2 flights. Looks like it was supposed to take OK video but it broke after an hour of owning it. 
9655 cheapest good cable and it works great 
9656 very very good 
9657 great deal 
9658 Works great with my Nexus 7 ii and the phantom 3 pro controller. 
9659 Great product at good price 
9660 awesome 
9661 WILL NOT STAY ON-LINE. DLINK SYSTEM IS HORRIBLE. CUSTOMER SERVICE SPEAKS HARDLY ANY ENGLISH 
9662 Does what it s supposed to do. Simple as that. 
9663 PERFECT 
9664 Everything that you would expect about this waterproof box for the GoPro 3 is exactly as it should be.It s an exact match to my official Gopro case. I would order again if I need another one. 
9665 It s good 
9666 Excellent item! 
9667 Corners match size but sides are concaved and do not fit. 
9668 Not ok you can see black parts on the videos and pictures due to wide angke 
9669 Great Product 
9670 great 
9671 I ve used it for a more than a week and it is excellent! Even able to check in while on the road and speak through the camera -- using it for elderly parents as a monitor and it s fantastic. Night time vision works -- all very good. Excellent! 
9672 Great product! Very easy to set up. 
9673 Good to have a working remote again. Took a second to figure the pairing out, but it works well. 
9674 I shoot formal and concert events and this battery worked great for TWO long events (6-7 hours total) and still had power to go. I own 2 of these just in case but I couldn t believe how long this one lasted. Highly recommend!! 
9675 Be very careful I ordered this and missed the return date by 1day. This item stop working with in the fist week of use!!!! Only a 30 day return window! 
9676 Great camera. The design is improved over the dropcam. Better mount and software. 
9677 To small in length in my opinion. Looks weird when you a wearing it. It s just really small and but pops out on your back. 
9678 terrible. doesn t fit fuji battery or batteries that came with it, which were both dead. 
9679 Brand new in the Canon box. Good and solid lens hood. Great seller. 
9680 Don t buy this bag, the straps break easily and it s poorly-made. 
9681 Amazing lens, it improves the quality of my pictures and add fantastic effects on them. 
9682 Just learning how to use this camera, but so far it meets expectations. Easy to use but has a lot of settings enhance my photography. Perfect first DSLR camera, especially since older lenses from my dad s camera will fit. 
9683 This cleaning kit is really good and a great value! 
9684 Does the adapter ring come with this kit, if not this is impossible to assemble without it ref; Es-470 lite and soft box kit, I need help Very nice kit 
9685 This is a great little camera. The LCD makes it easy to see what you are doing. Only big issues are the battery life, but you can buy a battery pack and double the time. It is fine. 
9686 I like it 
9687 I think this is really solid, I used it on my vlog - you can see footage of it in use, even underwater: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl-lKaFfe4I 
9688 Great camera --- transferring pictures from camera to cellphone or computer is a snap 
9689 Very Good Product 
9690 It is well constructed.. If you carry a camera and one lens or flash, it would work great. I normally carry two lenses and a flash. The bag is to small for that. 
9691 Selfie stick does not fit properly 
9692 Reliable 
9693 Makes handling longer lenses much easier to handle and when using the video function I can improve how steady I hold the camera. 
9694 the best product 
9695 Really pleased with it 
9696 a pretty good case. I love it. 
9697 If the camera lens on your phone isn t in the middle of the phone it doesn t line up. Even if it did work well it isn t worth the price. 
9698 Didn t work as advertised, there was no sound and it wouldn t record. Returned for refund. 
9699 Very pleased with this product. Up until I got this for my Canon 3ti, I was extremely disappointed in my indoor pictures with this camera. WOW! what a difference this flash attachment has made. Just wished I would have found it a year ago! 
9700 Great buy! Hope it holds up 
9701 good pics, but didn t realize unitl I received it that it required AA batteries. As result, it doesn t last long with constant use. 
9702 A very good middle gray for photography. Great product and got here on time. 
9703 this unit works just great, better than the original one I had 
9704 Great straps. These distribute the load much better than the straps that come with most cameras and the padding and stretch helps a lot too. Easy to snap on and off as well for tripod work. 
9705 It s not universal if the platform is too small to fit even the smallest DSLR. 
9706 Not much to say, it works great protecting my new lens and it s a great price. 
9707 Great little camera, the only thing I do not like is it sends an alert every time there is moment in the room, however by the time I receive the alert, there is nothing in the room anymore. Trying to get this fixed. 
9708 does the job. exactly what I expected it to do. 
9709 No útil 
9710 Unfortunately overpriced.... but I purchased one and fixed up my Phantom 2 Vision + good as new. 
9711 When you have an older camera and you lose cords or other pieces, it can be frustrating to find a replacement. In this instance, it was no problem and this Battery charger is the perfect replacement. 
9712 I love them they are very nice 
9713 bought it and the problem moved away 
9714 Great camera bag pack for a small trips 
9715 Used for our cruise and it was perfect! If you have any doubt cast it aside. 
9716 Just what I wanted 
9717 Excellent body or vehicle cam for the price. Remote and all the mounting accessories complete the package deal. 
9718 Slim profile. 60mm+ length is ideal for vertical orientation support. Well machined surface and contours. Construction seems robust enough. A great value when compared to similar QR plates costing 2 to 3x more. 
9719 This camera goes through batteries way too fast. It is difficult to change the settings and switch from photo to video, but very easy to accidentally delete your photos. 
9720 No memory card in packaging 
9721 This lens hood does not fit well on Canon EFS 18-55 mm 3.5 -5.6 lens. Buyer beware. 
9722 Extremely tight fit. Had to force it on the flash unit. It works otherwise. 
9723 I absolutely LOVE this camera and the company shipped extremely fast. 
9724 I reserved the the battery pack and itself works fine but I reserved the baking for a go pro hero 3+ and it does not fit onto my gopro hero3 white housing. 
9725 Good Design. Once balanced overall feels good. Very solid construction. Most definitely feels like a durable product. Price is more than fair 
9726 Works Fine 
9727 Bought a used Nikon Coolpix S3600 to replace a broken point-and-shoot. Picture quality and features are excellent for a point-and-shoot. The only negative I ve found so far is that battery life is average compared to other battery packs for other cameras that I own. 
9728 Catch broke off first time I opened it do leg would not extend. It also did not mount camera on the level. Not fit for purpose 
9729 Solid construction. Very sturdy and included an extention section to extend it s reach. Works great to hold my camera equipment while working and tinkering with remote cameras and FPV equipment. 
9730 Big bag - holds all my gear with room left over. Seems sturdy enough! 
9731 Great thin pen, writes wonderful no skipping and the autopoint touch screen end worked on my broken phone screen when my fingers would not do it. I would buy this and give as christmas gifts, graduation gifts or any gift. Highly recommend! © 2015 Jackie Paulson 
9732 I really liked the camara 
9733 Works great 
9734 Nice looking however the batteries we are going through is ridiculous! We have bought rechargeable now yet we are recharging every two days? 
9735 Good 
9736 Great! 
9737 Works fine The battery that came with camera didn t last very long at all. but now I can charge and has a long life. 
9738 I like the slik quick release plate system. It is a very solid mount on the tripod even with heavy long lenses and spotting scopes 
9739 This is such a great tiny adapter...that works amazingly....Love it and would recommend! It is tiny but it works!!!! 
9740 Broke the side door within 3min of opening the package. 
9741 Excellent 
9742 exelente producto gracias 
9743 Perfect, as I expected 
9744 These adapters fit the Sony a3000 and the kit lens perfectly. These even have the Sony logo on them, they look exactly like OEM ones I also have. 
9745 Was delivered in time it work fine satisfied 
9746 Excellent camera for the price takes great pictures! 
9747 I did not buy this 
9748 I like the camera but didn t came if a book to show me how run the camera plus itthought it came with a card. 
9749 This is a very lousy product for the price. The image during the day is to overexposed when recording and the unit itself lasted about a week and a half before it died. For 140 dollars you can get yourself a way better camera than this marked up Chinese junk. 
9750 excelente 
9751 A very sturdy, lightweight tripod that works best with smaller cameras, and easy to operate. 
9752 Excellent. Works well with all my sunglasses. 
9753 Too Loud. No Volume Control. Otherwise, works as expected. The lack of volume control makes these useless to me though. 
9754 Didn t work -_- 
9755 Very strong magnet...stays put and gets the job done... 
9756 I love it!!! It fits well with my fujifilm camera and it s adorable. I would totally recommend it. 😍 
9757 Perfect fit. 
9758 Works great 
9759 Nice bag 
9760 Does the job exactly as advertised 
9761 Good lenses and a great company. I look forward to my next purchase. 
9762 Excellent merchant. Items ordered came exactly as listed. ☺ 5 ★ STARS ★ Thanks! 
9763 classy and small enough to carry in purse, lap top carrier 
9764 Works Great 
9765 Fantastic camera. Good quality and comes with a lot more things in the box than my fathers go pro did. Battery life is good and the camera is easy to use. Especially with the remote. I will never buy another helmet cam without a remote like this one. 10/10 
9766 it broke the first time I wanted to use it, bad quality. 
9767 Worked exactly how it s supposed to. 
9768 Good cameras that are VERY easy to install and operate. Great price too. 
9769 These products were reliable and affordable. I recommend buying it. 
9770 this is a fraud, doesn´t work, dont wast money buying this crap 
9771 This reflector/diffuser is perfect. Frame is sturdy and easy to assemble and disassemble. This is quickly becoming my go to lighting tool. 
9772 My go to lens. 
9773 Replaced the battery in a small cordless screwdriver, and good as new! 
9774 affordable and does the trick 
9775 Stopped working after a couple of months 
9776 Delivery was really fast and the lens seems to work great, but it was not clean and that is the only drawback. 4 out of 5 stars! Thanks! 
9777 Much better than the ones I purchased from someone else before. It is also better than the original Panasonic battery 
9778 Nice knock-off and good price - can t wait to take it underwater in Cozumel in October. 
9779 It fit my lens perfectly!!! 
9780 Nest Cam protects my private space/life to a certain extent. Those who prey into other people s life/business are less likely to act ruthless when they know they can be caught in camera. 
9781 As advertised. 
9782 I love it !! its excellent quality and versatil. 
9783 These won t keep a decent charge, won t power anything that has a motor or flash. only good for remotes... very disappointed with them. 
9784 Picture quality not so good unable to view objects when digital zoom, picture real grainy at Nite 
9785 [[VIDEOID:faa7d83e1f0a9dd702f4f483ad2daa85]] Grip works great for me. Not too heavy but does t feel puny like a selfie stick. Probably best for GoPro sized cameras. I tries to put the Panasonic GH4 on it and it was too big. Quick release works great- no issues with mine. 
9786 My GoPro didn t sink. Count it! 
9787 Mom loves her 
9788 Nice and simple to installed 
9789 Convenient way to clean your keyboard. Seems to be pretty effective, at least compared to compressed air. I haven t compared them directly, so I can t say for certain, but this seems to get the job done. 
9790 Works perfect just as described! 
9791 The program sent with this scanner does not work very well. I have to keep opening and closing it to get it to copy the pictures into my computer. 
9792 good product. design needs improvement already broke one trying to unattached it. 
9793 It s good enough to give the original battery time to fully charge. 
9794 It doesn t zoom in as much or clear enough. 
9795 works great, highly recommend! 
9796 the package was good it was all amazing 
9797 it did the job as decribed 
9798 Great product, highly recommended , simple set up and excellent viewing video. True WIFI operation. 
9799 Looks like a nice product but the (3-D) part is a stretch. Just a raised bump around the edge from die cutting it. I needed something thicker 
9800 Zipper pull was off when it arrived and it is VERY small. I should have gotten the medium size. But this is good for taking a limited amount of accessories. 
9801 This was a gift for two young girls, age 6 and 9. The nine year old turned 10 recently and they used this booth and disguises to have for a sleepover and party; I ve been told it was a blast! 
9802 Purchased for a friend s D3200, He loves it 
9803 Henry at FosCam support was very patient as we worked thru some setup issues. The camera image looks great and I am very happy with the purchase.Thanks again Henry. 
9804 The items are great. Unfortunately, I ordered the wrong part number DNS the battery does not fit. I m not sure how to request an exchange. 
9805 I have bought several of these wireless IP cams. The Loftek and the Astak. This is by far the best one. Great picture quality, easy set up, DDNS built in so you can view from outside your network. Will by more. 
9806 my all time favorite camera. I think it is a little better than the mini *. But it works great! 
9807 Amazing package! You ll get everything you need!!!!! 
9808 Serves the purpose well. UV cleans relatively easily. CP without distortion but not particularly smooth and a bit touchy to screw on. Haven t used the ND yet. Overall very good for the price. 
9809 Very poor Quality 
9810 It s great for the price but I ordered black and got a white backdrop. I don t even have time to exchange it so thanks, I guess I need to find another option quick. At least I have a white back drop for future use. 
9811 I ve used this item once so far and it seems to be just what I was looking for. Thank you. 
9812 Battery never worked so haven t been able to test it. 
9813 Great assortment of accessories for Go Pro at a good price. Way cheaper than buying separately. 
9814 Looks good, sturdy material and will work well. Looking forward to using it 
9815 Excellent product !!! Does the job perfectly, Big enough to picture almost everything, even an open carriage THANKS!! 
9816 It s a screw for God s sake, it works as described and expected. 
9817 A wonderful product! I love being able to capture portraits of strangers for a project I work on and give them a print as a thank you in return. This stuff is great. 
9818 These are awesome. They slide a little rough and occasionally get stuck, but if you have patience, they are well worth the money. If you re just doing a bit of macro shots, don t buy the expensive stuff. These work just fine! 
9819 So far so good 
9820 Very quick delivery and easy to set up. 
9821 wrist strap came off 
9822 Great product 
9823 We re so pleased with our purchase. Perfect camera bag for our camera, the stands are easy to use and sturdy. Everything in our starter kit is just what we needed.. Thank you again Amazon!!! 
9824 The kit is good , but the selfie stick broke the first time it was used. i hope the rest of the pieces last longer than it did. 
9825 This camera does a great job. After initial setup, I had to change routers and their customer service walked me through the setup revisions. 
9826 Very, very good picture--but a bit slow 
9827 Fast shipping and this is an overall excellent camera. 
9828 This seller sent me a bunch of useless filters but not the lens cap as advertised. Wont recommend it. 
9829 Worked better than I thought and it kept my camera from going to the bottom of my pool. 
9830 bit small...but works 
9831 excellent value 
9832 Cleans me screens and glasses. Can t ask for anything else. 
9833 Worked Great. Amazon was the only place I could find a replacement cable. 
9834 Very convenience, but the sound is terrible 
9835 Solid! A few people complained about set up etc but I think this ting is just phenomenal! I am SUPER happy with the purchase to the point that I keep it in my trunk along with my lights at all times! No extra weight or stand bags needed! 
9836 Exactly as described and good delivery time. 
9837 I had a similar experience. Although I purchased this camera a few years ago, as a birthday gift for my son, we barely used it 3-5 times. The &#34;on&#34; button does not work, and the &#34;play&#34; button remains lit, but nothing plays as the screen is black. Totally disappointed. 
9838 Easy to set up and install. Works perfectly for our monitoring purposes. Highly recommend this product. 
9839 The best camera and value package on the market. 
9840 I tried several different types of straps and the head strap seems to work the best. The only downside is that when I take it off, I end up with unsightly &#34;GoPro&#34; hair. 
9841 My daughter loved 
9842 Came fast and worked great! 
9843 Really like this kit, but I would prefer for the flat pen to be squared or in triangle shaped as it would do a better job when cleaning both the viewfinder and the LCD screen. Other than that, perfect. 
9844 A terrific camera. While physicallly small and easy to use, it is packed full of state of the art features. Extremely pleased with it. 
9845 I don t know how I m suppose to rate something if I haven t took it out it s box yet.this why I gave 3 stars 
9846 I am very happy with the build quality of this little tripod. Tough, stable. A real tripod in miniature. Fun colors and multiple uses. 
9847 Can you tell me how to activate the function &#34;Image size&#34;? This function is currently disabled. Thank you 
9848 Great kit for the price!!! Everything fits, nothing was broken, and it arrived quickly!!! 
9849 What a great packaged deal! Fast shipping. Have not any problems at all. Phantom is a jewel to fly. Pics and video are superb!! Buy with confidence 
9850 Excellent underwater all purpose point and shoot. Camera is easy to operate and takes great pictures. 
9851 It is a nice piece of equipment for a reasonable cost! I m a photographer looking to make a transition to video / short films for myself and my clients. Excellent customer service, too! :) 
9852 Worked great for GPS units. 
9853 Seems to provide the protection I was seeking. 
9854 very good I love it. 
9855 They simply don´t work. I want a refound. I already tried to do EVERYTHING to make them work, i tried in different areas with different internet conexion. The light always stay yellow and never changes to blue. 
9856 They are huge-- listed as compact binoculars, they are anything but compact. 
9857 Awesome bundle package. Camera is great and has many useful settings. Easy to use right out of the box. Comes with a wide variety of accessories that are all very useful. 
9858 fits the bill nicely 
9859 I love this GoPro, and I use it all the time, especially when on vacation down the shore. 
9860 Nice 
9861 Does the job, creates some great photos. Only reason its not a 5 is because I have a b and w 
9862 Good Product Works as expected 
9863 Great lens! It rained the day I bought it, so wanted to try out some rain droplet macro shots. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do! 
9864 great product 
9865 Ok seems a bit flimsy..but ok for the cost...good number of pockets... 
9866 Did not work at all. Gave a two star because the return process was easy. The price seemed to good to be true and it was. 
9867 I m very disappointed with this strap. It s super cute in the picture and looks long. I got it in the mail and extended it and the tiny black string is so small and is longer then the actual strap. 
9868 Didn t work. Don t buy it. 
9869 Work great 
9870 The camera lens is great. I take a lot of large group photos and this lens is super wide. Picture quality is also excellent. 
9871 The product IS GOOD, well made, but it does NOT FIT Manfrotto 501PL Quick Release Plates, unfortunately. I ll try the longer version with less threads on the tip,maybe they work. 
9872 Not well made and it take long time to charge. 
9873 Don t buy unless you don t mind your SD cards falling out of the slots with the slightest jarring. This won t protect your cards as they get bounced around inside the case. 
9874 A little smaller than useful. 
9875 Very good for multiple attachments and rigs. Screw slightly loosens easily no matter how tight you make it. 
9876 Cheap quality 
9877 Very nice 
9878 works for me 
9879 Great buy ... Works great 
9880 I love the Binocular, but what is up with the stupid rain guard on these things? Come on Nikon, it cant cost you that much to include a rain guard that fits. Bought a vortex rain guard and it fits nicely. Everything else is gravy 
9881 Inexpensive and the quality shows. I would not recommend this to a friend. 
9882 very bad. I did not use it. the power is gone after a week. 
9883 Great camera! Replaced an older Nikon model that could not handle newer power hungry lenses. 
9884 Just want a listing of whats inside and how to use each item 
9885 very nice dvr 
9886 Everything came as it is shown. I have not had any problems. I would recommend buying a separate selfie stick, but it works for the price. 
9887 very nice! 
9888 Wonderful flash. I dropped it (on accident of course) And it s still alive, lol. The output is fabulous and definitely saved the outdoor wedding that got moved indoors due to a t-storm. 
9889 Using in Costa Rica now! Great solution to running out of power in the middle of fun. 
9890 I bought this little camera for my Grandson and he loves it! It s simple and shoots pretty OK video. 
9891 Geat so far. I m glad I bought it. 
9892 Seems to be a comprehensive plan at a good price. 
9893 Great i recieve my package own time 
9894 the lenses doesn t fit, and im so disappointed because thats the only thing in the bandle that im so excited about, it say s for instax mini 8, but its small!!! 
9895 sometimes glitches and shows door open when closed, have to open and shut to reset. 
9896 Both caps look and feel very durable. Great price for generic replacements, and both fit snugly. 
9897 great for the price! 
9898 This is a good point and shoot camera for basic needs. There aren t a lot of controls on it, but it does take rather nice pictures. Recommended for simple photography situations that don t call for the need to adjust every last setting. 
9899 Works good with my Nikon camera! 
9900 Not bad for the price, so far works ok 
9901 Never worried about my camera floating to the bottom of the ocean. 
9902 good product 
9903 Perfect!!! 
9904 Great value! It exceeded my expectations. 
9905 Exactly what was needed. My son took the camera on vacation; I ordered the adapter and had it sent to their location. They arrived Sunday and it was delivered Monday. Excellent 
9906 Great easy to attach to the go pro and it latches it very tight 
9907 love it 
9908 Long battery life, used one battery continuously for 2 hours and 45 min. 
9909 Excellent case! Holds all my FPV racing accessories. And the hard shell keeps everything inside secure 
9910 Bought thid for our teenage daughter in addition to the camcorder. She absolutely loves this as it adds a rotating viewfinder to the existing camcorder. Construction is sturdy and installation is super easy! 
9911 worked & fit great on our Pentax. 
9912 More than happy. 
9913 Thanks for the fast shipping and they are so real looking. The only thing is they don t blink red except when I first put them up. I put new batteries in each one also. 
9914 great case also 
9915 I use the binoculars for birding nearly every week and daily during migration time. The binoculars have great optics are durable and comparable to others that are 10X more expensive. 
9916 excellent product. 
9917 Love this dash cam! The only thing I didn t like was the set up, but like any dash can setup it is a bit of a hassle. Besides that, it records crystal clear video with useful features that other brands doesn t have. 
9918 Great product! Very sturdy and does just what it says 
9919 [[VIDEOID:de691885db9775e4f408d9229f84434]]Great tripod product for light and heavy cameras. Working with the company is a delight. A problem arose and they immediately addressed it and sent a replacement. Not only is the product top shelf but the customer service is outstanding. 
9920 Works like a champ and it quite a bit cheaper on the wallet. 
9921 Need to be an expert to use it. Still working on it. Positive. Gives unexpected result. 
9922 Do NOT ever purchase non-Nikon batteries, I did. I will always buy real Nikon. 
9923 Sister in law loved these for her new camera 
9924 Worked well for the first couple uses and then the calibration got messed up. I suggest getting a small wagon for moving it around, as it is a bit too heavy for my back. 
9925 One of the lights will not turn on, I was also missing the camera stand from my delivery. The quality of the product is on point, besides these few hasseles I would buy the product again. 
9926 I purchased this T-ring adapter for use with my Nikon D7000. It is a perfect fit and works very smoothly. Great value too. 
9927 The camera overall produced excellent pictures and excellent video quality. I don t recommend people with really shaky hands to handle this camera though- Other than that- The price matches the value and I m happy overall with my purchase. 
9928 Great for powering field monitor. 
9929 Everything that I needed to run my camera with efficiency. 
9930 Recommended 100 % excellent product 
9931 Absolutely a great value. Takes really good pictures and has great slow motion video that we use for analyzing baseball swings. 
9932 These are fantastic. Does the job. Very clear not blurry. Very Very satisfied.....Well built. 
9933 nice gift 
9934 We actually replaced the first one because it wouldn t update and when we received the second one it wouldn t update either!! 
9935 Easy to use, arrived sooner than promised, looks great 
9936 didnt fit my canon EOS 5D. Sent back for a refund 
9937 Great quality product and even better service, will help support this business for future needs. 
9938 Worked as expected. 
9939 Received item quickly and love it! 
9940 Looked good but I didn t like how the gopro mounted to the pole- I would prefer it to screw in 
9941 Excellent product. I love it. 
9942 Exactly what I needed. I lost the original, these are great 
9943 Arrived quickly! So far it seems to work....just got it today we ll see in about a week or so if it really works 
9944 Just as described 
9945 For all the stuff this comes with this is definitely worth it. The case is a good size I have the L830 and I can fit more than just the camera :) 
9946 Great. 
9947 Great 
9948 excellent product. 
9949 My bolts from my GoPro were easily moved and loose so I got these and they actually give me a better quality video since its not easily getting bumped out of location 
9950 Charges the batteries quickly and fully, and the design means it takes up a minimum of space. Came on time. 
9951 Great & saved me soooooo much money!!!! I can buy almost 4 of these for the price of one of my Nikon flashes 
9952 Loved it 
9953 god 
9954 Worked as expected. No issues. 
9955 Works well. 
9956 I like this camera. 
9957 Always have trouble with it falling off when I m under water 
9958 Henry Was a great help installing my new Foscam camera. very knowledgeable about the system and fast. Totally satisfied. 
9959 Too bad it s not a constant aperture! 
9960 Wife set up without cable, and very fast connection to wifi network. live video is very smooth. will recommend to friend who wants to buy cameras. 
9961 Works great. Use this if you don t need the waterproof housing. Speakers aren t covered either. 
9962 Bought these with the Nikon Coolpix waterproof camera. Tried strap out in pool first and it works great. Definitely get these with the waterproof camera. 
9963 these have never failed me in the field, unlike some named brand models that cost a lot more 
9964 Its was great. Super awesome! 
9965 Great for my cine lens 
9966 The controls are pretty slow, and I can t get any videos to work, not even .mp4. It s supposed to play .mpeg4, which I think is the same? But since it wasn t super expensive, not bad. 
9967 Great pictures and great price. 
9968 Great product, exactly as we expected! 
9969 Well constructed, strong elastic, good fit- I m delighted with my new bino harness. I wouldn t hesitate to recommend this make. 
9970 Good value for a versatile mid-range zoom, complements the Nikkor 18-55mm found in many bundles. Autofocus can be a little slow, but it s fast enough for my general usage. 
9971 A bit of work to take apart the devices to program, but once done works very well. 
9972 we watched our home movies we hadn t seen in years. very impressed and very happy!!! 
9973 Do not buy. 
9974 Some of the things are a little hard to tighten down and will need to get an allen wrench to get it tight. The follow focus is also REALLY bad and doesn t work at all. Overall, it s really heavy but is pretty good. 
9975 Not good at all 
9976 The color of the camera was a bit darker then the picture but I love it! Still trying to figure out which settings work best in the lighting. Love having pictures instantly! 
9977 This is one of the worst tripods ever it cant even hold my cameras weight and it contains really cheap materials do not recommend anyone to buy this unless you are in really desperate needs 
9978 junk customer service not patient on the phone for almost a hour after getting it up and going soon I hang up it stop working sent it back could not get it to work I m not even giving it one star sucks 
9979 Superfast shipping, great! 
9980 Great item!!! 
9981 I can fit three of these stands in a normal-sized suitcases and still have room for clothes. They are very light and fairly durable. 
9982 Great for dental Lester Dine sells this camera for twice as much With a few accessories and &#34;support&#34; It s a rip off from them At $280 it s a bargain!!! I use it for dental photography 
9983 excellent product, excellent seller 
9984 Great gun mount... Now I can remember what I shoot. Simple but works really well, easy on and off ...but does not move during recoil. Fits on my shotgun and my Rifle. Has not moved, slide, or turned. Absolutely love it. Highly recommend. 
9985 These batteries are not worth the price. After shooting about 24 pictures they are dead. I bought these to have extra batteries on an Alaskan cruise. Little did I know I would have been better off not purchasing these. Don t waste your money. 
9986 good 
9987 Securely holds the camera and it won t slide off your head, but it hurts your forehead after awhile of wearing it. 
9988 I purchased the DMC-ZS40S Digital Camera from America Cameras through Amazon.com and was totally pleased with the quick delivery! The camera looks great and I m looking forward to using it. 
9989 Almost everything about this is pretty great; the neck stays put, the clamp is super strong and adjustable... but none of that matters since the brittle plastic clip snapped into 3 pieces on the second use. avoid! 
9990 Works very well and arrived quicker than expected 
9991 Ship faster that expected I would definitely recommended 
9992 not at all worth it. do not buy useless product. display quality is very poor 
9993 Light is great but they did not ship everything that comes with the light. Missing a vital piece. 
9994 Great quality case, perfect for boating, kayaking, and snowmobiling. I use it to keep my phone, wallet, and keys safe and dry. I have tested by swimming down 10ft with the case empty, not a drop inside. 
9995 This camera is great! I have not used it much but it has served me well for what I needed and still works. have had it in the water and all good! 
9996 Great pictures my daughter loves it 💯!!!!! 
9997 So fantastic! I bought this for a wedding, which was full sun and also indoors. It balanced the light wonderfully! Came in small package so it was easy to take in my camera backpack. Would definitely recommend 
9998 OEM Smart battery works great and fast shipping. 
9999 The included mounting accessories do not fit the GoPro Hero 4 housing. 
10000 Holds extras with my camera and it looks really nice 
10001 This kit is awesome! It s such a great deal and I love everything it came with!! The selfie mirrored lens is awesome!! The case is great quality! 
10002 The films were received some films packages were not working. 
10003 Just like the original 
10004 works 
10005 Not work 
10006 I have mixed feelings about this product. Although easy to assemble, the bars are so lightweight that on my first use, it bended, almost loosing its shape. I don t recommended for outdoor use. 
10007 Good but too small for a regular size hand and is also not high enough from the camera when mounted on. 
10008 Excelente 
10009 Very good product! No comments. 
10010 Great product, and customer service. Thanks to Henry! Very easy to use 
10011 this product does not work for the canon g12 camera 
10012 Nice 
10013 Very satisfied. 
10014 Product works but batteries are have an awkward fit and seem like they have poor quality. 
10015 exactly as expected. Wish the body was a little nicer as I would like to do some star shooting but a great first DSLR with lots of accessories. 
10016 it s nice off a 3 days ! after oleo phobic Coating start disappear - and all screen cover by smudges ! it s not first time - it s always happens :( 
10017 Works perfectly. As expected. This is a must have if you are in need of a quick release for a camera and a Promaster tripod. 
10018 Very disappointed with these filters. The threads do not seem to line up properly and they are difficult to get on and off. In fact, the uv filter actually fell off my camera as I was taking a picture over a cliff in Portugal! 
10019 This flash is the bOmb, Works insanely well without ever missing a beat from my receivers or off camera, slave or on camera works perfect everytime.. 
10020 The cameras were not uniform, some were hard to wind and didn t indicate 0 pictures left. I was not happy with the quality of pictures. 
10021 Cheap and works like a charm!!!! 
10022 It was delivered rapidly, and I m able to use it with ease. It is lightweight, and that s a plus for me. 
10023 Excellence product I would recommend it to all of my family and friends 
10024 Well equip will put to use 
10025 Use this on my Nikon D3200. Very happy with this flash. Good value. 
10026 A+ 
10027 Most of these have had good reviews. I returned mine, it would not power on. I would have replaced it, but I found a less expensive one. (I am paying for that now) 
10028 Excellent very responsible recommend 
10029 Looks fake and has to be eye leaves to work- we have it tilted up on a shelf but then it looks even faker. Very unhappy, especially for the price!! 
10030 it worked fine 
10031 I bought this set to take my GoPro to a rafting trip in Colorado River at Grand Canyon 
10032 I wasn t disappointed at all. I used the head strap and it worked beautifully. It was sturdy during all the crazy rapids. Highly recommended. 
10033 At the price range, it is a very good deal. 
10034 Workable for the price. Never be a rock but a decent stone. Any less than a hundred bucks! 
10035 No comment. 
10036 Works fantastic! 
10037 Used this on a photo tour works very well to keep your free 
10038 Fits great over the UV filter that comes with the Phantom, much easier to put on than the gimbal lock provided by DJI. Note: if you are using PolarPro filters, this cap will not fit. 
10039 Great service and timely delivery. Tape color matches photo. The tape is not as effective in sticking and holding down cabeles as other gaffers type tape I have used in the past, across differnt products and brands. It does not leave any sticky residue, just as they promised. 
10040 It will be great if it can also hold the phone in a vertical way 
10041 Great camera, the only problem is you can t see the recorded videos on it without an external device. The strap is garbage it doesn t stay on arm or hand. 
10042 love it 
10043 Wish I could get a refund. Used in 5 times And still couldn t get it to work right 
10044 Good and solid 
10045 Works perfectly and the price is right. An essential part of an inexpensive door key card access system. 
10046 Stuff didn t come on time and tripod doesn t work with camera 
10047 Used it a couple times. Sometimes it takes a few clicks to get it to work even if just connected a few moments earlier. Overall though its nice for group and night sky shots when I can t/shouldn t mangling hit the button. 
10048 Very nice lens as expected 
10049 I keep my Nikon D600 on it with an extra 80-200mm lens, battery charging in the camera space! If you have more than that you need the bigger size! I will be ordering a bigger one for the times I take everything, but this is a great day pack! 
10050 pricey but still ok 
10051 Great for travel, fits all of my current gear. Fits all of my lens, camera body and speedlights and other gear. 
10052 great shipping and product... works great 
10053 the round silicon cover for the naked gopro lens leaves a smudge on the lens that must be wiped off before use after storage. 
10054 batteries no good. cheap. won t charged. 
10055 Pushes out 8.4 volts... that s all I need. The OEM one is just the same? My concern is the plug end snapping or shorting, however, it is a standard issue plug...MQ172-3SA-CV(50) ... if it breaks. I hope the converter will hold up? 
10056 Not a bad setup for the price cameras are pretty good but seem to get a little blurry at a distance of 40 feet but overall system is good for the price 
10057 It works great, and I did not have to wait! It even came with a car charger. 
10058 OK 
10059 Good quality 
10060 Rear view mirror is dark. Can use a clearer mirror. Needs a better rewind feature to see previous recording. 
10061 Great off camera flash cord. It takes a little effort to install at the flash and camera ends so thst they are pushed all the way into position and locked 
10062 It s okay. Not very sturdy. 
10063 Took this camera on a recent trip to the UK and it was fantastic. I would highly recommend it. It is light, fast, and takes wonderful pictures. It also holds a charge for quite a while. 
10064 Loved it 
10065 I put one of these on my Polar on Saturday. I was already lifting and peeling at the corners a couple of days later. Good thing it came with 6 of them. 
10066 Very simple to install and operate, cameras are not very clear at night time. 
10067 Well built, everything I needed at a great price. 
10068 Great item for my GoPro. Give me infinite axes for moving my camera in any direction. Seems to be of good quality. I m pleased with it. 
10069 Very professional looking and sturdy. Easy to fold and place in carrier bag. 
10070 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5P26ImmSzI 
10071 Gopro did not work. Headband is of no use to me 
10072 It s to confusing to use and it even says it s a video recording device. A waste of 100 dollars. 
10073 It works as expected. Cheap and good value 
10074 Perfect for the office. I especially like the calendar, no more paper calendar pinned on my cubicle wall 
10075 freaking love it..... 
10076 Used this to replace an old VISTA15P that came with the house. Came with instructions and latest firmware. 
10077 I bought a package of items offered through Amazon. The package was to include a scope, mount and TWO flip back lens covers. I only recieved one lense cover not two. 
10078 System worked better than my original - nice refinements in the user interface - the new, Zsight app is great - cameras better clarity, resolution than those of my original, Zmodo system 
10079 is exactly what it said it was. Just the perfect size for attaching to my hiking pack shoulder strap. 
10080 like original. works perfectly. 
10081 Good Seller. Fast Delivery. I am very unsatisfied with the camera. Since first day the external color in one side (on the pool). I managed to keep it safe but ... 
10082 Better the OEM. Better price, love these batteries. 
10083 Very good set to get started with some studio photography. Items came as described and everything assembled and worked well. I like the carrying case for the bulbs and the umbrellas. It would be nice to have something similar for the stands. 
10084 Great product especially for the price! Super light-weight and easy to use. Good quality for the price. 
10085 Alright quality but very very cute 
10086 Everything was as advertised. Great camera, great experience. 
10087 Very nice lens with plenty of zoom. Auto focus work very well. 
10088 Just what I needed. Thanks 
10089 Tripod is very sturdy. All the benefits of a more expensive tripod without the big price tag. Thanks for making an affordable tripod for the small self-starters out here! 
10090 The batteries were very good, hold charge long time. The amperage is better than on the original JVC, but can t confirm this with tests. Overall, good product! 
10091 A great little camera, but the menus can be very difficult. Once mastered, and set the way you want it, the camera is excellent. 
10092 Looking at old slides to have printed to pictures. 
10093 I purchased the film for my babyshower 
10094 Buying the film was a great idea I placed the camera and let my guest take pictures 
10095 I have some many pictures and didn t even have to take them myself 
10096 Not right one. I ordered EN-EL19 
10097 I bought this as a companion gift to go with the camera. It is a really cute set, nicely packaged, and I am sure the 11 year old will love it. 
10098 Purchased for my son - he absolutely loves it. Shipping was super fast and item was exactly as described. Thank you! 
10099 thank you 
10100 Awesome Product! Will buy from them again in the future! 
10101 I love this flash. Super well made. 
10102 Great camera. Excellent picture quality. Battery life not great but not as bad with the right settings. 
10103 Henry was extremely helpful when I had difficulty connecting to my camera wirelessly. Works beautifully now! 
10104 Hard to put on 
10105 awesome 
10106 This is by far the best selfie/tripod stick ever. I have a friend who uses the go pro stick and he is jealous of my CamKix. I would definitely recommend this to any one with a go pro. 
10107 Everything seems OK quality, but received a non-functioning 52mm adapter. Seems to be a 55mm adapter that came with it... How did that happen? 
10108 Was a gift. 
10109 Very nice size and there is room for the extra battery...for my canon sureshot 
10110 They seem to run down fast, but there s 10 of them! 
10111 dead useful 
10112 We love our lens! It takes great actions shots during soccer games and great for scenery too! Thank you 
10113 A little bulky but does the job great, doesn t feel like it s going to come undone at all! 
10114 doesn t fit the lens. I l have to return it 
10115 Arrived fast. Seems better than OEM charger. Battery seems good, too, but it is early. 
10116 a must need if u are doing slingshot style 
10117 Worthless. The 1st-time ring is not loud enough, and then from the 2nd-time on, it just makes a quite clicking sound that is hardly hearable as if it had not power- but it was directly connected to a power source. Wasted my money. 
10118 works perfectly. for the price very good 
10119 Works great, but the picture may be misleading. It only comes with the 18&#34;, and not the set of 5 which is on the photo. 
10120 small and convenient! light weight and keep your GoPro secure in place. Highly recommended if you only have one GoPro and not a lot of accessories. 
10121 I will always buy Wasabi batteries. Very happy! 
10122 Does what it should, notify me if someone enters house while we are asleep. Would be nice if the arm/disarm was quieter, but can t expect that for the price. Covers a wide area and triggers over 30 away (max distance across room, could trigger further but could not test). 
10123 Being waterproof is the best thing ever. I’ve taken this on the river and dunked it intentionally and accidentally and it’s been marvelously dependable. Love the photo time lapse as well! 
10124 Nah... Even as a toy this is too expensive for what it is. For one thing it only works at the highest zoom level because at the lower levels you would start seeing black corners creeping into the picture. At either zoom level the distortion is too noticeable. 
10125 Thank you, it is perfect!! 
10126 Product was as advertised. 
10127 best product 
10128 Good size for my cameras, great design, very practical, well built. 
10129 excellent product. it was what I was expecting. 
10130 Very nice tripod for the $. 
10131 AC Adapter died after 1 year 
10132 This came in 2 days. Thought I would let people know how to unlock the locking mechanism as some people are unhappy with the product because they don t understand it. To unlock the plunger push down on the metal disc beneath the plunger. This works great. 
10133 Works great with my lenses as stated by others when fully expanded and shorter lenses zoomed out it will show up in your shot just collapse to second or 3rd depth and should be fine. 
10134 The foscam app will not connect to any of my devices. have lost 90% of the use for this camera 
10135 it works very good. 
10136 You get what you pay for! 
10137 Good Quality and very sturdy. Disregard any negative reviews, they did the job just fine for holing my green screen to the backdrop support system. 
10138 Sits by the back door of our cottage. Great for keeping an eye on the dogs, 
10139 Should be able to trigger video recording 
10140 Takes WONDERFUL photos, and the video is great as well. Get a few extra SD cards, make sure they are Class 10. Incredible ZOOM and super sharp images. I could not have asked for a better camera - video recorder. And you can take stills while it is recording video. 
10141 Worked well for me to recharge my camera battery while I was in Vietnam in june. 
10142 So very simple to setup and use...well done! We ll be using this under Windows, MAC and Linux but so far I tested it under Ubuntu 14.04 and it was refreshingly simple! 
10143 great product thank you 
10144 These screw adapters are as advertised. They re well made and fit flush in the machined photography bracket I m using. 
10145 Love this lens. Not as fast as some, but it s priced accordingly. Decent build quality and works great for video with the stem motor. 
10146 Using for external battery/charger for iPad/phone.. Just fits. 
10147 I Love all the X-cel series of eyepieces. I purchased all of them! 
10148 Awesome camera. I would give it 6 stars if I was able to zoom in, but nonetheless with 1080 p and 60fps, this is a good camera for all sports activities. 
10149 DO NOT BUY!!! Dropcam was great, Google cheapened and ruined it. Dropped resolution to 720, and the network drops off 8 or 10 times per day, even cust.. Support will tell you that nest(Google) ruined their company. Be fore warned, find a different camera! 
10150 Powerful but very inconsistent performance, ttl will at some times tend to over/under expose, not very reliable but good third-party flash for the money 
10151 Tamron 150-600 fits well with lens hood in storage position. 
10152 I like this camera but use something else for night photos. 
10153 Same as Canon preformance 
10154 Works great. 
10155 Setup way to complicated for the average user. 
10156 Excellent !! 
10157 work Fine excellent!!!!! 
10158 This did not fit the battery to the camera I own even though the listing says it will. 
10159 Great deal ... fast shipping ... exactly what I needed. 
10160 Very good!!! 
10161 Original equipment that fits like it should! 
10162 Great Product. High Picture Quality. Though Screen Resolution is not that good but Photos are of very good Quality. Fast Shipping. 
10163 Nice compact diffuser, easy to install and in testing does a nice job of evenly illuminating a scene. 
10164 Thrs no intraction how to use it 
10165 Great! 
10166 Works as advertised. Just make sure you re buying the right one. Nikon makes two nearly identical lenses with different hood mounts. This hood goes straight on, it doesn t twist on. 
10167 Picture quality is poor, no way to save or review video.. only a live feed. 
10168 One of the BEST deals I ve ever gotten on these batteries! 
10169 Great little camera for the money. It don t record but will take pictures. These pictures aren t great quality but again for what your paying a good value. 
10170 it dosent support P2P 
10171 Birthday gift for my daughter, she seems happy with it. 
10172 Works perfectly to charge our Nikon D-600 camera battery. 
10173 perfect price for getting the job done! thank you! 
10174 Great product 
10175 Doing what it s supposed to do! 
10176 Allows for lots of applications. I use it for my band s gigs. 
10177 It didn t work 
10178 Used many times and am very happy with the compact size and versatility of this tripod. Well worth the cost. 
10179 Good product; timely shipping. 
10180 If you are looking for an inexpensive, but trustworthy tripod! I could not recommend this one enough! I thought that if I bought something cheap my camera would tip the whole thing over but that is not the case! Definitely get s the job done! 
10181 A gift-what was requested. 
10182 I am new to whole quad copter and was looking for a cheap quad to learn. This thing is perfect for that and very sturdy. I can t even count how many times I crashed it and it still kept on working. Great bundle and great value. 
10183 AmazonBasics 
10184 Nice scope, though the tripod doesn t hold the weight of the scope and is useless. Otherwise it s a nice setup. 
10185 Works well 
10186 The charger works very good with my two different nikon cameras. The packaging was perfect because it wasn t too big, just the right size and it came earlier than i expected so good job Amazon. 
10187 Using it on Nexus 7 II. Works great! Good quality. 
10188 It s a bit deceptive in size, I m 6 1&#34; and I have to bend over to adjust the Camera. Works ok, but I would need a taller Tri-pod. 
10189 Works as intended. Use on my recent snorkle trip and also to simply to hold up my go pro. 
10190 This enclosure has a nice finish and strong construction. 
10191 Great Product 
10192 Does exactly what it says. Simple little product that keeps me organized 
10193 just ok 
10194 video footage is always grainy and low light no matter what is done to adjust. Big Big waste of money. This is just an overpriced vivitar!!! 
10195 Actually my daughter loves them! Got them for her for her birthday. She leads hiking tours and whale watching tours in Juneau, Alaska. She really likes them and they help her spot birds for the tourists. 
10196 Arrived quickly and just worked great immediately. This is a terrific tool for the price. Wish the Sony had an infrared receiver on its backside, but this is really easy to use. 
10197 Great product 
10198 Love all the different clips and straps 
10199 Small enough for your pocket 
10200 I m using it with the I-phone adapter to record fly fishing casts and it works extremely well. Completely stable and tall for the recording and light and compact for moving and storage. Great value. 
10201 Worth every penny! Buy it! Love that the camera compartment can be removed. Leather is awesome and it works great! 
10202 Really loud! when your battery is low. I left it on my battery overnight and it only used .01 of a volt in 24 hours 
10203 Perfect lens for portrait photos 
10204 I purchased for my daughter, she is very happy with the purchase 
10205 Of course the day after I ordered this I found the original one, but I did keep this one. I tried it out and it did work and saving it as back up for when I lose the one that came with my fuji camera. 
10206 Thank goodness someone is still making these !!!! Thanks ! 
10207 Exactly the item I ordered and it came new and box as promised 
10208 My blender came without velcrow to attach -_- it s useless. 
10209 Camera was very grainy with my security system. Could have been my system but the 800 tvl from this company is clearer. 
10210 Nice product. Makes viewing photos easy, can brign them up on my smart phone and send right away. Can also use the smartphone to take the pictures. 
10211 work very good days and night can see very clear i recommend it 
10212 worst flash i ever used , doesn t work with d7100 in wireless flash trigger mode and the quality of the light in hot shoe is too bad 
10213 Works well. 
10214 Pretty cool lens, great value for the price. Couldn t believe it actually had metal mount! 
10215 A sharp, compact prime lens that does depth of field shots that the 12-40mm zoom lens cannot readily do. 
10216 Haven t used it in the field yet but first impression is this is should be included in the box. 
10217 High quality precision, travel ease, exceptional overall design 
10218 Great I love this I ve had fun with it ever since i got it it also came fast 
10219 It works fine. Very pleased. 
10220 The mounts we re exactly as advertised and connected to my camera with ease. Good quality and nice clean look. One Mount clip missing when the package arrived, I contacted PolarPro and had a new one shipped to me the next business day. 
10221 Guess what - it charges two batteries at a time, works fairly quickly, seems to stop when charged (when I forget them in the charger they never get warm). That s what I was looking to buy....would buy this product again. 
10222 Works well 
10223 the design is cute, I just wish taking it out and putting it back in was easier since i have to take it out to check the amount of film i have left and to replace the film and batteries. 
10224 Did not blink after installing new batteries. Tried another set of batteries, same problem. I looked at the camera during the day and night several times 
10225 I have found this back pak easy to load/configure and is quite versatile. It is easy to carry and offers good protection for the contents. 
10226 Perfect fit. The lens I had bought should have come with one of these, but for the price it fills the bill. 
10227 Good 
10228 Didn t work consistently. Had to return. Thank you Amazon for a wonderful return policy! 
10229 I love this perfect size tote for my DSLR and nifty fifty. This way I ll never miss a moment. Very roomy for keys, cards, and phone. It s also stylish which is the less important use, but it s definitely a perk plus. 
10230 Works just as good as original battery. 
10231 Very handy backpack, nice size. All my camera gear fits, along with chargers, notebooks and iPad. 
10232 they worked great. 
10233 Works very fine so far. Attaching strings should come in very handy for people like me. :) 
10234 this is a great drone for beginners! worth the price for what it is! controlled by an app for your phone! buy extra batteries and props with this product 
10235 Could not have ask for more , great deal everything as discribed. My only problem was self created. Ended up buying a camo cam could have used a better shoulder strap 
10236 But this product was everything that I expected and more. Great seller, quick shipping. 
10237 The selfie stick is cheap not worth it in my opinion. The other gadgets worked fine 
10238 Works great and I got them at a discount compared to local stores. 
10239 This product is amazing and at very low cost. Most importantly, the live customer support was extremely helpful in solving a problem I had in getting all my cameras recognized. Very special thanks to Alan ( badge id# AR004639) at D-Link Customer support (877) 595-6935 
10240 This is the perfect tripod for carrying inside my small camera bad. It opens and collapsed easily but locks into position when the legs are extended and given a small twist. 
10241 Best sensor cleaning swabs available. 
10242 Is it a nikon battery? NO. Could I tell the difference? Not really.. I am skeptical of off brand batteries but this one is just like OE, for 1/3 price. Used in D800, and performance was comparable/identical to nikon batt. 
10243 Good Deal! 
10244 Had me excited to shoot again 
10245 Great camera, use it to keep an eye on my dogs while I m away at work. 
10246 Wonderfully exposes image with good dynamic range. Even though a lower resolution than my other cameras, the picture looks far better due to better exposure, dynamic range, and colors. Lens is distinctly wide angle compared to my other cameras, too. 
10247 As others say, rubber on product smells like toxic waste, after washing ten times, spraying it with armour all, I can stand it. Nice product if it were less toxic. 
10248 So happy to have an extra battery since our other one kept dying on vacation. We ll get a lot of use from this. 
10249 Kit arrived on time and was exactly as described. Very happy with experience. 
10250 This lens is fun to use although I still keep my other lens handy. I am satisfied with the quality and value for the price. 
10251 Lot Heavier then expected. 
10252 So far great! 
10253 A very simple review: this is now the only GoPro mount / accessory I take with me when I m hiking, biking or on the water. Versatile, simple, reliable. Excellent. And handy as a tripod too. 
10254 Very good! Thanks 
10255 This quadcopter is the most fun I ve had for under $50 in years! 
10256 Stay away took 12 hours still won t able to fixed 
10257 doesn t fit if you have the lens hood in place unlike original 
10258 too small to use 
10259 Works with my d7000, v1, and d70 (and i assume the rest of the nikon lineup), and is cheaper than the nikon version. 
10260 Great product. I am very satisfied of the quality of the pictures. Soo happy to have the camera definitely purchasing again. 
10261 Very good camera strap with the ability to quickly disconnect the strap from the camera. Just what i needed. Good quality at a very good price. 
10262 Works great, small profile. But... You must have camera shutter set to timer/remote mode first. Instructions fail to mention that. 
10263 Soooo cheapy, we went to extend it and one of the poles came all the way off, one wouldn t open (stuck inside tube, tried to remove it with tweezers but it bent--- with tweezers!) very low quality, don t waste your money! 
10264 Not a bad deal. 
10265 I really like the case perfect size perfect color 
10266 Not suitable for a 6 individual. Sling strap when adjusted to max length is too short. Camera rides high (under your arm) and cannot be raised for shooting because of the short straps. 
10267 easy to configure! 
10268 its ok 
10269 Nice backdrop! 
10270 Super helpful! Used it for my camera and sure enough, works great! :) 
10271 Awesome camera. I am a dslr user and needed something to replace my huge amount of gear. Resolution is what I expected but of course not as high as my Nikon d800 s But definitely a fun and powerful camera in terms of performance. 
10272 Sometime it will not work 
10273 Great product. I will continue to buy Olukai for all of my sandal needs. 
10274 I waited to write a review until I used this product for meany months, its fantastic and illuminates my light box fantasticlt!!! Absolutely fantastic packaging and everything came fast and works great!! 
10275 Holding up well. 
10276 It is an awesome product! Sets up easy and has a great carrying case. I love it!! 
10277 A must have for your telescope. 
10278 vibrates way too much to use for camera 
10279 Camera still doesn t work. Don t know if it s the cable or camera 
10280 Very versatile. Easy to use. Finally can take family photos without accosting a stranger... 
10281 Buy a go pro instead 
10282 Cool 
10283 This works very well. 
10284 A++++++++++++ Thank you !! 
10285 They are perfect for a cell phone, tablet or eye glasses. They get all the fingerprints and oil off without a problem. 
10286 Easy to use; good pictures 
10287 I use this unit with my Nikon D60 DSLR and it works perfect. No problems and less expensive than the Nikon counterpart. 
10288 excellent service the Bobber works really well in the water great product 
10289 This is a wonderful case, I loved it so much that I bought another case that was just a bit smaller. They are both very strong and practical. This is a great tool and I m happy that I purchased these. 
10290 Easy to use 
10291 Works as expected, and much cheaper than the GoPro brand one. I only wish it somehow floated right side up... 
10292 This works well, turns off when done, and the price is right 
10293 These things are a blast and cheap enough so it really doesn t matter if you destroy it.. Yeah they are very durable Also found that if you want to fly it outside, push in on the left stick, makes it more aggressive. 
10294 Works well with small camera at the beach. Seems to be well made. 
10295 product as advertised. 
10296 There s nothing really special about it but it will get the job done. I wish there were cuter, more stylish options for DSLR sleeves but it is what it is. 
10297 It works as expected. 
10298 Very helpful 
10299 Other than one brief Bluetooth dropped connection, this selfie stick performed flawlessly on our recent trip, in both cool and hot, humid conditions. Definitely a solid, affordable purchase! 
10300 It works and I like it. Cheap in cost, but feels sturdy. 
10301 Had some problems with it. I usually use my Nikon D-5100 but thought I wanted a smaller camera that I could carry easier. Guess I expected the photo quality to be the same as the digital SLR but was disappointed. However, Amazon let me return it without any hassle. 
10302 Awesome high quality product. It said USED with cosmetic damage but its not noticeable 
10303 I used it for all of my Music Videos. Youtube Search: Jeremy Crescendo 
10304 Excellent Product. 
10305 Not for original go pro 
10306 I love this flash. So excited to finally own one. 
10307 I have yet to have an issue with it after a few months of owning. Taken hundreds of photos with it thus far. No complaints. 
10308 Nothing better than these. Recommended. 
10309 Works great. Always good to have plenty standby power and charging 2 at a time makes it much quicker. 
10310 really hard to get a signal. A waste of money 
10311 Works well - very satisfied with Amazon transaction/service. 
10312 I was very pleased with this product. Was a little worried that wouldn t actually be compatible with my camera but everything worked really well. Thanks. 
10313 Used these to clean the inside of my windshield to get rid of that weird haze that builds up. Worked perfectly. Hard to handle in that situation, so I wrapped them around another towel so I could grip them better. 
10314 The selfie pole is flimsy but overall there are plenty of attachments for great angles. 
10315 The best way to take your GoPro out on the water. 
10316 Allows me to charge three battries at once when I use the power adapter. If I try to just use USB - will only charge two. 
10317 Works great! Speedy shipping 
10318 All good stuff,, but the packing really bad!! Card boar was tear,,, n weak!!! 
10319 Came quick and works great. 
10320 Really like the camera, the lense size is double what we expected. Picture and video quality is amazing. Very confused by the fact it s made for European outlets though. 
10321 This camera has served me well for a long time. I would recommend it to anyone wanting a good quality, no nonsense camera. 
10322 Very good quality, I m pleased. 
10323 So, ordered the standard housing 2.0, but unfortunately received the dive housing 2.0. Did not even realize this until I was already on the dive boat today. Will update product review once proper product is received. 
10324 Excellent quality! Very happy with the purchase! 
10325 Great product. As advertised and of super quality.... 
10326 exactly what i expected! i love this set and i definitely recommend it. 
10327 Best Charging System for all GoPro batteries including other manufacturers. 
10328 Great Value! 
10329 These dont even hold a charge as lonh as my original 2yr old battery 
10330 It s a cheap lense hood that fits well and gets the job done, not much else to say. 
10331 Perfect Fit! 
10332 Started looking for a camera I liked with a good zoom lens 5 years ago. This camera is exactly what I was looking for. Glad I waited. Love this camera! 
10333 Great accessory bought two :) one for me and the other for my daughter in law :) 
10334 Excellent product. I solved a problem with a camera at nights. 
10335 Great item works great!!! 
10336 I love my new iPad. It is easy to use. 
10337 Will return to seller. 
10338 Works great. Charges 2 batteries at the same time. Like all great devices it uses a micro USB. Very pleased with this product 
10339 Great for the price! 
10340 LOVE LOVE LOVE!! Camera is Excellent and my husband loves it all!! 
10341 Fast delivery, Items exactly as described. Good place to purchase your add-on s for camera security. 
10342 i have other cheaper ones that works as good 
10343 Ain t nobody got time for expensive go pros. Go cheap and buy more. Works great can t complain and for the price it s insane. 
10344 The underwater pictures are better than those that are not. Resolution is low - but bought it for them to rough around with. Will buy nicer one when they are a bit more gentle with these things. 
10345 Fits my camera perfectly 
10346 will USE THIS RECOOMEND THIS 
10347 The remote doesn t work with my Canon Rebel t3i EOS 600D 
10348 Very nice portrait lens good price and fast shipping 
10349 Works great 
10350 best bag for short travel 
10351 Purchased this as a gift and the person loves it! 
10352 Worked great. Fits my hero just fine and is water tight. 
10353 Everyone has a plan till they get punched in the mouth. - Mike Tyson 
10354 great started drone, good price, high quality. 
10355 Works very well makes it handy to do angled shots. 
10356 Works great, good price. 
10357 thank you 
10358 Camera works amazingly; takes great photos, although the quality of them varies a bit in low light. 
10359 Charger works great and is simple to use. 
10360 What a great camera! Because of how I have my home wi-fi set I had to use their customer service. Wow is the only way to put it. They were very responsive and offered the highest level of service I have seen in a long time. 
10361 I haven t used the flash as yet, but I have demonstrated it in practice It works as well or better than the ones costing 5 times as much 
10362 Higher capacity than original battery, and support all functions. Charged it fully, so lets see how long it can last and hold a charge. 
10363 I was worried about ordering any electronics from online, but I had nothing to worry about. It was excellent condition!! Works beautifully and gets the job done!! LOW priced and fast shipping!! Feel safe when ordering from this seller!! Thank you!! 
10364 THE YN600EX- RT FOR MY CANON 70D PERFORMED GRATE, I DID A 60th BIRTHDAY PARTY THIS PAST WEEKEND WITCH RAN 7 HOURS AND THE FLASH WORKED GREAT I USED MOST OF IT S FUNCTIONS. IT PERFORMED JUST LIKE THE CANON VERSION ONLY CHEAPER. 
10365 Best film ever made; now it s about the only film made. 
10366 Does what i need to do perfectly! I bought this camera just to start making youtube piano videos. For an &#34;entry level&#34; GoPro this is remarkable! Check out the video I made with it! https://youtu.be/c2IH5HMuC5Y 
10367 best way to shoot macros! 
10368 Did the job 
10369 These guys are the best! Shipped case super fast, and it is a great product! 
10370 Received as described and prompt shipping. Great price and high quality. 
10371 Looks good. That s where the goodness ends. Boom arm to pole connector does not really hold: loaded, the whole construct slips. Consider looking elsewhere. PS.: while not excluding a &#34;crooked hands&#34; factor, this particular design does not work for me. 
10372 Exactly what was advertised. 
10373 I just received it,hopefully it will be fine 
10374 The lens is pretty darn good. Almost the only one you d ever need considering the iso range available on the unit. Still figuring out the rest of the settings 
10375 My friend told me that her husband loved these pajamas! This is what she said he wanted for Christmas. She loves that they are so soft. They were given as a Christmas gift. 
10376 Ok for price 
10377 Straight from the mother land (China) 
10378 Requires a VERY high internet speed. My DSL was maxed out and it still did not function. 
10379 Best purchase I have ever made. 
10380 Just what I needed to get my laptop to talk to my Nikon. What is that funny little Nikon connector called anyway? 
10381 It is so much more substantial than the one that came with my camera...Fits better and is made sturdier. 
10382 I only received two lens not three. 
10383 very nice, I bought it to have in different places in my house car and my husband took few to his office i just wish they were a bit bigger. 
10384 I love it. 
10385 Awesome 
10386 lots of problems, wouldnt buy it again. 
10387 You have to charge this thing everyday...complete waste of money. First item arrived damaged, return was easy but still not worth the money. Going to be putting into the trash. Only recordings I have gotten are when I first place it onto the wall. 
10388 Bought this for my 12 year old niece as her first digital camera. This camera takes crappy pictures 😕. Not worth the purchase. 
10389 A very nice product. 
10390 Love it! 
10391 Quick & easy setup. Just be sure to plug it in to your computer FIRST, then plug it into the wall outlet. This is my second camera. I am going to order a third. One for home & two for business. 
10392 I love it so much I never expected to run out of film so quickly ahaha 
10393 love this backpack holds a good bunch of gear fits well to wear and the laptop area is great 
10394 Gave this as a gift for a fellow photographer. She loved it! I wonder if this name brand is as good as the other manufacturers... 
10395 Great product! 
10396 ok 
10397 fits nicely into the pack. 
10398 Motor and gears break easily. Must order parts online. However, they are easy to replace. My son loves the copter. 
10399 I m very happy with this product! 
10400 Exactly as advertised 
10401 Looks like the real deal. Love it. 
10402 Sorry- had to return it. Much too small for a 50mm full frame lense. 
10403 I gave it to a friend 
10404 Awesome Handle! About the cheapest you can buy from anywhere and it s built VERY well. 
10405 Really happy with this purchase, amazing camera for a reasonable price. I don t use everything from the bundle but it was a great deal. 
10406 Not well ventilated. 
10407 very good 
10408 Good item 
10409 Excelente producto!!! 
10410 Seems to work perfectly with the Lee Holder and my 105 mm polarizer. Good quality, and while it costs much less than the Lee, it is still overpriced. Lee products, but especially their accessories, are CRAZY expensive. 
10411 Get it out of the box and you are ready to use it. Just synchronize, via Bluetooth your phone, and you have your shutter working. 
10412 Nice camera easy to use and get started quickly 
10413 Does NOT do anything 
10414 very useful for outdoor carrying 
10415 Outstanding product which does exactly what it says it does. I purchased these cleaning cloths strictly for cleaning my eyeglasses because I don t care for the smaller cleaning clothes. So, my 2 concerns were (1) cleans glasses well and (2) adequate size. These cleaning clothes met those 2 concerns. 
10416 I love it. Very comfortable, durable, and for the price is amazing I managed to attach it along with my neck band and use both actively. 
10417 A little flimpsy but works pretty well 
10418 Very easy to use and takes terrific pictures 
10419 Great buy and great company 
10420 Husband loves it. He said he wont use everything but atleast he has it when he needs it. 
10421 Perfect 
10422 Quite sturdy. 
10423 This is a great value if you need to record a long segment. It s crazy that it even comes with a cigarette adapter, which I doubt I ll use. 
10424 Suks 
10425 I will do the job.. not the best tripod but for the money it s good enough for my purpose’s. 
10426 Loving this camera!!! There was a mix up with the flash, but Photo-4-Less was quick to respond to our request for a replacement. Waiting for it to arrive. 
10427 This was a great deal. I only needed the charger (I lost mine) so getting the two batteries with it was a bonus. The charger works great. The shipping was really fast too. I had it within just a couple days. 
10428 Broken product was not what I expected to be 
10429 poor image quality 
10430 Nice product at a reasonable price. 
10431 Bought for my son s Go Pro because his somehow broke. He loves the color and is looking to replace whatever he can on his GoPro case with parts of the same color. Recommend. 
10432 Love this sports cam it s so clear and love how it works on wifi, to me why spending 400 on a go pro when this one can do the same to me even better, thank you for giving me the opportunity to get this product in exchange my review 
10433 Works great with Nikon D3300. 
10434 Great screen protector for camera LCD s. This product is easy to size and apply to the LCD screen. It holds fast but can be removed without leaving a residue when it s time to replace or change it. 
10435 It works. What more can you say. 
10436 Awesome 
10437 this is the perfect case for my camcorder its sleek, comfortable and I was able to fit all the accessories into it and still have room left over for id or credit cards. I love this case 
10438 The camera looks just like the picture, but I am a bit disappointed in the way it does not focus well when zoomed in from a distance. Also find the transfer of pics to phone a little cumbersome and slow usually. 
10439 With every shot from a 12 gauge the camera would move completely out of the way or at one point even managed to fly off. But good for fishing and other random projects. 
10440 It needs more compartments to put the accessories in. 
10441 Best beginner quad out there!!! 
10442 nothing to write. It comes with hardly no instructions or service manual. camera have a narrow scan width & it will not take a sata hard drive smaller than 500 GB. Sorry but I would not purchase another one. 
10443 The charger does what it is supposed to do. We are happy with that and that the price was right. 
10444 did not work. I have to return item. 
10445 I m a photographer and I love these. Great 
10446 Great Camera, bought for my 12 year budding photo journalist. She can t wait for school to start so she can help with the school yearbook. 
10447 It s excellent product I really like it 
10448 The housing can go with thwe other compllement for the tripod 
10449 As described. 
10450 Works as described 
10451 great. 
10452 This is a superb lens, and a very useful macro. 
10453 I was pleasantly surprised when I saw how big these are. There are six individually packaged cloths, so you can share them if you want, I intend to buy more for stocking stuffers. They work great and are easy to keep clean. 
10454 fast and sharp. Great quality. 
10455 Absolutely love this camera! The color quality, sharpness and quickness in capturing the images surpassed what I expected. It s worth every penny. The instant gratification of having the photo and sharing with friends and family is totally special. 
10456 Nice little lens. This does everything i need it to do. 
10457 Excellent gear, very well crafted! The grip for the camera is a little flimsy though - Go with this grip in this package instead. Great combo. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00S4NB2IY/ 
10458 Just what I needed. 
10459 Love my new camera!! 
10460 as described. Thanks! 
10461 Danny was excellent at fixing my camera. I do love my camera. 
10462 works great and great price 
10463 Does exactly what it is designed to do...Works great for me 
10464 Panasonic FZ series is so much better. I had high hopes for Fujifilm but they do not compare to the clear and sharp images of Panasonic - even if you go back a few model years. 
10465 Nice case and extremely sturdy. Doesn t quite accommodate the remote for the phantom 3, but 5 minutes with a knife on the foam solves that. It s a big case but between the remote, phantom, power supply and two batteries it gets a little tight. 
10466 Great! 
10467 Fits my Nikon with 18-200 zoom perfectly. Plenty of extra pockets to carry other essentials. Love it! 
10468 Holds like iron. Pleased. 
10469 I purchased many sets of camera straps from OP/TECH USA, and finally this one met my expectations in terms of strap length because I prefer to carry my camera over my shoulder and I don t like to hang my camera from its bottom but from its eyelets. 
10470 Keeps items inside safe and dry. Case is durable and feels solid. Usuale pelican quality. 
10471 Works as promised 
10472 I just got this product and it s not charging 
10473 I m so disappointed hope will refund my money soon 
10474 I used this for a time lapse sequence on my old D70s. Worked just fine. The customer loved the sequence used in a commercial spot. 
10475 Shotty. Didn t work 
10476 great product. I d rather it had a len protector included. 
10477 a must have 
10478 EXCELLENT!!! 
10479 Nice lighting. 
10480 Using a variety of leica camera R8,M6ttl, digilux, T series and monochrome this unit good with all. Along with leica tripod proves very useful. 
10481 Batteries work well and charge fast, no complaints. 
10482 Works well, does a good job protecting the glass. 
10483 Like it for a small bag. 
10484 works great for my motovlogs no problems at all 
10485 Don t buy the cheap mounts. Buy the GoPro original. It s worth the additional cost. I rode over 2300 miles on my Harley with this attached to the front fairing and it worked great. 
10486 bought this for my wife. She absolutely LOVES it!!! 
10487 Fits well, although it isn t reversible on my tamron lens, I suspect it may be on other brands. 
10488 my brother will like it thank you 
10489 Great kit with accessible price. Definitely would recommend it! 
10490 Great; strong, reliable, compact easy to set up/break down...what more could you ask for. 
10491 I m giving this 5 stars because my boyfriend likes this. I bought it for him and he seems to be pleased with the way it is working. 
10492 I love it however it is a little bit tricky to get off. 
10493 Great！ 
10494 I own 2 of these and they get a lot of usage in my business. Very good quality. I swapped out the traditional 3 position heads on my Manfrotto tripods and now use these exclusively. 
10495 As advertised. 
10496 Fast shipping and fits perfect on our Sony camera 
10497 love this background, it photos really well. I use it alot 
10498 Fits the lens perfectly and adds some scratch protection for the front of the lens. 
10499 Was in the market for something affordable and useful; this product provides both! As a new photographer I am very pleased, and recommend to anyone who is starting out! 
10500 Charger worked perfectly with my camera battery. Have not used the car charger yet, but so happy to have one while traveling. 
10501 Works great 
10502 The case itself is quite small. I had expected a bit larger. But it does hold my enough gear for my ski or boat bag. Pros: good construction, enough space for some gear Come: quite small If you need a small gopro session case this is for you! 
10503 Way too many features to remember how to use them. As a point-and-shoot camera it isn t ideal. 
10504 Absolutely outstanding 
10505 Worked as describe would get it again if I needed it. 
10506 Charger has bad ports, will kill batteries charged there. Was good for a little while (4-6 months?) but then it killed batteries. It took me a while to realize it was the charger, not the batteries failing. 
10507 Easy connection (Android), images are clean and color true for a little portable printer. Zink paper cost is reasonable. 
10508 I can no longer live without my Benro. I love it. 
10509 So enjoying this selfie stick for my videos and for photos! 
10510 This works well for my Ebay pictures. 
10511 This will only fit an iPhone without a case. Too small to hold iPhone with case. 
10512 came fast, good price, thanks! 
10513 Good product and a fantastic seller A++++++ 
10514 Innovative! Does what it says. Convenient, compact. Also useful to diffuse light for macro shots. 
10515 It was just what I expected and needed 
10516 Quick turn around. What I expected! 
10517 Thx 
10518 This backpack has tons of room for all my camera and accessories. It s well constructed as well as padded. A bit I n the big side but still comfortable to carry. 
10519 Bought this for my grandson that turned 13 and it is prefect for him. A great beginner camera and easy to use. 
10520 I ve had this charger for many months now and continue to be satisfied with the operation. 
10521 I used it less than five times decided just stop trying. It was so hard to figure out what I was hearing. I wish I used it sooner so I could get my money back. Don t waste your time and money on this device! 
10522 After looking everywhere for these batteries, my dad lost hope that he would find batteries for his Canon DSLR camera. When I heard him lamenting about this, I suggested that I look on Amazon. Voila! Problem solved! Thanks for making my 90 year old dad a happy camper. 
10523 Everything it s supposed to be 
10524 Works great with my Panasonic HC-W850K Digital HD Camcorder 
10525 A very handy lightweight pack for a single lens and camera and accessories. 
10526 Not happy at all! Drops control link sometimes less than 10 meters. I find it not reliable at all. 
10527 This works perfect for my Canon SX530. An excellent product. I recommend it highly! 
10528 as described. Works well on my camera. 
10529 I love my camera! I keep it in my purse! I never use my big Canon anymore! 
10530 To be completely honest, the item was flown one time and already needs replacement parts 
10531 Not very happy with the robustness Of the product. Easily broken. Will be contacting the company for answers and replacement parts. It does fly ok. Very touchy controls. 
10532 Small size recharger.. Working excellent.. Battery also good.. 
10533 Good product. Arrived promptly as promised. 
10534 I love my new camera. It s a beginner photographer setup. Memories in the making. 
10535 I bought this as a combo for the infinity portable speaker and it didnt fit the damn thing 
10536 Nice quality especially for the price. Would definitely buy other colors. 
10537 The fact this doesn t turn off is my only score against it. It s also a bit confusing to use, but not difficult to learn. Works great. Would prefer a wireless version. works with my D7100 
10538 Perfect 
10539 great! 
10540 I have used LensPens since my first DSLR a Pentax *ist DL back in 2006. They work great on my lenses and haven t caused any scratches or issues. A quick and painless way to clean my lenses. 
10541 Excellent product. 
10542 No problems here! This is the backup battery for my Nikon D7200. It charged up quickly as I expected and lasted as long as the battery that came with the camera. 
10543 Lost my original Nikon charger. This one works as advertised and comes with a vehicle charger attachment. 
10544 This mic was the reason I kept getting error messages on my 70D. Didn t have time or patients to trouble shoot it. Sent it back. 
10545 Great Price, works great 
10546 Holds everything except the kitchen sink. Works great! 
10547 Great! 
10548 It cant be support a big camera. 
10549 Love it 
10550 This is one of the best lenses Canon makes. If I m shooting outdoor portraits, this is what I reach for. 
10551 so far it has worked as expected. 
10552 Cheap and works perfect for semi-pro activities. 
10553 Thank you for the material of the order, everything went well with the delivery man 
10554 Nice camera!! I m very happy with my camera and the teleobjective of 300mm but the rest of the material is not worth it, the quality is bad. 
10555 AMAZING! In love with it.. soft, comfy, stylish. :) 
10556 works great!! 
10557 classy way to offer a days shoot to friends,clients, family members 
10558 Just what I need for my 1st Aid kit 
10559 I have been in love with this camera since I got it. I m still learning the advanced functions. 
10560 Item is broken. I guess I ll be using super glue since it s not worth the hassle of returning. 
10561 Great lights, would highly recommend 
10562 Easily connects and works so well! Very easy to carry around. 
10563 Cheap, broken, this sums up what this tripod is all about. Doesn t matter where you get it you will find the same. Shame on you Targus. 
10564 Had an odor but is a great deal and great way to keep camera safe. 
10565 On time delivery, packaged very well. Excellent product that functions as advertised. Easy to place or remove, easy to use. 
10566 Camera stopped working within 30 days. It was a worst experience i had, i went for a trip with my family and thought to capture all the moments with this new camera but it stopped working all a sudden and i couldn t capture any pics of this trip. 
10567 It works pretty well, but the reels seem like they re a little to narrow for 35mm. The film was getting jammed a lot, and rounding the lead edges of the film with scissors seemed to help, but I ve hard to re-start rolls several times. 
10568 So far so good. 
10569 .then again all batteries are good brand new.. 
10570 Good 
10571 JUNK 
10572 What I really like about this product is that there were two straps included with the mount that could be used. Hooray!! 
10573 sound wasn t great item looked and felt very cheap and batteries cost. 
10574 It did not accept the app, the disk would not load up.many trials and nothing. 
10575 Thanks 
10576 Quick and painless setup including wireless. Resolution is good. 2-way comm works. 
10577 bad camera sent 2 back to aweek will not try that brand again 
10578 I use it all the time, great lens. 
10579 Extremely thin and high quality. I would purchase again if I need another filter for my other lenses. 
10580 gave as birthday present. what a wonderful camera! 
10581 Perfect for all we use it for. Great for under water shark viewing. 
10582 Great price. Very easy to use. Also very sturdy. 
10583 Love everything about it 
10584 great tone, still tryung to find the right spot for it 
10585 Cameras arrived w/out any damage since it was packaged properly. Had problems setting 3 cameras wireless. DLink support was fantastic. Wait time was less than 5 mins. DLink support ( C6720565-AR004231, AR004207,AR004208) walked me thru the wireless setup. 
10586 Great price, excellent protection! 
10587 Solid construction and fits well in my arca ballhead. 
10588 Tripod itself is great, but the adapter isn t. I had to buy a replacement adaptor in a few weeks. 
10589 Hang on to it. It s small and you like having it on the camera. Check to be sure it s not loose. 
10590 I found this macro rail to be very well built, especially for the price point. movement is smooth and precise. I m quite happy with the purchase. 
10591 Good 
10592 Great little camera to mount on the bottom of a RC airplane! Tons of fun! Wonderfully clear pictures..This replaces the one I misplaced,it has a lot of potential to have fun with,especially on an electric plane, zero engine noise to attract attention. 
10593 the charger is okay but the batteries don t work but a few months. would not buy again 
10594 Great camera and SD card. Wasn t really buying it for anything else, but the tripod works pretty well too! Fantastic price point. 
10595 Gene Crawford 
10596 Good item 
10597 Wow from China. 
10598 Great product - works just like described -- 
10599 AMAZING AND THE SOUND DOES WORK!!! 
10600 like the colored borders 
10601 Old model camera. The case is too small for the camera with battery. Except for the camera, nothing is of the brand or description advertised. I paid $90 for expedite but I was not shipped for 2 days and by Snail mail. 
10602 Looks nice but it s not the most efficient. So if ur going for the looks, then go for it, but it s annoying when u want to take pictures 
10603 The camera seemed to work fine but it offered little adjustment possibilities, resulting in inconsistent and almost temperamental results. I supposed it might also have to do with the film available. 
10604 More than half of the joints broke, all at different times. Only used once. It s hard to try to turn or twist. Not worth it on my book. 
10605 Did not work!! 
10606 The sd card would not play on my Galaxy phone, the info on it said it would. 
10607 I love this follow focus ! Nice value for your money !!! It Is precise and works perfect after few mounts!!! Great product ! 
10608 Priced right works great.Was a bit concerned when I discovered that the rear hatch door on the expedition was all plastic rendering the magnet useless, but wait they included a Velcro sticky thing so all is well. Will update after our camping trip in the near future. 
10609 Worked as advertised for about a year or so....then the charge starts getting less and less. 
10610 good product 
10611 I have used this bag maybe five times and the zippers have failed. One zipper fell completely off and the other zipper popped out of the teeth; rendering the bag worthless. Look for another bag. 
10612 This camera delivered great pics on our vacation. The zoom capability is excellent for a moderately priced point-and-shoot model. Very happy with the purchase. 
10613 When I bought my GoPro, it only came with the waterproof housing. This housing actually lets the sound come through. 
10614 Works good 
10615 Good 
10616 Love my new camera and all of the goodies that came with it. It was shipped very quickly and everything was included as it was listed. Thanks for making my purchase easy and helping me capture many memories! 
10617 Perfect thank you 
10618 For the incredibly low price it is hard to complain but the product definitely feels like it costs- cheap. 
10619 This is just as good as the way more expensive clamps. It s versatile, strong construction, has a great grip. I trust it to hold my Zoom H6 if I want to boom it. So far hasn t budged an inch. 
10620 It s a cool-looking and resilient case 
10621 I just used one of the new my newly purchased batteries on a 7 day bear viewing trip. Although we didn t have non-stop photography, I was amazed that I didn t need to recharge the battery once during the week. I m VERY pleased with the product. 
10622 It s ok, you can t take a pic with it and it lets the phone tilt if you don t balance it perfectly. 
10623 A bit smaller than I would ve liked, but it s well made. Good for short photography trips! 
10624 Easily too use, give good colur. 
10625 one of the lights does not fit right. 
10626 Perfect for small fixed focal length lenses and teleconverters. I like that there are no plastic tabs or anything that rubs / chafes against other camera equipment. Very simple and very functional equipment protection. 
10627 Works great and you do have to iron the backdrops, no big deal. Want to learn how to close it, watch a youtube video they are out there and easy to find. 
10628 Not bad for the price! Feel like the lens could be clearer!! But all and all good deal!! 
10629 great item fast shipping thank you 
10630 Great for transferring your pictures to your phone and sharing on social media on the spot but just a heads up, if you shoot in raw the file sizes are large and can take a few minutes to transfer. 
10631 Met expectations. Great value for price. 
10632 Did not include the correct DVR. 
10633 it works, but not compatible with mine. 
10634 Nice frame, works beautifully, so simple to set up! 
10635 Too many issues with an off brand. Works great when it works but often finicky with the camera electronics. Sometimes just doesn t work 
10636 Great item. Great price for a very nice quality item. Thank you 
10637 Good value for money, good quality 
10638 So much fun to use for guests! 
10639 very good shipping, no problems A++ thanks Patrick 
10640 died after three months of use 
10641 Camera works great. The setup was very easy 
10642 Pretty good, looks durable! 
10643 The item arrived in reasonable time and was as described. There were Japanese import duties but I knew about them when I ordered. I wanted manuals etc for my camera to be in English rather than just Japanese. 
10644 Works great 
10645 Very good. 
10646 Exactly as advertised and the cheapest price around. It worked perfectly. 
10647 Works great!! 
10648 excellent 
10649 Best purchase of the year for me (400$). Awesome! 
10650 Better then the one that came with the camera 
10651 Amazing! Love it 
10652 Had purchased one a few months ago exact same one and the company would not take it back so we had to order this one ...It works great but we had to put the insides in it...it came with out the parts. 
10653 Very good product 
10654 Great 
10655 Good camera. Night vision is good 
10656 This tribrach has a iron items. I have been looked for tribrach with unmagnetic items and that it has items to brass or aluminium. Also screws are magnrtic item to iron. 
10657 Great monitor calibrator 
10658 Works as expected 
10659 Good quality. Clamp on stand difficult to open. Could use a sturdier stand but overall fine for my purpose. 
10660 The gentleman who received this as a gift is quite happy! 
10661 The product arrived before schedule without any damages. Very impressed. 
10662 Excellent tripod. Recording self-tapes has been so much easier with this. It has different levels and tons of different adjustments for any type of project you may do. 
10663 One of the lenses was messed up and not clear, and the clip had chips in it. Disappointed 
10664 I searched for the perfect strap. It is stylish, soft and durable. I love it. 
10665 Good replacement battery 
10666 Well made, no complaints here 
10667 Works great, sturdy with no problems. 
10668 Great value box. 
10669 thank you 
10670 Fit my camera perfect, and price was awesome. 
10671 No problems launching from grass now! 
10672 These work great for any screen. Gets it really clean. I normally use with my iPad & iPhone and have no complaints. Would repurchase. 
10673 works great on 1080 setting. what a cool camera. super easy to use. 
10674 Nice case. Fits in my pocket book. Has extra pockets for SD cards. 
10675 Wow! This is a great camera for my 10 year old daughter. She absolutely loves this camera and has the very best time capturing her own memories with it. 
10676 Nice little scanner for your old paper snapshots. The feed-through design and on-board storage make it easy to handle a large number of photos rapidly. It s a really good solution for those simply wanting to create a digital photo album. 
10677 Worked for about an hour, red light came on and that s it. Wouldn t reset, just a red &#34;I m dead&#34; light. 
10678 as expected nice case 
10679 A must have for extra batteries to keep at the ready. 
10680 The digital art was great. Nice and clear and good sorted in to easy to find and use groups. I have made several scrapbook pages for my self. 
10681 Do not buy this camera. It failed me after two weeks of use! The lens mechanism stopped working and no longer extends out. You are better off using your mobile phone camera! 
10682 god value 
10683 Best camera I ve ever had. I took pictures of the Pope in Rome and you would have thought I was standing next to him when I was way far away 
10684 I am very pleased with this lens...a good inbetween....got it before I needed it for wedding pictures....shipped as soon as she could.... 
10685 Cheap/inexpensive, but good. It s a small part so it doesn t have to be name brand. No one can notice that it isn t Canon. Fits and feels like stock. 
10686 Quality seems nice. Works as it should. Fits great. A great purchase! 
10687 THe zoom is not great, and I have had issues with pictures appearing pixculated. I am very aggravated with this camera. 
10688 Battery life doesn t seem to have alot of juice. The stock battery i received with my phantom 2 seems to last me longer! i dont think its what its advertised to be regarding longer battery life! 
10689 I recommend this product. I love it. Vary accessible. Not heavy. Light and easy to the hand. 
10690 Great battery and dual charger combination for the price. So far, the batteries have been decent on run times, and the dual charger makes charging much faster than the single unit that came with the camera. 
10691 Generally good product and easy to set up and configure. Main problem was that the unit I got was returned by another purchaser and the seller did not erase previous phone numbers from the memory, so alarms kept calling him! 
10692 wow! 
10693 pretty good price vs quality 
10694 WORKS GREAT. 
10695 Very good device for a beginner. Reasonably priced that will not hurt your budget. Lighting stand could be heavier or just use a sand bag. (Ankle weights could also work.) 
10696 It s Not sharp 
10697 I use this quite often, works well especially for the price.... 
10698 Camera is great but software that comes with it does not work. Took me several hours to get it to work 
10699 This is one of the best dash cams out there. This dash cam was easy to setup and get it running. Everything is working fine. I bought an extra one for my sister. 
10700 not at all what I thought it was. Returned 
10701 Received two different styles, one style was durable and easy to attach directions to for a wedding reception, the other one was like a cardboard box. Still waiting to see if pictures turned out. Fingers crossed! 
10702 It is working great for the long action shoots at the sporting events that I am coving 
10703 Cheap, but maybe deters the homeless. 
10704 This is the coolest tool a photographer could use. Great for long exposures and selfies 😁 
10705 Works perfectly. Good spare battery when you re doing lots of photos or video. 
10706 Device works fine, I just couldn t make the USB attachment work... 
10707 My grandaughter just loves this camera,she is six and can use this.thanks. 
10708 Works well. 
10709 Quick Delivery and came as stated!! 
10710 Good bunch of stuff for the gopro! Good quality 
10711 İt s worked well with Lumix FZ1000. 
10712 Nice bag Bought this for my new Canon DSL with extra lens. Has room for extra batteries, battery charger, manual. Includes shoulder strap and has good padding and divider to keep equipment from getting banged up. Good quality and great price. 
10713 Perfect fit for Sony Rx100 III. I have mine with screen protector + sony grip and it fits perfect. I also add 1 spare battery on the very bottom, the lid still closes but not 100%, more like 80%. 
10714 Works great. Very happy with it. I love the zoom function 
10715 hard to operate. 
10716 Great deal! I went to buy a second set and they were already out of stock. 
10717 Order arrived in time, works well with my Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS STM Lens, have not ran into issues. 
10718 Great buy! 
10719 nice camera but make sure to buy the micro SD card. no internal memory 
10720 Fast shipping works great for my cool pixels camera. 
10721 Reliable.... 
10722 fast shipping. works fine for my d7000 battery 
10723 amazing 
10724 Bought this for my small DSLR. It s much much smaller than I thought it would be. It s works fine for small cameras but if you have any type of DSLR, this absolutely will not work for you. 
10725 It fits and it s OEM. 
10726 I love this camera. It is easy to use the battery holds the charge for a long time. It fits in my pocket. I have purchased two cameras since but always go back to this one. 
10727 It s a battery. It works. 
10728 Just the right case for my newly purchased camera. Very handy and very compact... 
10729 Want to return but cannot and it does not work 
10730 Arrived broken. They insisted I watch their video on proper way to use. I ve been using these for 30 years. Broken is broken. Very, very low quality product. Not one you can count on. 
10731 Item arrived quickly and as described. So far so good is a great second battery! 
10732 Very well build, be aware that it does not hold the Gopro with the Wasabi extended battery. 
10733 Neither my wife or I found it comfortable and it made reaching the shutter release to cumbersome. We don t use it at all. 
10734 Not made well, very cheap looking. Got what I paid for. 
10735 Does the job. Comfortable yet slips from time to time. 
10736 the tow arms too short, the V-grove is too narrow, there is no way you can hang monitor and light and mike at the same time! 
10737 Brand new and fast shipping. 
10738 Received right one time like promised 
10739 Excellent choice. 
10740 It was a great purchase can t fault it superb really pleased 
10741 Really enjoying my first prime lens. Great value. A little disappointed that it arrived a day late. Thankfully, I wasn t leaving for my trip until the following day! 
10742 Great 
10743 Great 
10744 Really easy to use when you get water temp right great product 
10745 Gets the job done just fine. Anyone knows if i can use this adaptor with RZ67 lens? Or the RZ67 adaptor with RB67 lens? 
10746 great product keeps my go pro safe and secure with a great peace of mind .very pleased Thanks!! 
10747 good price and product. 
10748 It is awesome!!! 
10749 Nice collection of accessories but low quality of course! 
10750 Perfect, great quality at a rock bottom price! The customer service was Awesome too. 
10751 yes. Exact color of the photo. Nice quality as usual. 
10752 An excellent pouch to hold filters. Instead of 4 plastic filter holders you can condense them into one convenient holder. 
10753 Great 
10754 Deeper than what I needed, but this is a very good product. 
10755 Fits Sony RX-100 ii perfectly. 
10756 Works just like the orignal 
10757 Keeps my Nikon Coolpix floating and handy. It s great for the pool and getting those family shots. 
10758 This is a great little product for the price. Certainly worth the price. 
10759 smaller than I thought and it doesn t hold a lot. I have put the camera in a bigger bag and use this a protective case. 
10760 It s a great camera for the price hands down. Only down side is that it ll record only 10-12 min videos.... 
10761 Great cleaning tool for under $10 
10762 Poor! It doesn t value the money that I have paid. The head of tripod doesn t screw the Gopro. 
10763 Super Clear! 
10764 Fine product. Works as intended 
10765 These cameras are very buggy as they stop working all the time and have to unplug them the ptz doesn t as promised 
10766 It covers the flash connection. Enough said. 
10767 excellent. 
10768 Needed a lens cap with the leash so won t lose it and so far no lose! 
10769 Have had this bag for about a week, really like it. I have my Nikon D4 with my 80-400mm, 70-200mm, 27-70mm and my 14-24mm in this bag and it fits perfect. 
10770 For a GoPro with accessories this case is not near big enough. 
10771 This was a gift and My friend fell in love with the camera. 
10772 I threw it away :-( 
10773 Works seamlessly between my D610 and my iPhone 6+. Refurbished saved me money and shipping was fast and free! 
10774 Pretty good set for a good price. This set covers it all for beginners 
10775 It does what it say, and it awesome that its directional. The Gopro mount can actually pop out of the housing pretty easily. My buddy wiped out wake boarding and the gopro popped off. If you re going to use this for water sports MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A FLOAT! 
10776 Great battery for D750. Factory replacement. 
10777 love it small and compact ,just the right size for me and keeps my go pro safe. Thanks!! 
10778 Works as expected but needs a ball mount. Ordered ball mount today. 
10779 The price is certainly right! Just don t forget to turn them off when you re done. 
10780 Flimsy, but it gets the job done. 
10781 Awesome 
10782 works as needed 
10783 very good! 
10784 The charger was the wrong one for the batteries, so I didn t have a camera for my trip BOO 
10785 They re fine with me, no worries. 
10786 Received fast, great product!! Got this camera for my garage because I once received a notification that the garage door was open with no way to verify with absolute certainty. This camera works flawlessly and was very easy to setup and get running. It s wireless. Love it!! 
10787 Easy setup. 
10788 Works great! I am happy to have gotten this as I lost my charger! 
10789 Everything came just as expected. 
10790 Met my standards. Fast shipping 
10791 I have not used this product under water yet. I did take a couple of pictures with it and they were great. I purchased this camera for a trip to the Bahamas in January. I hope it takes great pictures and I hope it doesn t leak! 
10792 Love how this is built & would buy a 2nd one if I need it. 
10793 Nice leather strap. I wish it was 4&#34; longer, I m a big guy. works OK though. comes with everything you need to attach and protect the camera finish 
10794 The base is ok, but the little ball head is really flimsy/junky. I m using it to hold a small LED lite array, so I just superglued the ball in-place and am using the LED device s mount for movement. 
10795 lost the first charger a good replacement for sure. 
10796 Great battery ato a great price 
10797 Love at first sight. This is an amazing case and I knew I had to get this. 
10798 I got this for my Coolpix 500 camera and it works great! Also, delivery was very quick. I will order thru this site in the future. Thank You 
10799 very good but too expensive. $129..9 was a perfect price for it. 
10800 Great Product/Great Value. 
10801 very good quality, big upgrade in terms of design from the previous. 
10802 Excellent 
10803 Did not work for me, I am using a channel master +,dvr for tell me how to connect it. Help 
10804 Reasonable and so needed for this camera! 
10805 This is a great bargain for the money. Half of these things exceed the price alone and the quality is just as good. 
10806 Fast delivery, excellent brand 
10807 Works good smooth rotation, no distortion except at max 
10808 Easy and fun to use 
10809 Easy installation, works right away. I can now view remotely from my phone or desktop. 
10810 I think it s such a rip off that this item isn t included in the Vello light bouncer. It works well but, doesn t warrant the price. It should be included in the light bouncer. 
10811 Extremely good, my camera has been dropped, and it hasn t broken. 
10812 I thought this selfie stick was remotely control but they are not. 
10813 impressed! This was easily able to support my micro 4/3 panasonic gx 7 with the 9-18mm 4-5.6. Upright position only though! 
10814 Wonderful 
10815 This quick release clamp is used on my Jobu junior gimbal head. I just remove the gimbal arm and install the clamp to give me a side mounted head 
10816 works very well 
10817 excellent image quality 
10818 The threads of the screw that attach the plate to the camera all mess up. Thus, unable to use. Other than that, it s ok. 
10819 Great camera !! 
10820 Very bad item, used it one time and broke. 
10821 Can never have too much extra film on hand 
10822 Very nice product. If it weighed a little more, it would be an excellent product. But I m using it for a Note 4 phone, which is heavier than the GoPro. I Recommend it for it s intended purpose. 
10823 works great 
10824 Up to now, battery works correctly. 
10825 This full package was well thought and has all the items needed for a good photo service. The product was delivered on time with all the items as described on Amazon site 
10826 Great case and great price 
10827 Excellent and they came earlier than expected. Thank you. 
10828 Thank You! 
10829 Everything appears to be good quality products however some documentation would be nice. There was nothing at all and since there are a lot of individual parts I m really not sure what everything is for and how it fits together. 
10830 batteries worked fine, arrived promptly, and the charger, not available from the store where I bought the camera, is a nice bonus 
10831 It did not work for what it was supposed to work for, which was the sanza Clip 
10832 Good product but not the best quality, the head strap was loose which I cant fix my camera on. 
10833 Horrible does not work I would like my money back please ! 
10834 have it on my fishing rod. love it 
10835 Fantastic lens 
10836 Nothing but problems from this thing. From freezing to not coming on at all. Doesn t even record you whole drive. Only records when it feels &#34;vibrations&#34;... Well the sensor must be poopoo! Do yourself a favor and stay away 
10837 best camera !!! 
10838 Really nice package of converter rings. Decent quality for the money. Would buy again... 
10839 Works great, no problems 
10840 BETTER then expected excellent photos and long length movies taken with great clarity. ONLY option we would like to see id a snap on red lens filter, this would bring out the best of this product. 
10841 Solid lens for the price, hunts a little and motor noise can be heard during video sequences but and all around keeper 
10842 To easy to OPEN, slight knock and it flips up 
10843 It wasn t strong enough for my use. 
10844 The product didn t even reach me. 
10845 Works the same as the original charger, but I like this one more as it comes with a car DC plug to charge while on the road! 
10846 Bought for my brother and he loves it and uses it when he skateboards and bikes at skateparks. 
10847 By far my favorite and definitely most versatile gopro mount Can literally mount this to anything! 
10848 nice soft ring just what I wanted 
10849 I used this with a one channel dvr in the car, and it works great 
10850 This backpack is amazing! I love it. I switched from a Canon over the shoulder case to this, and I am absolutely thrilled with the decision. It was long overdue. 
10851 Products are awesome, great quality, fast Shipping, unfortunately I had 2 missing lens at the time that the box arrived but other than that. Great Products. 
10852 Performs as the original Nikon QR foot does. Quick to put and take off. I like the rubber coated tightening knobbed compared to Nikon s. Great value compared to Nikon OEM, 4X less cost! Only time will reveal whether it is as robust as the Nikon. 
10853 Great camera system easy to install 
10854 Love it. 
10855 A very cost effective alternative to the official GoPro version 
10856 very sturdy, easy to install. Little pricey on the import duties. 
10857 The battery lasted 6 weeks in a device designed to run for 5 years before replacing the battery. A bad product! 
10858 I can t believe all of the good quality gear you get for such a low price. Everything works great and makes the Gopro so much more versatile. Definitely a great buy. 
10859 For the price this is a good tripod. It may need to be oiled if you want to turn it easily for panning shots. 
10860 Bought this to add two more cameras to security system. Works good 
10861 great product works great 
10862 Very good 
10863 Great clip! 
10864 No battery cover useless as is 
10865 The battery works beautifully. No complaints. 
10866 I received a completely different camera than what is shown in the pictures 
10867 This item clearly shows a 2nd part in the bike handle bar mount position photo. The description and images are misleading. 
10868 Perfect lens. 
10869 The first day we used this product on set, 2 of three screws holding &#34;Sticks&#34; together came loose and we had to use gaffers tape to hold it together. I went to hardware store and replaced screws and it still falls apart. Do Not waste your time with this product! 
10870 Worked as expected! Only draw back: No instructions for cage assembly! 
10871 I like it and would buy it again. 
10872 Great base for my Benro Transfunctional tripod. Now I can convert my tripod s removable leg into a monopod. 
10873 an accessory for every type of activity 
10874 Good, inexpensive after-market replacement. 
10875 Great Product, Just as Described!!! 
10876 Item arrived as described. Quick ship. Highly recommend!! 
10877 Love love love! Set up is easy. No cables. Totally wireless 
10878 Great action camera for a cheaper price. Thumbs up.👍 
10879 I was hoping to be able to have some sort of focus option and be able to zoom. There aren t many times this camera will be very useful. 
10880 Works fine. 
10881 Outstanding underwater camera holder. I used it while diving and it was everything that the manufacturer claims it to be. Worked like a charm. 
10882 Typical excellent Canon quality. This has been a great addition to my collection. 
10883 I&#34;ll recommend to anyone buy this product 
10884 Great Items.. My customers are really happy... 
10885 We love it, but would be nice if it could move around the room by using an option. but it is great 
10886 Love it. thanks red giant. 
10887 Great case, flexible inside pocket is adjustable, heavily padded yet lightweight. 
10888 Very good and chsrges fast 
10889 It works 
10890 They arrived fast and work perfect!! 
10891 Works great. 
10892 Love them great clairity for a resanable price 
10893 Best one 
10894 This is a great monitor with a clear picture and very good quality. If you have a high end security system then you need a good clear monitor to go with it. Old monitors can change the quality of your picture coming from the security cameras through your DVR. 
10895 The package was a gift, so it s not fair that I rate it. I can say that everything that was included in the offer arrived on time and was in brand new condition. The person receiving the gift was very excited and continues to enjoy using it. 
10896 Very cheaply made, not intuitive at all. But the real reason for the one star is that after two months it stop working, now all the pictures look almost white, impossible to distinguish anything. 
10897 Awesome inexpensive light ring, the only con is that you can t use full range of your wide angle or wide angle zoom lens because the ring will crop the borders of the image. 
10898 i love this camera. it is replaces an older model from 10 years ago. easy to handle. takes great pictures. the accessories are an extra bonus which avoid having to purchase them separately. canon products are very durable. 
10899 Wasn t quite what I thought I ordered 
10900 Outstanding Item and fast shipping. 
10901 It s a good camera when it works, but sometimes we have had to call for tech support. However, they have been very helpful. 
10902 decent arch support for my feet. I wear them all the time. Like the style and looks, have held up well so far. 
10903 Thing works like it s designed but the lens cover (rounded piece) doesn t fit the lens hood so it s really stupid. I had another issue where the ring got stuck to my lens and had to get some tools to take it off. 
10904 It s cute and very convenient. 
10905 Thanks, it s perfect, very reasonable price too. 
10906 It is ok, although I had big troubles using AAA batteries it is really annoying because they don´t fit perfectly. 
10907 Had to return as it would pair with my Blackberry Z10 but seemed to interrupt other functions on my phone and too hard to figure out for me - didn t have time to waste to figure it out. Time to change to another phone probably... 
10908 I love everything about this camera, I upgraded from a T3i. Great kit lens very pleased. 
10909 Great Product 
10910 Absolutely great buy!!! Love having my charging dock and the extra batteries so I can just switch them out quickly! Batteries work just as good as the ones that came with the camera 
10911 I love this film sheets! They are the perfect size to keep on my wallet. I ordered the 20 film sheets and they arrived in 2 days!!!!! I was really surprised! Im definitely going to buy more!! 
10912 tried off brand before - it didn t work. Only the Fuji brand seems to work as replacement 
10913 Was not disappointed. 
10914 BOUGHT IT FOR GRANDDAUGHTERS BIRTHDAY, SHE ABSOLYELY LOVES IT! HER PICTURES ARE AWESOME. 
10915 Solid case for new Phantom. Backpack is deep enough to fit everything securely. Enough cutouts and pockets to fit all my gear. 
10916 Price on these are great. I ll update later if they don t last as long as expected. 
10917 Works like a charm. 
10918 Not made to accept the qd 1.5 loops......the sling is a closed unit.........you can not add them on 
10919 Product does not work. I sent it back. 
10920 OK 
10921 great little camera! 
10922 The camera looks *generally* as advertised. However, the &#34;30 LEDs&#34; is false advertisement. Inserting batteries causes a single red LED to light up, and even then it only blinks. In no way does it look like faux IR. I would not purchase this again. 
10923 easy to add working great 
10924 It s a great kit for your gopro heros 
10925 Everything fits and works as it should :) A bunch of extra unnecessary things are included in order to increase the appeal but It beats paying for the original GoPro pieces and they work just as well! 
10926 It does the job of a lens protector without sacrificing image quality at a great price. 
10927 these work great - will be buying additional items for other cameras and similar items with straps 
10928 Good Camera... Great Picture... Easy Operation From both PC and Android (Apple ????? not my way).. Note: camera ID is in Low Case... NOT Upper Case as shown in the instruction. 
10929 This kit was exacty what I needed and I am very pleased with my purchase. I would recommend this company and this product. 
10930 It lasts for hours, which is great since the batteries that I had did not last much. 
10931 Excellent product, it is rescue my waterproof camera is alive again. 
10932 Fast shipping and quality product. 
10933 If you are an actor in this day and age you are likely taping your own auditions. This is the best deal on the internet. You don t have to be a lighting or grip guy to figure this stuff out. Get this product asap. 
10934 Good as expected 
10935 Bought it from PoEDepot and got an American UL listed version. Will buy again! 
10936 amazing 
10937 Great filter, using it on my 50mm and 24mm Canon lenses to take some excellent long exposure photography. 
10938 I haven t used my camcorder in years because the battery wouldn t hold a charge. At a discounted price I can now capture the first s of my toddler. 
10939 I have installed it in a tennis complex. Absolutely worth every penny. For the price you cannot get better. The quality of the images are top notch plus i got a 500gb Hard disk with it. 
10940 Very helpful 
10941 Yup it pops on the front of my lens and does whatever a tulip lens hood is supposed to do. I dunno all the pros have them so I figured I should too. Gives me some street cred and that it worth every penny. 
10942 Not much more to say, functioned exactly as described. Build quality seems solid and has no trouble rotating the weight of my Canon SL1 
10943 Easy to install and the quality of the video is decent. Although the apps do crash frequently. 
10944 My son told me this one was the best one to get. I take a lot of pictures for my online store and it works great. I been using it daily. 
10945 Arrived on time and as shown, used only to do a few splash shots. 
10946 Great for the price. Definitely worth having in my bag to trigger a small flash. I found that it caught the light pretty easily within a relatively close distance. 
10947 The first time I use camera, I try to install, I personally think it s very good 
10948 It looks fake. I did find these at Best Buy cheaper. 
10949 A++ 
10950 Just used it for ziplining 
10951 The kits gives you everything you need to keep your camera clean. 
10952 I have used everything that came in this pack. I wouldn t encourage the selfie stick as there are much better options (like the GoPole). However, this whole package is incredibly useful and anything in this is worth the cost. 
10953 Great Thank you 
10954 Good deal and quality ,love will order more 
10955 Fits well, does what it s supposed to do 
10956 Pic nice and clear and easy to use-straight out the box with two cords done. I just wish it didn t lean no way to adjust 
10957 Item delivered on time, was as described 
10958 It s handy having an extra battery around! It keeps its charge very well. 
10959 Great buy! 
10960 Good 
10961 Very comfortable to use and keep my hands free. Hand are not getting tired on caring gear and shoulder doesn t hurt. 
10962 compact and great 
10963 This does not fit the go pro 3 housing. The black frame alining is different from this LED housing. Simply put it doesn t fit 
10964 Quality stuff right here !! Well worth the asking price for everything you get !!! I loved mine !! 
10965 Albert Ferman was the tech who helped us set up the camera. He was very helpful and explained all my questions clearly and showed us all the functions.. Very patient and courteous on phone as well. Happy with the product. 
10966 Perfect combo for a small price. 
10967 Spend the extra money and get the brackets that are made out of metal, these are plastic and I had a brand new strobe hit the floor because of them. They just don t tighten down enough on the flash shoe to keep it from moving and sliding. 
10968 the batteries do not hold a charge 
10969 Charged once I received them went to used them a month later they did not hold a charge 
10970 Very good quality. Works just as expected and has a large amount of adjustment 
10971 Fit perfectly! Thanks!! 
10972 Great 
10973 Minimal distortion, this thing has become my favorite lens for walk around, and landscapes. Totally worth every penny. 
10974 Henry was a great tech. Got me up and running in no time. Works great. 
10975 I got this for my girlfriends camera and she loves it. She lost her lens cap, so she uses this to keep the dust off on a constant basis. Its been about two months and the cleaner hasn t broken down and the brush hasn t lost any bristles. 
10976 Bought this lens kit for my daughter and she loves it! 
10977 Wonderful product. 
10978 Good product for the money. Display software needs work. You cannott zoom or clip areas for motion detection. You cannot delere individual pictures. You must reformat the whole memory stick. Good quality video,say or night. 
10979 GoPro adaptor for aux mic. I have a ton of these. All good. 
10980 I use it for carrying tripods and lights for filming. 
10981 Seem to work fine. 
10982 Don t buy the dome port without this. In fact, KNEKT should not sell them separately - makes no sense. The cover fits perfectly and is 100% essential. 
10983 saved my bacon on a recent install 
10984 Great case..like it a lot holds everything well..if you use the blade guards it is a very tight fit to get the arms in with the attachment at the end of the arms..over all it s a good back pack case.. 
10985 No problems so far....good value. 
10986 great. 
10987 Looks awesome and feels great especially when I put the larger lenses on. 
10988 Great buy. Fits my sony video camera perfectly 
10989 I was reluctant at first because of the price, you get what you pay for. But it is better than expected. 
10990 Canopy sent me a download that was illegible. I requested one in print someone could read. As of this date they have refused to send a legible copy, so I am cancelling the plan. 
10991 It s a little heavy and I have a difficult time using to take clear pictures of my moving kids. but overall it is a great telephoto. the rest of the package is just a bonus. 
10992 Great mount for the Xiaomi! 
10993 fast shipping and i love this camera so far the battery life lasts pretty long and i love all the features it has :) 
10994 Very easy to set up, very good for the price 
10995 Great Lens for the price - no noise in the corners - for an inexpensive wide angle it s impressive... 
10996 Product works great! I broke the one that came with my camera, and this was a good match! Great price and it turned my frown upside down. 
10997 For the price and what this does! Get 1 of these and they transmit to each other Talks to other receivers also, Get it. Brands don t matter when it comes to flashes. 
10998 great product 
10999 Very good bundle 
11000 Fast delivery very happy 
11001 Camera is well built and takes excellent photos and videos. Not user friendly to transfer photos. Pain in the neck for this part. 
11002 There were no instructions included and we never could get it to focus correctly. Maybe it s just our incompetence, but it is sitting on a shelf. Thank you for your interest. 
11003 Good new for Sony a3000 with high speed sync 1/4000s on camera shoe with neewer NW-985C E-TTL. It just flash...no zoom or communication with camera..it can not shoot high speed sync on sony a7r. Why? Funy for Sony with build the same universal hot shoe. 
11004 Camera is compact and great for filming. 
11005 way better performance with low light resolution or zoom focus than similar NKon - good to have a grip too 
11006 Worked perfect for our white water rafting trip! 
11007 Bought it to fit 2 - 21.5&#34; iMacs. They fit great! I tried to fit a third and it barely didn t fit. Great case though! 
11008 For the price you get more than I expected. I thought it would be cheap quality but it works well, video quality is very good and have not had any problems at all 
11009 As advertised ! 
11010 Good capacity. 
11011 Works great. Using it on two different Sony A65 lenses. 
11012 Great price and lots of great GoPro gear! 
11013 perfect fit 
11014 very good 👍 
11015 Item was as described and the actual product was in new condition. But the actual package it was is had been opened. You could clearly see the original tapping had been teared on all sides. Luckily the product works fine. 
11016 Very sturdy case. 
11017 Good quality cable and the extra adapters a great plus 
11018 Love the extended tightening screw. Works great. 
11019 This was a good purchase. 
11020 Good performance; good price point 
11021 Great little camera. 
11022 Just as described-very nice. 
11023 Great product, just v wish it had mini USB instead of micro USB. Other than that it s a winner. 
11024 Exactly what I needed 
11025 Works wonderful 
11026 Canon has a 1 year warranty that they have honored for me numerous times. I buy Nikon now. Either way, you don t really need this. 
11027 nice cheap alternative to big dollar GOPRO mount does what it is supposed to do 
11028 The product is of good quality and works as described. 
11029 works well 
11030 Worked as expected 
11031 Very good overall, just the battery life is poor.should use AA battery 
11032 They are a piece of s*** they re no good I m sorry to say that 
11033 Super mirrorless camera. 
11034 Great kit, very nice quality. 
11035 Have not used the ballhead extensively so far, but everything seems fine so far. Appears sturdy and supports my camera very well. 
11036 Great camera for the money, no complaints so far 
11037 Very cool camera. I ve had a lot of fun playing around with it. It takes great video and the sound works well even with the case on. Here is a neat trout video: &#60;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/i2oxFU3u1uU&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&#62;&#60;/iframe&#62; 
11038 Perfect entry level SLR 
11039 Took about three weeks to get it... They re pretty thin packs. 
11040 This product works as expected and is well built. 
11041 The one I purchased from an another store but it was a GoPro Suction Cup Mount non the less. The camera would shack and not allow for smooth filming. 
11042 Absolute Junk. Could not get this camera to be recognized by the dlink software. Followed all instructions, tried both WPS and wired methods, tried both a desktop and a laptop. 
11043 Can t even tell it s a refurb! Auto focus works on my d3000 & 5100! I have no complaint! I am happy with the price and the product! I plan to order this for my assistant to use. 
11044 Very good quality. Was impressed until i saw a big dot on my recorded videos. It is stuck inside the lense and not outside the lense. We ll see when i get my replacement item. 
11045 A real piece of junk, a waste of good money. Used it twice and the small metal connectors at the bottom that make contact with the battery broke, it s real garbage! 
11046 Can t find anything to complain about. Brush hairs are soft and does not fall out. Brush retracts into unit to make it compact and cover prevents hair from getting dirty. What else can one ask for? 
11047 It s worth what I paid for it. 
11048 Thank You 
11049 Nice! 
11050 Mine came broken I can t even use it because the metal part of the strap is broken 
11051 works like a battery should work 
11052 I give this to all my clients. 
11053 This is a great product!! I paid for mine $85.00 with free shipping, received it within 1 week of order. Picture quality is great, and really simple installation. I love the 2 in 1 screen. With this product in an accident or driving complaint, I am covered. Highly recommended!! 
11054 This was an excellent camera until it sat for a while. Now it will not charge from the battery. I called a shop and they said they can t get parts from Kodak and not to buy any more Kodaks. $500 camera down the drain! 
11055 Very good product 
11056 Great 
11057 Works great, fits around my NX3000 (without the detachable flash). Should be enough to protect my camera while traveling around Europe. 
11058 Batteries and charger both worked great. Batteries worked good in my Nikon Coolpix S3700. 
11059 Very Nice 
11060 I love this little guy. I use a ton of tripods and this little guy fits anywhere. Great price and awesome features with the remote. I totally recommend. I received this for review at no cost. Opinion is 100% mine. 
11061 What a great case! Very sturdy and holds everything you need to have a great day at the beach or anywhere else. 
11062 Nice 
11063 Great experience & great shipping 
11064 This float works wonderfully. 
11065 I like for those time when needed and for my go pro session convenient and yet secure. Thanks!! 
11066 This is so wonderful for long distance families, its great for grandparents. 
11067 Great batteries! Excellent value! Will buy again! 
11068 Works as needed! Good product 
11069 Perfect case for the GoPro! I use it for my GoPro Hero+ LCD, and it fits the camera plus all of the necessary accessories perfectly. It s sturdy and also small enough to fit inside my backpack. Overall, great case! 
11070 does just what its supposed to do 
11071 Great Product 
11072 Works like the original. 
11073 First one I ordered was D.O.A. but the company has a good return policy. I got a full refund. Decided to give it another try. New camera pen works great! 
11074 good product 
11075 Works well on my diatone 250 quad. Bigger board than the other FPV cameras I ve had so I didn t even need to zip tie it. It just fits perfectly! 
11076 It works perfect and i m on horseback with a lot of movement. 
11077 Small bag. Not enough to accessories. 
11078 Fits my canon! 
11079 I have never taken better portraits. It seems to make skin look smooth and perfect. Although, a baby s skin is pretty much perfect. Great little camera. 
11080 Excellent , dose everything it advertises 
11081 I bought it help with a special needs child. 
11082 Thank you 
11083 Excellent one 
11084 Bought as a gift for my father. It uses motion detectors to turn itself on, which is very creepy and disturbing at night. But the display is beautiful. 
11085 Love it ... using it for my elderly mother in a mother in law suite! 
11086 Just what was needed for the project; wide angle and fast lens. 
11087 Gift for dad. He loved it 
11088 Very portable and good viewing. The tripod is a bit flimsy but I guess Ok for the price, hence 4 stars 
11089 Broke at application. 
11090 I think bean bag filler works best with a mixture of these beads for light weight and heavier material like sunflower seeds. 
11091 Why buy just the lens when you receive so much more for the same price? 
11092 It was good but not what I want it but it s really good came a week early 
11093 great for travel; used on a safari and it was no burden to carry along 
11094 this didn t work for me or my Nikon d5300. Of course I didn t try it right away so, I am beyond the 30 day return period. Charger indicates a full charge but when I put it in the camera, it is not charged. 
11095 Great reponse time, arrived in New Zealand 
11096 It has a pretty long life and it flies easily! 
11097 Very difficult to get to work right. 
11098 Great for underwater Video. With the monopod the fish are not afraid of the camera. You can get great shots. Love the way the pod extends. Flip up the lever and extend the pod. 
11099 Awesome and great for filming!!!! 
11100 Exactly What I Wanted. It s GREAT ! 
11101 Thought it was rubber material. It s actually plastic. I m assuming it ll still float okay. 
11102 But keep misplacing damn things. 
11103 works great at first and then it started making this weird beep sound now it doesnt work 
11104 Great Camera case. 
11105 light and easy to pack. good 
11106 Nice wireless camera. Setup was easy and the smartphone app is pretty good 
11107 Magnificent! 
11108 Very satisfied with purchase, 
11109 VERY GOOD LAST LONGER. I RECOMENDED 
11110 Nice kit. 
11111 You need to hunt down required accesories and build this one yourself to get it to work - of you can find the right parts outside of London 
11112 I thought it would take 2 of them to float my Nikon AW130 but 1 does the job with capacity to spare! 
11113 Not Canon Brand, but it does the job nicely. 
11114 Loved it and arrived on time. Easy to use and upload photos. 
11115 Great product. Like, it s a good buy. I would buy it again. 
11116 AC adapter died a few weeks after the warranty expired but besides that; its a great camera. 
11117 Good camera for the money. The box is sturdy (industrial) and the design is simple. My only complaint is the shipping time... almost 3 weeks seems a little long. 
11118 This is decent for the price however, it burns through batteries like crazy! 
11119 Holds everything for my Hero 3+ perfectly. No longer need to go hunting around for anything. 
11120 They work great 
11121 Buy the right size bag, put my equipment is very good, prices are affordable. 
11122 Great charger, charges better than the Sony charger. 
11123 this had everything I needed for dslr cleaning - works great - would recommend 
11124 Works like a charm, and that is all that matters. You cant complain about the price either. 
11125 Does the job and can t beat the price. 
11126 Perfect love them 
11127 Just as described--and just what I needed--with perfect shipping! Thanks so much! 
11128 We use this backdrop to take pictures of the dogs and cats at the animal shelter that I volunteer for. It is a volunteer favorite. We do put a white bead board on the ground for the floor instead of the wood. 
11129 I still dont get what it does, it does not fit in my GoPro Hero 4 Silver, but its a cool keychain and bottle opener

11131 [[ASIN:B00JAJ9U8K Vimtag (Fujikam) 361 HD, IP/Network ,Wireless, Video Monitoring, Surveillance, security camera,plug/play, Pan/Tilt with Two-Way Audio and Night Vision]] Honestly…….. one of the easiest items I have ever setup. Very clear step by step directions in package. Pretty much plug and play. Love it! 
11132 Great bag. Can cary everything that I want with room to spare. 
11133 works great innovative design 
11134 crash pack is essential 
11135 Cheap plastic, never worked as intended. Can hold two batteries but only pulls from one at a time. 
11136 LVR is fine for my hero 4, but cannot charge while your recording with case, I prefer the non lcd vesion 
11137 Vincent was awesome technical support! Highly recommend this product over the more costly options (home security systems, etc.)! 
11138 IT took OK pictures then died after 2 days. The camera would power up but crash when taking a photo. 
11139 I was so excited when I got this cables. After 2 week of used the connection that screws into the camera broke. I am very disappointed.. please do yourself a favor and don t spend your hard working money on this crappy cables. 
11140 I received the camera and the only way to charge it is thru the camera. Also 1 battery was bad out of the 3 
11141 I have used this product for over twenty years and are perfect for security lighting systems that can be controlled from anywhere in the house, with an X-10 control unit. 
11142 A great camera. Feels like a real camera in the hands. The only reason why I didn t give it five stars is because of the problem endemic to all digitals, the lag time on the shutter. 
11143 This is an excellent kit for the price. I bought it mainly for two spare batteries. Batteries always seem to &#34;go dead&#34; when you least expect it. Can t beat this deal. 
11144 This cameras are just poorly made. Either they reset, send me an email every minute or I cannot connect to them. Nothing but headaches. Thank god I only bought two. Don t waste your money on these. 
11145 Fast delivery as usual and it is just what I wanted for my New Nikon, Thank you very much & I will be sure to use you in the future. 
11146 It is a great product for cleaning glasses. 
11147 Great travel tripod could not believe how small it folds up to.Very strong for being so light. Highly recommended 
11148 this is a gift, looks like it will work perfectly - it would be nice to have an instruction booklet 
11149 They send me defect one...I will never buy this again 
11150 Was very easy to set up (especially for a new photographer) but the box was missing one of the backdrops and only had one umbrella and NO RETURNS by the time I got back in town to realize it was missing pieces from the package. 
11151 excellent product. 
11152 No comments 
11153 Good watch for the value! Would buy again! 
11154 Replacement batteries for my camera, work great, thanks. 
11155 The sound quality blows my mind 
11156 Works very well & the price is great as well 
11157 Good 
11158 Great. Hate the viewfinder. 
11159 First time using this flash on my Nikon D3200 the flash was stuck on the hot shoe. Small ball bearing on bottom of flash would not retract all the way so it would not release the flash. Had to bring it in to have it removed. Poor quality. 
11160 This product is exactly what I needed. I ve been shoot for over half a century and finally decided that I was going to have some fun creating my scenes. This product was shipped immediately and appears to be a great quality for the price. 
11161 Yes they work, but the adhesive is horrible and does not stick. Ended up having to use 3M double sided tape to attach one mount to my daughters helmet. 
11162 Product is well built and study. Light weight and very versatile, and the carry bag is perfect. 
11163 exactly as described.. 
11164 Works well, doubles as an iphone and a GoPro stick. 
11165 Love this one! 
11166 This item was perfect for my iPhone 
11167 Great batteries at a fraction of the cost of originals....Work great and hold a charge! 
11168 very good and fast service would order again 
11169 Works well, and glad to have a protective filter on my Panasonic DMC-LX7. But, really, Panasonic should have just made the lens barrel filter ready, rather than compelling one to buy another item... 
11170 A neat item but was defective screws were never installed properly. 
11171 Good & it is my need. Thanks! 
11172 I am about to buy a few more of these... Just what I needed for my Sigma 50-500 OS. The QR plate that came with my Airhed ballhead was just not cutting it. For under $10, this thing is solid! 
11173 This camera is okay for a basic camera and for the price. Day shots are good, night not so good. Poor quality build. It s good for travel. 
11174 Darkhorse accommodated by request for special shipping so I could get these albums by my wedding day. We used them as our guest book and they were great! Darkhorse communicated quickly by email and helped me get what I needed, on time, for no additional cost. 
11175 Works great. Exactly what I expected 
11176 It works well with practically any camera or tripod, and picks up sound quite nicely. 
11177 Arrived quickly and works exactly as intended. 
11178 Excellent product! I use this diffuser almost exclusively with my canon flash. It provides excellent balanced diffused light for a variety of flash applications. If you only buy one difusser, this is it! 
11179 Great camera. Very easy to use. Takes good underwater pictures and video. Very good product for the price. 
11180 Battery charged right up and fits fine. 
11181 Good！！！ 
11182 Arrived on time and equipment was exactly as offered. Great product, great service, great value!!Only needed charger but for less than the cost of a stand alone charger I got a charger 2 extra batteries and a car charger cord!!! 
11183 These pieces are swell, great experience from seller! 
11184 Love it 
11185 Beautiful. It is perfect for my needs. 
11186 used it couple of times and found ok 
11187 I recieved the slide converter 1 day early the amazom box was in perfect condition. But package box was slightly damaged but did not affect operation of device. Just started using but don t know about relibility right now works as described. 
11188 they work 
11189 On time and as promised! 
11190 Beautifully designed - perfect 
11191 Great video cam. It gives you two hours of time and the pictures are easy to upload. No sim card needed. I swear by Flipshare! 
11192 Fit my T3i lens kit perfectly. 
11193 Best camera backpack on the market. I have tried a lot of different bags and this one is the best. Size is just right for day hikes. 
11194 item arrived promptly and as represented. only used once so far and performed as needed. thanks 
11195 Amazing 
11196 It s really just neat... not necessary but cool. I use it with the D5500 
11197 item was directly as describe 
11198 Nice Fit, Well made! love it! 
11199 They work great with both my 60d and the 70d. 
11200 Great camera! Great quality and tons of accesories. Works great so far! 
11201 These worked for me. i have them on my slider, my shoulder rig, my tripod, and its really nice to just swap my camera between all these with no need to change the plate. 
11202 perfect, quick delivery! 
11203 This is great when I am traveling and have my kids with me and only want to take one camera body and one lens (and still need to tote their sunglasses and my wallet, etc. 
11204 I am satisfied 
11205 I think the hardware is great but the software is complete trash. This device is unsuitable for security due to the fact that the motion detection has not been enabled in the app yet. Push notifications for motion detection does not work. Returned and refunded. 
11206 Perfect case. Great price! 
11207 This camera is very well built and the customer service Walter provided to set it up on pc and tablet was super. Thanks for a great product and service! 
11208 Small, simple to use and setup; does what it says it will. What s not to like. GoPro offers decent software for editing. So far it s been bulletproof 
11209 Good product, timely delivery, works as intended, Good price. Durability? So far so good…. 
11210 Not only was this NOT a plug & play device it is plastic cheap Xhina made. Even their Level 2 support cld not fix - wasted THREE HOURS! Returned & bought Nest (drop) cam which is AWESOME wyality & indeed installed instantly!!! Get a Nest cam!!! 
11211 This backdrop stand is excellent and well constructed. I am very pleased with it and would recommend it. 
11212 Not made for the camera it was pictured with. 
11213 Great product. Great quality and stylish. The seller shipped on time as well. 
11214 Complete junk, waste of everything, just a scam 
11215 Great Value 
11216 This has been a great addition to my equipment. It is the just the right size for when I am shooting still life and macro photos. When shooting portraits it can easily be held by your model without interfering in close ups. 
11217 It Fit like the original hood. So far I am not disappointed. Would buy again. 
11218 GREAT 
11219 GREAT PRODUCT. RECOMENDT IT. 
11220 It was broken! so bad!!!! 
11221 It was worth my Lil change 
11222 t I don t like the instruction book being online. Haven t figured out how to view photos online. 
11223 Love it! Keep an eye on my dog throughout the day! 
11224 As described and delivers promptly 
11225 Works as described. Target and Walmart sell an exact monopod for around 45 dollars USD. Have not got it wet yet but cheap enough to buy two, one for the water and land. As plus it comes with a GOPRO tripod mount. (score) 
11226 Is a nice product, nicely build. The only problem is the foot holder, It doesnt stay up. At the end I removed from the Monopod. 
11227 Lenses were a great deal for the price. Seem to be quality. Definitely would buy again 
11228 we should all have them at home never know when you need them 
11229 Excellent product. 
11230 My order arrived as promised. The D5300 manual is well written and the camera easy to assemble with very intuitive controls. With accessories, this is a ready to shoot package for beginners and experts. 
11231 Camcorder worked well although there was some pixiling after using Digital Video Head Cleaner everything worked out well, good buy, satisfied. 
11232 Product received, as scheduled, and is just as it is advertised. I am very pleased. 
11233 works really well when it s working, my son loves it. It does what it describes, fly really well for a $50 drones. But one of the propeller fails after a few days of heavy use. It becomes useless if one of the propeller fails. 
11234 These batteries do work, but don t fit into the slots as easily as the originals. The batteries don t seem to hold as long either. 
11235 DOA Returned. 
11236 I love this flash! It was inexpensive and does the job I need it to do. 
11237 Good 
11238 Arrived on time and fit right onto the standard lens for the nikon 1 s1. Works great to reduce lens flare. 
11239 This remote works with my Nikon D3100 perfectly. 
11240 Awkward to use. Takes three hands to align the hood properly. 
11241 Perfect exactly the expected 
11242 Was wondeful, gave the camera the grip it needed 
11243 Gift 
11244 Love old school Polaroids 
11245 Great stuff! Works as expected and protects your gopro from occasional loss 
11246 Now I am always strapped for when things get messy. 
11247 it lasts long enough!! :) 
11248 Honestly there are so many uses for this product! We use it in pools the ocean while spearing, surfing, body surfing and just catching family fun. Thanks again for the great product. 
11249 Good camera, but returned it as there is no real flash. It comes with a little toy one that looks like an after thought. Great pictures in good light, but there are better options for a little more money. 
11250 Sturdy little cap. The string isn t adjustable, so it s kind of useless but doesn t get in the way much. 
11251 Absolutely love my new Canon! It s exactly what I wanted and all the added items are great, especially the case. 
11252 They are working fine. Thanks. 
11253 Came fast. fit great in the camera and work perfectly. 
11254 I love this set of reflectors, very pleased! 
11255 Great case, holds everything I need. No complaints 
11256 Its OK the battery doesn t fit all the way in the charger 
11257 the case is not solid red. it is fully clear. the only thing red is the rubber liner that is inside. it will fit 2x iPhone 6 w/ cases on, a wallet, some keys, and pocket knife. 
11258 Packed full of capability. A real bargain. At first the latest software did not allow me to register on Lenovo tab, but they quickly remedied the problem. 
11259 Excellent camera for a point and shoot. The camera has many great features only found on more expensive cameras. The photo quality is excellent. 
11260 Dose not work at all. If cane tack back the one stare I will 
11261 Should have came with lens ( Canon ) 
11262 Nice price. 
11263 Battery life is terrible. Should have looked around for better camera. Price was ok, videos clear. 
11264 instructions not very good, could not get the audio to work properly. 
11265 Works well but kinda stiff, I like my backpack style better. Larger and bulkier than expected. I find I use the inside case more than the whole thing. 
11266 Flawless. 
11267 Great 
11268 Great Compact case. Perfect for those who do not need to carry around a bunch of different lenses. 
11269 easy to use 
11270 Works like it should 
11271 Not bad for the price, it doesn t work really well with my d810 but is pretty handy for smaller cameras, (I cant reach all the neccasary buttons on the larger dslrs) 
11272 Great item 
11273 Well they are Sony lens caps which is what I needed. 
11274 Total Junk Camera s do NOT buy... they didn t work, period.... fuzzy picture for a while then no picture 
11275 High quality well made compact unit. Easy to carry and use. 
11276 Well made pouches. I prefer these to the larger cases because they can be packed anywhere. 
11277 Works fine but loose in socket 
11278 It works as it should. 
11279 Perfect! Just what I needed for my next project! 
11280 Canon top quality & has the space I need. Only objection I have is the lack of a zippered top closure instead of the Velcro fastener option. It s noises & I don t feel as secure with my gear without a zipper closure. Maybe just me 
11281 Too small for necklaces, and not enough lighting even in a brightly lit room. Otherwise great product. 
11282 Doesn t take great out of water photos, but hints why it s an underwater camera! 
11283 Nice 
11284 love it 
11285 Does the job, like the price! 
11286 Hah Go Pro nervana 
11287 Excellent camera took great vacation photos 
11288 Bought it for a gift. My daughter was thrilled!! 
11289 Nice frame i make my wife happy with this frame with all our goo moments & memories 
11290 Fits perfectly into my Okley backpack 
11291 Perfect 
11292 Used to replace two flooded o. e. cams out of 8 in my system. Exceeded expectations for a unit with this low price. Much better resolution and color rendition than o.e.., and much better mounting brackets. Will use them in the future as the others give out 
11293 Quality and price are great. I wish the threads weren t so darn long though. I m just posting this so the MNF might consider shortening them? :D 
11294 This camera is awesome and you can t beat the price. The best thing that I like is that the screen on the camera is so very clear and easy to use...will have lots of fun with this for years to come 
11295 took a little while to get it to work. has been great since with no issues. 
11296 Really easy to install. And love that I can get real time on my phone. Just download app and set up account good to go. Love it 
11297 Very satisfied. 
11298 Its not good for my canon t3 after a couple of shots it tells me the communication between the lens in the body are not compatible I have to clean the connectors this lens is s***** 
11299 The product is very low quality. It is cheaply made and does not work properly at all. 
11300 This is an awesome scope. 
11301 Looks like it will do the trick. Fairly comfortable and constructed well. 
11302 A really good camera for point and shoot. Has an amazing zoom, shoots quickly, has some special filters and stuff 
11303 100 % recomendable 
11304 Great kit for anyone with a go pro ! 
11305 I love the pouch they came in, and they work really well! 
11306 happy about it 
11307 Good charger I use it as an extra works perfect 
11308 Works perfectly for our smaller waterproof camera and allows it to easily float in the pool rather than sink to the bottom. 
11309 good product. 
11310 Right angle plug much better than straight plug. 
11311 Awesome in every way-- I bought this for a trip to Yosemite in August--was the perfect lens for my GH4-- 
11312 Like many things somethings you can not buy cheap 
11313 What I am looking for is about 300/500 dollar range. 
11314 well made. good price. 
11315 Good 
11316 It was working now it keeps disconnecting. I dont know whats going on 
11317 Great camera, came with all cables and parts. very high quality. 
11318 This item does what it is designed for. It does feel flimsy and make you worried that your flash will fall but it holds up. It works. 
11319 Works as well as original, but a tiny bit thicker making it difficult to eject from camera. 
11320 Super fast shipping & fit my Nikon perfectly 
11321 Great protection. 
11322 Not ready for prime time. After countless hours with their support, we could not get it to work. Had no choice but to return it. 
11323 Suction works well! Tried it on my wind shield and my surf Board and held up pretty tight! 
11324 A solid kit for any sort of standard photography uses! I used it successfully in cleaning both my sensor and my lenses. It is a great deal and definitely something to look into. 
11325 This is a fantastic lens. I can t recommend it enough. 
11326 I had to return it. Bad flash & one of the batteries were also bad. It was after 30 days & Amazon would not accept my return!!! 
11327 Good courteous job, with full satisfaction. 
11328 The best starter Professional tripod you can find. I would recommend this tripod any one who wants to start off with a awesome tripod. if your worried if it s shakey it s totally not super sturddy and can put it anywhere 
11329 Its a nice product. Came in safe and secure package. Got that nice look. So far I like it. 
11330 Sibling used this on his backpacking trip to Japan. Camera came back! The clip is really sturdy, there is no fear of the camera falling off. Great product! 
11331 great. 
11332 Very nice 
11333 I have been Pelican fan for some time and have picked up 7 bags so far! The best case for camera lenses. 
11334 Good quality and price 
11335 One of the best DYI system available on the market. 
11336 Better than the GoPro battery 
11337 Great case! Great quality. Perfect for my needs. 
11338 good price 
11339 Really like this camera 
11340 Perfect! 
11341 Fun to use. Very versatile. Held Canon Rebel ESO T3i stable and level. Hooked to a tree limb. :) 
11342 perfect 
11343 Love it. Very good starter Go Pro. Will eventually upgrade but this one is great for starters 
11344 I probably would have paid another $10 for GoPro s frame mount with the quick release. However this works too except the CamKix frame mount got caught in the front faceplate and bent the corner of it! Good thing these are replaceable. 
11345 Great little filters for the cutest camera ever, 
11346 Great bag for video gadgets. Well made and good cushion. 
11347 Has worked great ever since I bought it 
11348 Works great!:) 
11349 Extremely usefull and recomended to protect the camera. Canon 70D fits perfectly. 
11350 very happy with purchase 
11351 Durable. Reliable. Well-made. Great value! 
11352 This is a very affordable remote. I would recommend taking out the battery when not in use. I have found the battery dead several times. After being stored for a short time. 
11353 Excellent product. 
11354 My 1st one [exactly the same] was stolen, so I liked it so much I got another one. I ll be more careful this time. 
11355 Bought this for my Husband while he was out to sea. He used it constantly in rough conditions and it held up amazing. He filmed awesome footage of aircraft and similar events and he said it was extremely easy to use. 
11356 This gadget proved to be very helpful and convenient! 
11357 confusing instruction and battery not charging. 
11358 Very easy to set up and use. I have gotten amazing footage thanks to it on my bike! 
11359 Good telephoto lens in well lit situations. 
11360 amazing 
11361 They are sturdy forceful clamps. I like them fine so far. 
11362 CAN NOT fit my D750 as the title described!!!!! Please change the item title and the description!!! 
11363 These have a tendency to unscrew as you use it. I m thinking about taking it off 
11364 It really protects the camera and is easy to use. It can be used with the kit zoom, the Panasonic 14mm, and the Panasonic 20mm. The front cover doesn t fit when the Olympus 25mm is used, but you can still half cover that fits on the camera. 
11365 Exactly what I expected for the money. I wish the bars could be a little shorter, though. Too long with three bars, too short with two. Oh well, the price was right. 
11366 These are great! And the case to carry them in is perfect! 
11367 The camera is fine. 
11368 The NVR is dead after 7 months. Front panel light are dark. Also ... The cameras require Microsoft Windows to configure. Cannot access without an unsecure and unsigned Active-x IE plugin. This system is useless to users with real computers. Linux users beware. 
11369 Works great! Must buy for any photographer, amateur or pro. 
11370 just the item i need. 
11371 This bulb is really big. But it does put out a very nice and bright light. I m using it to light a painting area. Would not recommend using this for regular lamps due to size. 
11372 This is a really good value. You get a ton of paper for a very small price. 
11373 Not working with Control4... 
11374 Didn t work well broke, but I got what I paid for 
11375 Awesome camera!!!! Lots of features that I will need to learn how of use..Uploading to internet is a breezy!!! 
11376 This item is exactly what I have been looking for. My SLR is very heavy and I have been looking for some way to distribute the weight. 
11377 Have everything I need for my sj4000 adventures ;) 
11378 PIXDIGITAL is not an approved NIKON dealer (called 3rd Party by NIKON). Subsequently NIKON will not honor their warranty on the camera. 
11379 It is well worth getting these chargers when you add the battery pack to your camera. 
11380 Works great, lightweight and nicely straps to wrist when your up a ladder! 
11381 Works. Fast shipping. Easy setup. Great picture. 
11382 This is a great wifi camera, very easy setup 
11383 We use it everyday to keep an eye on our dogs. 
11384 100% good 
11385 Did not work well with android note 3 
11386 I love the light from this. I can t use it because on the two location shoots I ve brought it out, half of the support ribs have broken. 
11387 I used i this on my panasonic ag-ac 90, It works excellent. No humming or background noise like other mics in the price range. 
11388 It fits snug on my flash and does a great job of changing the light of the flash. 
11389 I feel like this product is a little half-baked, they rushed it to market and it isn t great. The shogun is great, but I m considering finding a third-party sun-hood. 
11390 Good price on these batteries, and they arrived before I expected them to. 
11391 seems to be doing a great job as of yet! smudging is a bit temperamental when it happens.. but I wipe it with a lens cloth and it seems to do the trick 
11392 Great product for the price. Shipping was fast. The battery life only lasted about an hour, but for price I was still happy with the product. 
11393 It works great on portraits. I recommend this also to my friends. 
11394 I ordered this thinking that it was a wireless, returned it without a hassle when I got it. 
11395 Great camera 
11396 So bad it s not worth a review.. useless junk. 
11397 A convenient little bag to hold my t3i camera and its lens. It s just what I needed. However, if you wanted to carry extra lenses, this would not be a good bag for you. 
11398 Sony is very good 
11399 The easiest waist of money, doesn t work AT ALL. 
11400 good price and product. 
11401 Thanks 
11402 Works as described and reasonably priced. 
11403 Just what I needed, great price and fast shipping 
11404 Loved these! Eventually the clamp tips did snap or break off so not sure if that s normal wear and tear or if I did something that caused it. Just used it to clamp fabric onto my photography backdrop stand. 
11405 Great value for the price, my son love it because of unbelievable quality. 
11406 so far so good 
11407 not always focused, not enough zoom for me 
11408 This works if you bounce it off the ceiling 
11409 Fast delivery, good product 
11410 Same color as described. Lovely grass green Great thick quality as usual 
11411 works great 
11412 I m a 10 year old girl and got this camera from my grandparents. I like the camera because I can go underwater with it, and I can take selfies, and I like the color choices. 
11413 The camera software is not compatible with my smartphone ... no version available for other cell phones or tablets 
11414 Haven t used it yet but it is charging 
11415 Awesome product and for the price? Da boooomb! I love it. The shots are smooth and I look like a pro. Awesome. 
11416 NIce lens hood, looks well made, gets the job done. 
11417 It seem good for the price, i will use it and update the review. 
11418 Really clear sound for the cheap price. Sucks the cord is short so can t do long distance stuff, and the wind shield fell off super easily so it s lost forever. 
11419 Works well, stays on glass and holds up my point and shoot, no complaints here! 
11420 The lense bends the horizon on the peripherals, the software will not load on my iPad. The system seems to be incompatible with my 64bit windows app. There were no prohibitive warnings at the time of purchase. Kind of a rip off, Nothing works as expected. 
11421 Shutter button would have been nice... 
11422 Clever system that works for us. Not intended as a full time security system but more peace of mind when away. Could do with some sort of IFTTT integration or one of the smart home systems - maybe on the way if so then systems get even better. 
11423 A 
11424 AAAAA+++++ 
11425 I use it as babay monitor and it works very well, I can see the stutas everywhere. recommened. 
11426 Amazing camera! My daughter loves it! 
11427 The lenz arrived on time and works great 
11428 Love this case! Looks great and fits my Samsung WB35F smart camera great! Just a little snug at first but stretches just enough to fit perfectly! 
11429 Love this tripod. Definitely sturdy. 
11430 I was a little nervous about buying a refurbished camera, but I have not had any issues with it and it takes beautiful pics. 
11431 very nice and slim 
11432 New and delivered on time. Great deal. 
11433 Would not recommend 
11434 Great image quality, fast lens at low cost. Plastic mount is durable. No focus scale and lens hood. I would get the FA 50 1.4 if I was more professional. Great lens for cost conscious enthusiast without sacrificing image quality. 
11435 Delivery was on timeach and the charger has a great overall value. 
11436 Very nice product, doesn t have the quality feel that more expensive ones have, but performs great nonetheless. Only problems I had was the battery door not staying shut occasionally, and the foot being plastic, I broke it while removing it from the camera. 
11437 Camera works very well. It does generate quite a bit of heat, but the image is very nice. 
11438 Excellent camera, good quality and clear image. 
11439 Muy buenos 
11440 it came with a bag, camera strap and 32 gb memory card. Thanks 
11441 Great product, used it for 2 years in our office. No falsies, no problems. Calls up to 3 phone numbers when activated. Perfect for small businesses located in a big building without security. Door opening and motion activated, strongly recommend. Not for high security. 
11442 the batteries and charger worked as expected, the items were delivered as promised on time with no issues. A seamless transaction as it should be. 
11443 I have had no issues with this. Fits my Canon 70D with a longer lens on it. Great for everyday use. 
11444 Easy to operate. Slides sometimes hang up inside. Otherwise - light is bright, picture is good. Did not try negatives. 
11445 When used with various Lowepro bags and their utility belt, this is a great way to distribute weight and reduce the strain on my shoulders (already an issue with two Nikon DSLRs). 
11446 This was for a Granddaughter, so I don t know about the performance. I did get it in just a couple of days, so I was very happy about that. 
11447 As advertised. Solid construction and fits perfectly on my 400 Rebel XTi. The ability to use either standard batteries or 2 battery packs make this quite versatile. I ve used it with the battery packs and it lasts a long time. I recommend this product. 
11448 I have been using this camera for a few weeks now, and I have been completely with its performance. Expecially when you get into it more advanced features like the multi frame noise reduction and HDR. my wife loves the creativity while in auto mode 
11449 Good for the price. Really creates the appearance of a TV 
11450 Awesome product great the building custom iPhone rigs 
11451 Excellent 
11452 Cant beat the price fast charge and always have a battery for my canon D30 camera 
11453 Exactly what I wanted for my T5i...snug fit with kit lens. Will offer the protection I was looking for. Snug around body and long enough to cover lens plus straps secure to each other. 
11454 sharp, rich colors on my 7R2 
11455 Fantastic for the price! Great accessory for macro lighting! 
11456 Love this camera. With the bundle you have everything you need. 
11457 Great product very good prise fast shipment I recommend. 
11458 Perfect. Flexible and lightweight. 
11459 I got it, what more do you want. 
11460 Lens is great. I am highly satisfied! 
11461 Great 200 ISO color negative film. Seem to shoot a little blue for me, I have been editing this during scanning. 
11462 I like it. 
11463 Product works as advertised. However, like other reviewers have said, it is very hard to remove the lens. I have resorted to using a flat blade screwdriver to get in there to unlock the pin so I can remove the lens from the adapter. 
11464 Works great, just what i needed. Great distance, worked well out of range while camping even. 
11465 Take the time to balance and it works great. The grip tries to slide though. 
11466 Not much to say. I m happy with this product. 
11467 Excellent binoculars. I can see far goes perfectly with this product that is not too expensive. I am satisfied 
11468 Product is light weight and feels durable. Metal GoPro attachment point is a big plus for confidence that your GoPro is staying put. GREAT customer service! 
11469 Easy to use. Well worth the price 
11470 stopped working after a week 
11471 Do not buy this camera as a deterrent, it is only meant to fill in spots that real cameras might miss. If this is the only camera, in about a week everyone will know it is fake. 
11472 Ok 
11473 Bright back light, Clear view in bright and sunny conditions outdoors. Long action time on high capacity battery (2 days of use between charges.). Only came with short MiniHDMI to HDMI patch cable and no pigtail for the analog av input. Would have also liked a 12vDC pigtail as well. 
11474 Just what I was looking for 
11475 Works as intended. 
11476 good camara but didn t realise that it didn t have share options 
11477 It is just the size (a medium, despite the description) for my needs, falling between a couple of smaller bags and a larger system bag. It certainly seems sturdy and well designed. I opted for the orange interior to make finding the small odds and ends easier. 
11478 Pain to install and uninstall. Does not fit in case with guards on... 
11479 Takes great pictures! 
11480 ok;-))) 
11481 Love it! 
11482 I love my Manfrotto! 
11483 It came exactly as the description said it would. It s adorable and unique. 
11484 Bought one of these for my 70D and it works great. But no surprise there - I have bought SterlingTek batteries for my other DSLRs (40D & G12) and they have always been excellent and cost-effective. Highly recommended! 
11485 This is not a UNIVERSAL AC ADAPTOR, it does not fit into my device 
11486 This little camera works awesome for a whole bunch of different applications from underwater to live shows and for the price you can t really find something this good I think. 
11487 Fit my filters fine. A nice additional to my Cannon SX520 outfit. Well worth the price. 
11488 The frame works great and has a great picture. The directions for use after set up could be better but, even I figured out how to navigate the web site. 
11489 Great mic, low hiss 
11490 Happy 
11491 Received on time and in perfect condition. Works very well with no issues. Recommended product 
11492 Worked as advertised. Expensive way to print out pics. 
11493 This is a very simple device and so far it has worked as advertised. The item is supposed to be built by Foto&Teck but it carries the name &#34;Lynca&#34;. It works and it is very inexpensive. 
11494 These work great! 
11495 I bought this initially for my binoculars to use at concerts but took it to Boston last weekend and paired it up with my camera and it was great. It s light, compact, and steadies your shots beautifully. 
11496 High quality and worked fantastic! 
11497 All seems in order. I got this to view the Blood Moon in September 2015. And to view our wonderful night sky on other occasions. Packs easily in the backpack (included). Nice value. 
11498 Extremely light and EXTREMELY loud. You pull the top loop off the Robocopp to turn it on, and it s very secure so you can be sure it won t go off automatically. It s sturdy, well-designed, and as I said, it s LOUD!! 
11499 Ok 
11500 Awesome build quality and functionality! gonna buy more for my class. 
11501 excellent 
11502 it is very well 
11503 Awesome camera! Plenty of features, easy to handle, and takes absolutely splendid pictures! 
11504 They do the job of an extension tube, but feel very cheap. My lenses have also become stuck every now and then, but still easy to remove. 
11505 Great siren. Has decent volume 
11506 Great Product 
11507 Battery was great. Last double of the one that came with it. 
11508 Great tripod, very light weight but sturdy. I can now get close-ups without movement by using the bluetooth remote control button. 
11509 Great product. and it s a Tiffen even better. 
11510 Good quality...good price...timely shipping. 
11511 Works! but probably would not withstand rough handling. JC 
11512 Fits my old camera perfectly thanks ^^ 
11513 What can I say, it works......got tired of fooling with this and just put velcro on the speed light..... 
11514 Good price 
11515 Great Product 
11516 works great. 
11517 The batteries are working well so far. I don t live them overnight for charging. They will get hot if you do. The charger is fine too. But you should charge one battery at a time. 
11518 So far so good. Arrived earlier than promised. Have used a few times with excellent results. This was purchased for a Canon 60D. 
11519 There is a reason why products like this from Manfrotto are more expensive.... They are grade A quality and you can tell. The movement of this head and the incredibly sleek build are perfect for video and/or photo. You get what you pay for! 
11520 The best lens I d owned so far. 
11521 Very good, but it doesn t quite have the range of configuration I was hoping for. I could probably use on with slightly longer arms. Mechanically, it is solid. 
11522 Great product, as expected!! 
11523 Worked very well. It attached to my Canon t2i and helped me take some great pictures. 
11524 Perfect. 
11525 Equal, in my opinion, to high-priced brand name filter sets. 
11526 Works perfectly on my Canon T3i and 7D Mark II 
11527 These cells actually had more juice then my OEM battery. Highly recommend this product. 
11528 Got the wrong size case but it works good for something else I am using it for 
11529 It is very good 
11530 Great product! Easy to position. Stays wear you put it. 
11531 I like it 
11532 very good ! 
11533 Very happy with them!! 
11534 works just fine 
11535 Product met all my expectations, price competitive and delivery quick. What else can one add? 
11536 A++++++ 
11537 so far great lens, very low light pic looks good shooting with nikon d7100 iso250 f2.8 new camera and lens my bluecloud. 
11538 The product was delivered in a timely manner. It was purchased for a new Canon 70D DSLR. It fits well, but it is a bit loose. It falls off in my camera bag, as I m removing the camera. While using the camera there is no problem. 
11539 Very clear, bright image with accurate color. Weight is not too great for easy carrying considering the magnification and objective lens diameter. Lens caps are awkward in use. 
11540 small enough to put in my back pack but not big enough to carry everything you want in it 
11541 need to include attachment instructions 
11542 Hi, it came in a bundle. Big, spacious, but the twinkle that makes when you walk is just too annoying. 
11543 it s comfortable for the dogs, put on snug it holds up very well to even my most active dog. Running jumping swimming! Keeps position and gives a great view!!!! 
11544 works great 
11545 There are much more effective staff on the market. But I found how and where to apply it. Good for the price. 
11546 This is a nice protective cover for the price. It fits my Canon SX40 nicely and fits in your pocket when not in use. 
11547 Works well! 
11548 product was as advertised. shipment was quick. 
11549 The gaps (in the way the cover closes) reflect on all of the photos. 
11550 fits the 18-55mm lens perfectly. 
11551 Great but needed assistance to setup 
11552 Indiana Jones asked me where I got this and how much it cost. He offered to exchange this for his leather pouch; but, I didn t accept the trade. 
11553 Product was as advertised and a great buy for the price, shipping was on time and the tripod works with a number of different cameras. A worthwhile purchase 
11554 Good deal for the price. Has every piece needed to enjoy the camera. 
11555 My purpose for this camera was to watch my dog. I love it. I can also talk to him which is awesome. To be able to scan the room Is a great feature. Highly recommend this product. 
11556 plenty of run time with this pack 
11557 Great light as a great price 
11558 cannot connect as wireless unit have done everything - useless 
11559 Easy to program. 
11560 Everything was as stated. All accessories were as described. Arrived on time. Product is excellent 
11561 light & durable, we will see how it lasts the test of time. 
11562 These are great! You can place them on windows or doors and they will chime or sound an alarm when one is opened. Definitely beats paying a high price for alarm monitoring. 
11563 I just needed somethin to see my driveway area. Easy to hook up and works great 
11564 I got this camera since a friend of mine has it and I saw it working. It works for me as a baby monitor. I had no issues installing and setting up it. Like it! 
11565 Charger does a fine job and fits the battery well. 
11566 A few times after using my GoPro with this case for a while in the water, the lens on the case begins to fog up a bit. From time to time I have to disassemble the case in order to wipe the inside which becomes a bit inconvenient. 
11567 Very happy with the batteries, charger and all at half the price. Great deal! I was so happy that it arrived early so I could take it with me on vacation! 
11568 Worked Better than expected !! 
11569 Is a great tool for beginners as well as pros, and takes amazing shots! Lightweight and high quality! 
11570 Nice 
11571 easy to operate. Husband has a very large wrist fits him perfect 
11572 This battery works very well with my external HD dsiplay monitor used for my camcorder. Battery discharge lasted for the time expected. Recharge time depends on the charger, but I had no issues iwth this item. 
11573 excellent product 
11574 Too many parts not as easy to install as expected 
11575 great camera and cheap 
11576 Purchased this item to replace a broken contact on sliding glass door. Item arrived quickly, was exactly as represented in the description, was easy to install. 
11577 This camera is my baby, I highly recommend it to anyone who loves photography. Plus you can t beat a touch screen display ! 
11578 i like it. great ! 
11579 PERFECT!!!! Works great! Sooo easy. We have the GoPro4 mounted on our roll cage of our RZR... I put this remote on my wrist and control it from my seat. 
11580 sometimes the control of the lens through this extension not work but still good addition to my gear. 
11581 My son really liked the camera and it looks to have a good seal. Should come with some small memory stick. 
11582 This was more of a pain to use than it was worth. The clips don t allow for for flexible positioning. We had to use our clamps instead. More for studio use than field use. 
11583 work good no problems yet 
11584 Just what I wanted. 
11585 It s a battery. It works. 
11586 These work very well for getting a better position on the camera. Along with a set of straights, there are only a few positions that are not possible. 
11587 Simple and durable. 
11588 Only used couple of times but works good 
11589 It is just perfect! 
11590 Great filter. Now I can shoot video in sunny condition with low aperture and fixed shutter speed. Good deal! 
11591 As Described 
11592 Definitely a little too expensive for what it gives you but it does perform well. 
11593 Great value, good quality kit, seems solid. 
11594 higher quality 
11595 Perfect size case for all my gear. Make sure to get the lid organizer too. 
11596 Have a wide range of lenses for my Lumix DMC-GM5...but this lens has quickly become my absolute favorite... 
11597 The camera was clean and has performed great shooting sports for two weeks. 
11598 Rounded ones fit well on the top of my 8hp Johnson motor. I also used one on the dashboard of my jeep. Also worked perfect. 
11599 Best bang for the buck in a 4K camera, I m very impressed with the resolution and capabilities, I d been discovered its potential day by day. 
11600 The charger works perfectly with my original battery and getting the extra pair of batteries means I can shoot for days before needing to recharge. 
11601 Works great and easy to program. 
11602 I bought this device from this seller based on the reviews. The device is not the one pictured, but is identical to the cheapest looking, lower rated models. Don t make the mistake I made. Don t pay extra for looks and reviews. 
11603 Nice and compact case! And WOW for customer service! They wanted to make sure I was happy with the product and followed up with me immediately on a question I had. 
11604 Husband LOVES it! 
11605 Works as they say. Easy to install easy to use. 
11606 Product works great. Got it the next day! 
11607 fits perfect, but it should, both case and camera are Sony 
11608 Wife likes it in her buisness. Mail n more. Thinking of buying another one for the new restaurant. 
11609 Very nice just what I wanted. It did not disappoint. Durable and beautiful for photos 
11610 Good camera! Good delivery 
11611 Other reviews state that the rolls don t have an expiration date but I used it for the Dallas Cowboys training camp, the pictures are great. Product arrived before specified date. 
11612 Camera is one of the best of this type on the market. Quick setup and excellent support if needed. Just call Walter and he can provide you with excellent help & support 
11613 Excellent hi resolution video surveillance camera, can be controlled remotely so it can pan and zoom remotely provides good color video when there is enough light and monochrome video using infrared in the dark. 
11614 Best buy for the money! 
11615 great 
11616 Fits perfectly on my Canon 18-135 STM lens. I can zoom wide and it s not in the picture. It also doesn t stop me from being able to put the lens cap on when I m done with the camera. It s everything I needed for this lens. 
11617 The batteries doesn t hold the charge as well as the actual fujifilm battery I have. I noticed if I don t use the batteries after charging them, they slowly lose charge. So they are not amazing, but work as expected. 
11618 It worked great until the attenna broke off. It is touchy, will try again and be more careful. Otherwise it worked as it is supposed to. 
11619 The colors are not as vivid as I would like, but far superior to my last photo frame. I have not a explored all its capabilities, but it appears it will do more than I will ever use. It is a good value and well worth its price. 
11620 Not great but works 
11621 For the money, this is a nice quality case. Bought it for a Phantom 3. The hell fits great. Had to do a few small cuts for the controller. But it was easy with an electric kitchen knife. Not as sturdy as a hard case, but good basic protection. 
11622 very good 
11623 good 
11624 Worked perfectly 
11625 So happy I can find instant film at a low price! 
11626 Danny was very helpful with the problems I was having setting up my camera. The camera is very clear 
11627 Everything Perfect! 
11628 Incredibly solid, microscopic precision machining and tolerances, and superb build quality! A real winner! 
11629 excellent 
11630 Great WiFi camera for the price...easy to set up 
11631 at my second month it broke 
11632 nice product 
11633 as good as a go pro kess expensive 
11634 Got to use it once, then strapped on the chesty mount to paddle board and the gopro popped out and sank to the bottom of the Willamette River during Redbull Flugtag in Portland. Should have just been using this. Oops 
11635 Light and cute camera! Comes with a lot of accessories. Video/photo is sharp and clear. Also the price is so much better than GoPro. 
11636 Very good quality and very light. 
11637 Excellent monopod. It comes with a phone holder and it is also good for camera. Most importantly, it locks, which allows to install a phone or a camera without any fears. It looks sturdy, I hope it will last. It comes with phone holder and a screw for Gopro. 
11638 Pretty small, but does work. 
11639 Excelllent Product and great price 
11640 Excellent! Exactly what I was expecting. 
11641 Henry Campbell was very helpful in solving my camera issues. Henry was very diligent in making sure my issues were resolved. Foscam has excellent products. I recently bought 2 more Foscam wireless cameras. 
11642 These work pretty well and last a reasonable length of time (without using the flash, though I ve read LION AA batteries last longer.) Having 2 batteries means you always have a spare ready to go if 1 batteries gives out. And it was a good deal. 
11643 I have a camera like this, love it. Got this one for a friend. 
11644 Great product 
11645 It blew..... amazon gave me a refund, also I would have given it 0 stars if I could 
11646 perfect fit for my eos t3i as good as new piece 
11647 Use this on my Canon T3 and T5i; works fantastic. Fast lens for a low price. 
11648 This item arrived in good condition. It will come in handy when I need to clean my camera and looks like a quality item. I received this item at a discount for my honest opinion. 
11649 Good items! 
11650 Super product! 
11651 Very heavy duty and will protect my camera gear without any worries. 
11652 good 
11653 Takes a bit of patience to dial in motion sensitivity so that it doesn t record anything that moves. Make sure to schedule reboot at least once per week. Dlink app is ok. Saving recordings to network drive performs better than to sandisk. 
11654 great batteries and prompt shipping. 
11655 Don t pay for the name brand. This an amazing product. All in the family have loved using it. Riding water crafts, swimming with dolphins and surfing it is uP to the task. 
11656 Product was as described, and delivered as scheduled.The quality is excellent and does the job perfectly. 
11657 We have a great picture. Very pleased. 
11658 Worst video security camera I have ever used. 
11659 Good Boom stand for the price..will do the job if you don t want to break the bank. Received this boom stand pretty fast. So far it has been very sturdy and I ve had no problems whatsoever. 
11660 perfect no problem what so over. 
11661 My Nordic waterproof camera floats work as expected. They are keeping my valuable cameras safe in, and around the water. 
11662 Great Update 
11663 I ve long wanted the SLR-Zoom GorillaPod and when it went on sale I couldn t pass up on it. I use it for my Samsung NX1 and 16-50mm S lens - it works as intended and don t have to worry about hitting the weight limit! 
11664 It s a great tripod for beginners who haven t used one before. I noticed that when I tried to adjust it some washers and bolts actually fell off of it. But besides that, it works great. 
11665 Works great on glass. Customer Service was excellent and I was contacted by the owner to ensure everything was satisfactory. Where else can you find customer service this good. Will definitely buy from a service that cares for their customers. 
11666 I might have to return it Didn t come with manuel on how to use Fits my camera but when I take a picture it comes up errow try cleaning lenses 
11667 I needed something compact for spare lenses. These are perfect. I love the cinch cord with hooks so I can clip them to other items or my bag. The padding offers extra cushion to protect the lens. Great value. 
11668 Awesome quad copter!! My sone LOVES it!!! 
11669 This greatly exceeded my expectations. It s easy to setup and is nicely made, considering its very modest price. Now I only need to pull out the big roll of seamless paper for large items. This is perfect for items up to about to about the size of a basketball. 
11670 Holds all my gear safely. Lots of room for stuff. 
11671 Great little camera. The only potential problem are the on and off switch, gets stuck from time to time. 
11672 Great value 
11673 Too complicated. 
11674 Great product and great price. I would purchase again. Best Buy didn t carry the batteries, but they sold the camera that needed them. Go figure. 
11675 ok 
11676 These batteries may not last as long as the Canon ones, but they have lasted me for three years and still kicking! 
11677 works ok but to small and to heavy 
11678 It was the item I ordered and perfect for transferring pics. 
11679 Love, Love, Love this! I will order another one just to have for events. Using this one for my photo booth at my party and the second one will be used just for a second prop to have a different background for pictures. Very professional looking. 
11680 Good for quick carry, doesn t take all your lenses and accessories. 
11681 Still holds up well. I needed something to protect my camera. I love this cover. 
11682 Good 
11683 Worked great 
11684 Don t waste your money! 
11685 I bought a Nikon camera and this cable wasn t included. Anyway I thought I needed it and this cable worked perfectly 
11686 Love the product, like how it attaches to my camera very easily and quickly while trying them out.. it would be nice if they make included a red and orange color one too, maybe in the future they will.. 
11687 These are great octoboxes for the price. I can t speak to their durability as I only use them indoor in a studio, but for my purposes they work great! 
11688 Got it for Zukio 12-40mm f/2.8 Pro 
11689 Perfect for the mobius does feel a bit make shift but works exactly as it should. 
11690 Securing your property have never been easier while at the same time being able to be done with such quality as it is now possible with EasyN IP camera,High quality video makes me happily to monitor my store.I will buy more. 
11691 Fits great, works great. Does exactly what it s supposed to do ... 
11692 great service and price 
11693 The best drone for professional and safe pilots who respect the art. 
11694 My grandson loves them. 
11695 Cute and works well to keep the camera afloat! 
11696 camera would not work with my iphone ,appel 5s. The app kept dropping info and I had to re enter. 
11697 Board snapped 1st day on set. Gaff tape kept it together mostly. Rain started to wash colors off the sticks 
11698 Great price and great product. Can be used to charge Wasabi and GoPro battery. Gives a lot of flexibility. 
11699 To those who say it will not fit the SX520 - they are right. It does not even come close. It does appear to be a classy case, somewhat retro which I like. Too bad it does not fit the SX520. 
11700 its ok but now with more gear the bag is to small need bigger one 
11701 its great and the color match the camera, 
11702 Works perfectly 
11703 I Love This Film 
11704 Good 
11705 worst product ever, no instuctions sent it back for full refund...still cost me $300.00 to find out it would not work 
11706 I also sent message to amazon to let them know 
11707 The filter holder is padded and, protects the unused filters. I consider this to be a very nice value for the money. 
11708 An inexpensive way to adjust the flash on the a6000. Works well. 
11709 It is a good semi professional camera. The only problem is sometimes gets hard to get focus. 
11710 grainy video 
11711 Very flimsy album and will not order it again 
11712 This is an amzing tripod. Especially for the price. It has everything you need. I just don t recommend taking it outside if its windy but besides that it s wonderful. You should really buy this 
11713 I love my Nikon Coolpix. It takes great photos in low light and has a powerful zoom. I only wish it were smaller and lighter, but you can t have it all. 
11714 I can say nothing bad about this camera, was so usefull for my photography class, and even after the class i ve still been using it! Great deal over all 10/10! 
11715 Would not take the information for the protection. How can you register your product if the website will not take the information. NOT GOOD! I feel like SmartGuard took my money - no coverage of product. 
11716 Great picture quality without that &#34;fish-eye&#34; look, night vision works well ( unless pay higher $ for infrared cams ) No problem with cables and power adaptor. 
11717 I really enjoyed it. It works as expected. However, it kind of sucks that it only takes 8 pictures, especially with it being so expensive. 
11718 Rather than digging up the wire when I moved the PTZ camera I purchased a replacement cable. Good quality, works as it should. 
11719 The shipping was really fast but the product came damaged so I wasn t able to take it on my vacation as planned. Not sure if it happened during shipping or what 
11720 Leather? No it is not. But, not too bad 
11721 Poor performance out of box. Need to be collimated. Celestron may charge you extra to do it. Once collimated, works fine. 
11722 Fit perfectly and does it s job well. I m a happy customer.(: 
11723 These cases are very nice, plenty of room for the gear and it rolls well. Two man carry handles work great. 
11724 Lots of really cool things in here. Some of the items I had no idea what they were for. When I googled them I got inspired with cool new things to try with my GoPro 
11725 Can t get it to work.went step by step.records nothing 
11726 This is a really nice &#34;bundle&#34; I gave it as a gift and thought it was a good camera with some good accessories. 
11727 My daughter received it OK. However, I apparently ordered the wrong one because it didn t charge her camera. Thanks 
11728 a perfect replacement for the original Eyepiece cup that comes on the camera. 
11729 Good product. 
11730 The device refuses to recognize the internal hard drive. Cameras work, but the system will not record. 
11731 Far smaller than appears in photo 
11732 So far so good. 
11733 Great addition to the Tilta rig. Allows you to move the handles down and forward to, with the addition of a shoulder pad, create a shoulder rig for the BMCC. Amazon price was way better than eBay or direct from Tilta. 
11734 awesome!!! use it all the time!!!!! great price 
11735 Be careful with using them in flashlights they will blow bulbs in streamlight TL-2 and TL- 3 my mistake 
11736 but great lights 
11737 Camera, case and extra battery are great. The other stuff is just clutter 
11738 Love all of the compartments and construction of this bag. My Cannon t3i fits perfect! 
11739 as described. 
11740 Works as well as expected. Better for trip to Greece to take Acropolis photos in crowds. Light-weight & packable for carry on luggage for airplane, no questions asked (I thought it might not pass because could be used as a weapon). 
11741 One side where the flash is inserted just broke. Made of cheap material. 
11742 Great camera for the price.... Excellent customer service from Digital1 
11743 Quite satisfied with it. Do wish it had a GPS. 
11744 The further zoom the more blurry. 
11745 Order it and got it pretty quick. The item is working just fine. Came about half charge on one and the other was full charged. Thanks 
11746 Great product 
11747 The spectacle of this tiny camera is big, when you consider its tiny size. I bought the camera for its large 20.1 sensor, but mainly because it boasted a premium Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar lens. The results are unmistakenly grand. 
11748 Worked very well for charging my camera battery! 
11749 tks 
11750 Works well with my A7. 
11751 Love 
11752 Roy martin help was so appreciated thank you foscam!!! 
11753 Great Product. How do you get value any batter than this with Prime shipping?! 
11754 Works pretty well. Sometimes difficult to keep it out of the picture. 
11755 The description item says &#34;Waterproof&#34; and I have used just one time in my pool and later, the screws show corrosion. 
11756 Complete package of accessories for lower than individual prices. 
11757 Easy setup, superior design, and superb definition. 
11758 Camera sucked in lighting setting weren t helpful. Pictures came out light. Better to buy in store. 
11759 Cable arrived ahead of schedule and worked as expected. Good service, good value. 
11760 super dooper 
11761 great 
11762 This works great, first tried a bar fly which was no good. Arkon actually fits the bars of a bicycle handle 
11763 It floats and it s easily visible. Solid product especially for the price. Saved me the first time I used it, almost lost my camera as i was floating down the Potomac river. 
11764 perfecto 
11765 like it..! 
11766 Good quality tape. 
11767 I really love this product. It s all about whatever I was looking for. It s so convenient. I am fully satisfied. 
11768 Works great, and shipping was quick! 
11769 They gave me the purchase price for what I paid for since they couldn t fix my camera and were very nice helpful and quick 
11770 soooo happy with my purchase! the shipping was super fast and came a day early. :) I am so excited to use it! 
11771 Exactly what we expected. 
11772 Both the battery and charger have worked well so far, and that too, at a price that is hard to beat! 
11773 Works great! 
11774 I love my Canary. Not only does it help me keep an eye on the house, but I can also watch the kids playing in the other room! 
11775 They work great, good investment! 
11776 The pictures are clear and pretty low maintenance for the price. The night view could be better, and the mounting brackets are cheap, they never stay in place and requires frequent adjustments. Anyway, over all a good buy for the price. 
11777 It broke the first day i got it the foot crumbled now can t be used. Didn t even get to try it out very disappointing 
11778 Great hidden camera, no one even can notice it s recording. Directions are confusing, but after you buy it, the seller sends clear instructions. Wish it was 1080p too. 
11779 Used for transporting firearm on vacation 
11780 Ordering more. 
11781 No problems, 
11782 Crappy accessories. 
11783 Love this camera....very easy to set up and use. The picture/video is clear even in low light. I like having the ability to keep an eye on what s going on at home when I m not there. The motion sensor and text alert are also great. 
11784 Love this so much!!! Beyond my expectations and it s worthy for me to wait so loong time to have it :) 
11785 ok 
11786 Have been using this camera both on dry land and underwater. I think the auto-focus is not quite as good as the old Canon that I replaced but, otherwise, this is a nice camera for someone who just wants to &#34;point and shoot.&#34; 
11787 Amazing Value for the money. Recommend buying extra batteries, there is a set of 4 or 5 that can be charged at the same time. That is what I bought and it is perfect. about 45 minutes total fly time. 
11788 Good idea for waterproof cameras, but no way to adjust for wrist/hand size. Well made 
11789 The caps is a great help when transporting water. 
11790 Thank you :) 
11791 Superb product for a great price. Lightweight and compact. 
11792 Not as good a picture as the Fujikam it replaced, but all of the local services it provides (to e-mail, local recording, FTP upload) make it worth it. The web interface is also well laid out and easy to use. Presets are pretty cool to play around with. 
11793 Love this thing! I bought this for my wife for Mother s Day and had no problem setting it up. It s completely easy to use. Really cool digital photo frame. 
11794 The best I have used 
11795 No complaints!! 
11796 The blower was the only item that completely matched the description. Biggest letdown was receiving a cheap brush pen instead of a Lens Pen. 
11797 Very happy with the camera system, I can rest better knowing I can watch the activity around the house at night, 
11798 Great clarity. Traveled abroad and monitored thr cameras with no problems. Make sure you have a good internet connection and you re golden. Customer support was very responsive to my questions before receiving and after. Highly recommended. 
11799 OK 
11800 awesome! 
11801 It didn t come with all of the pieces to cover all the sides. 
11802 Excellent work perfectly! 
11803 Shipped quickly, works perfect for the Nikon camera I am using for. 
11804 Does what it says 
11805 Didn t work for what I intended to use it for. Tried to mount my camera on my windshield but my camera would just be facing at awkward angles. Very strong suction though. 
11806 I would have given it 5 stars but you cannot view your photos with this on, otherwise it works as advertied 
11807 Better than expected 
11808 It s a good camera for what I need it for. The tripod is stupid... seriously, there s no other description for it. 
11809 It looks nice, and I like the pattern. 
11810 These are light and move very smoothly and with great ease. It was a great purchase. I bought a second one here at Amazon after this first one arrived. Make sure you have the right width based on your tripod. 
11811 Works perfect for my cameral!!! 
11812 Sometimes when one gets stuck it ruins the whole case and you can no longer use the rest of the packaged polaroid 
11813 Great price, works well. Worked like a OE flash. Will by another for a slave unit. 
11814 Not as thick as I expected. 
11815 This was cheaply made and tightening each leg as i lengthened it was a night mare. Didn t stay tight. The legs became loose and one of them broke. This was all within a month of getting it with minimal use. 
11816 [[VIDEOID:153357149d2c408819cc54ff2a1c437a]] Camera take great videos. Came with lots of accessories. Waterproof case works great. Great camera for the price.

11817 Great picture & Super wide image. Onvif works. Using 2 of them with BlueIris. 
11818 Second time buying this product.. no issues, works great for our chicken coops! 
11819 FAST DELIVERY...PERFECT FABRIC...LIGHTWEIGHT YET DOES HOLD ITS SHAPE VERY WELL.... 5 STARS TO THE COMPANY....COWBOY STUDIO 
11820 Just as expected 
11821 I have a Lopro that s a little bigger and takes up to much space. This smaller version fits the bill when I m packing lighter. Good value 
11822 Better than buying more filters. 
11823 same as before 
11824 all fine 
11825 Great case for the money. 
11826 The camera is very easy to use and is small enough to fit in your pocket or purse. Takes good pictures. 
11827 When this camera works, it s fantastic. I purchased it to take photos of the animals in our local animal shelter. The Sports mode and burst functions work very well for this application. The problem is that the camera is unreliable. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn t. 
11828 Have not had to use alarm, but like knowing that it is here if I do need it. I tested alarm, and it worked. 
11829 Good deal and very good lights. 
11830 the battery s and the charger work great. 
11831 Very easy to setup. The cameras have decent low light resolution but in color and with light sometimes are blurry. The motion detection is very sensitive, picking up even slight movements. Overall and for them money, this is a very good product. 
11832 It s awesome lots of pockets, and useful cutouts. It doesn t hold a P3 controller perfect, but I made do. 
11833 Good camera for the price! 
11834 Used this for snorkeling and scuba in south florida. Evens out the color just perfectly!! 
11835 I like 5x7 format for my photos.... the problem is there are no small photo albums. This one does nicely...... 
11836 they work good.Just what I needed. Was about to chunk the camera but they fixed it. 
11837 great conversion piece with fellow shooter. Works well and just not on camera and lens. 
11838 Excelente 
11839 Perfect!!!! Great batteries on arrived early!! 
11840 This is perfect for what I do. Needed for release on landscape pics that required long shutter speeds. 
11841 Perfect 
11842 The Removu P1 is a lifesaver when it comes to framing shots while boating. Until now, it was a guessing game to make sure I had the shot I wanted, but now I can make sure I get the shot I need without risking my phone to the water. 
11843 Absolutely the best purchase 
11844 Very good mount but the screws that come with it strip easily - do not use the screws that come with the product -only good for sheetrock if that 
11845 Nice little camera amazing performance for the price. 
11846 Love my ringlight 
11847 Nice gr8 price 
11848 Works as expected. We lost our Nikon version and this cheaper version works just like the Nikon version. 
11849 Love it 
11850 Pretty. 
11851 Works! 
11852 lasted about 2 hours of non stop photo taking before needing charged 
11853 I should have measured my camera s screen first ! 
11854 Good quality film, and it lasted me a long time. 
11855 I love it! 
11856 Best camera of my equipment, good quality and reliable. 
11857 Great product and great support! 
11858 Good product 
11859 was unable to attach the arm to the stand as it doesn t fit at all, not even the mid section... 
11860 Used primarily for night photography and eliminated camera jitter due to camera motion when triggering the shutter. 
11861 Just as described 
11862 Good Product 
11863 I though it would have been to small and not have any sections but to my surprise it was perfect. love the color and it feels & look like a regular messenger handbag 
11864 It s everything Canon and everyone else who has one says it is and more. 
11865 Great Value! 
11866 Good easy to use zoom lens 
11867 AS ADVERTISED 
11868 Henry was fantastic with his support, so far camera is ok. 
11869 This seems to be just what I needed. 
11870 I loaded 10 pictures onto a flash drive to plug into the USB. It will only display 4 of them. I have no idea why that would be. It s a basic frame so I can t seem to find much information on it. Very, very annoying. 
11871 Returned it after finding many of the screws on the clamps were stripped out. If you get a good one probably not bad for the price. 
11872 We use this camera float mudder often as we are Floridians and &#34;live&#34; in the water. Its somewhat of a bulky fit for my petite female wrist and little unattractive but it does the job well. 
11873 Super durable! 
11874 Poor quality product. Battery never charges, buttons work randomly and after 2 months of use the volume buttons stop functioning. 
11875 It s been a good feature for airsoft 
11876 Excellent value - Provide hours of recording time in the Canon M41 camera. 
11877 Love it, work great. 
11878 Loved all the gadgets and the suction cup actually works on the hood of the car - it didn t budge at all. Good quality and lots of variety for a great price. 
11879 Perfect for my camera. Plugs into the wall and so keep one battery in camera and if I go out, I tuck the spare in with the camera. 
11880 No customer support ? Who is responsible here Agasio ? Foscam ? The support number dials Foscam and they say call Agasio ? Ridiculous 
11881 Do not buy Agasio 
11882 Works as expected. 
11883 I bought this for a wedding I was a second shooter at worked perfectly and I love it , the stars made it very easy to put on my flash when I needed it. It folds up very flat so doesn t take up much room in your bag. 
11884 I m not really sure if this works or doesn t work, or make a difference. But one thing I learned is to be careful how far I insert the cord tip into the conditioner. It can, and has, pulled out the cord tip, rendering the cord useless. 
11885 Charges battery but e charge on the camera runs out only after one hour of use! 
11886 Order arrived safely and quickly. 
11887 This camera is amazing! I have 3 other people interested in purchasing the same thing! 
11888 once adjusted to both eyes it works great, Good buy for the money 
11889 perfect 
11890 very good..... 
11891 Easy to use. Gives good light. A tiny bit too heavy for my flash--causing it to move the swivel. 
11892 Good price seems to be the same as the one with the Nikon logo but less cost. 
11893 awesome. no complaints 
11894 Works well, had for a while and still working well. Nights a little blurry but still good. I will try to put a photo or two on here of the night vision. In the next couple days.:-) 
11895 Polarizer arrived on time and was as advertised. Condition was very good and it works well with my 14-150mm telephoto lens. 
11896 like it a lot 
11897 They were not even close to what was advertised 
11898 Henry is good. 
11899 battery drains quickly but it works if used immediately. 
11900 This is one nifty little accessory. Many uses and very sturdy. I already had a ball head to use with it, if you don t, you might want to consider purchasing with the ball head. 
11901 The fit is acceptable, but a little loose. It comes off just a little too easily. 
11902 Exactly as described, works excellent! Bought as a gift specifically for the moon filter and they are greatly impressed with the quality and viewing capabilities that this kit offers as a suppliment to their Celestron telescope. 
11903 This lightweight camera has some great features and I think with be fabulous when travelling! 
11904 Great camera 
11905 it was great 
11906 Worked fine for 6 months, then started making corrupt files and ceasing recording at random intervals. Had to tell the cops that the hit and run I filmed was a corrupted file. No one was happy. 
11907 Love the Camera. Bit confused on some of the accessories that came with it.. some seem to be missing parts.... 
11908 Love...exactly what I needed 
11909 Bought this for my son-in-law, who had a camera bag, but it was big and bulky. He loves this as it is compact and he can take it with him hiking much easier. 
11910 I wish it had a wider panoramic view, other than that it is awesome! 
11911 Replacement for lost charger works 
11912 Always can use extra mounts 
11913 It is not good ,l will not recommend it to anyone, 
11914 No problem! 
11915 This case works well, but after swimming, the lens fogged up, ON THE INSIDE 
11916 Thanks you! Great job. Shipment did arrive late:( 
11917 This is the safest option for me to carry my cards. There is been a couple of instances where the cards are falling out of their places, but not enough for me to dock a star off of this review 
11918 Very Well Satisfied. Thanks. 
11919 I bought this to save a little money, and it broke the second day I had it. 
11920 Flies very well inside the house but is no good for outside 
11921 i use this to hang images at comic cons and it works great! sturdy and easy to set up. held up all 30 images. awesome purchase! 
11922 The pictures turned out great!! 
11923 Good quality but do not fit as well. 
11924 Very good, auto-focus works as long as there is enough light. I prefer to use it with a zoom lens since with a prime the distance object - lens is too critical. 
11925 Good addition to the Roam 3 bundle, exactly what it is....nothing more....nothing less... 
11926 Like the others, very nice, I have seen some ?? hoodlums walk be and sort of glanced around to find the other cameras, some fake many many real ones J R 
11927 Solid image quality. Interface not as good as GoPro, but otherwise can t find a flaw. Gopro accessories work well with it. Get a lot of interference when recording with auxiliary power source. 
11928 Excellent 
11929 great lens for close up work at school. 
11930 Worked for me......Takes a bit a skill to get a fine adjustment......course adjustment is quick and once locked with the thumb set screw very stable. So far only used with a 28 MM lens which is fairly light. 
11931 Protect your investment. 
11932 Works extremely well as a baby monitor with a phone app! 
11933 I liked the product 
11934 One of the connector that holds the strap to the bag broke within 6 months, the other one keep coming off from the bag. The bag is too deep to reach Not efficiently designed for its size Good thing that I got it free when I bought camera 
11935 Its answer to all my needs. 
11936 Nice work fine. 
11937 Perfect for my application, and I love the small footprint it has! 
11938 as described,easy to use 
11939 Doesn t work at night .... Not sure if I have something plugged in wrong. 
11940 Works perfectly, just what I needed 
11941 theses lenses are not meant for ipod touch 5th generation. it keeps falling off of my camera. 
11942 I was a bit apprehensive after reading a few of the reviews, but after a week s use in the field in hand-held flash mode for my macro photography, I have absolutely no complaints. 
11943 FAKE BUT THEY LOOK REAL! 
11944 This is a perfect bag for just about everything I do. Great for travel, casual movement between offices, trip with the family. From clothes to electronics and everything else. Great construction and already has taken quite the beating. The bag is holding up great. 
11945 OK ... it s supposedly a NIKON-made shutter release but the price (almost $40) is ridiculous ! It s well-made but NOT worth that much money. 
11946 Batteries last all day , recharge pretty quick. No Problems. Can never have to many batteries. 
11947 Excelente!!! 
11948 Fair enough 
11949 Product arrived on time and as advertised. Otherwise, what an I say? They re cleaning cloths. A good value for the money, and they do a good job, both for my glasses as well as (gently) cleaning camera lens filters. 
11950 Great for my two light stands with light socket attached. 
11951 everything was as stated in the product description and the quality is as expected and the price is good too 
11952 worked well, no issues or flaws found in product 
11953 Cool 
11954 Works great! Just like the ones that came with my other lenses. 
11955 Happy with my purchase 
11956 Its controls are way easier than others I bought my kids. 
11957 Very please with it 
11958 Perfect bundle! 
11959 Too small......got a bigger one 
11960 Great tool to have in your bag, doing a lot of GoPro filming like I do. It s nice to have a tool to be able to tighten it so tight it will not move. Using this when you have high impact stress helps to improve your video quality. 
11961 I couldn t be happier! I use this for monitoring the children when it s nap time. Super crisp images night or day. 
11962 Perfect for me... small,compact and easy to use. 
11963 Out of the eight pictures taken, only 4 developed. I have never seen instant camera film this bad. 
11964 Great zink paper 
11965 Very nice cameras! 
11966 Sharp images and vivid colours. 
11967 Does the job without extra wiring. 
11968 Knew it was vintage, actually looked used. Came with European wiring and plug. Had to replace plug, which took up the cost of the lamp. 
11969 The only bad thing, was 3 of them broke before the end of the roll of film. We ll see how the photos turned out in a few days. 
11970 I wouldn t recommended this for photography.. I use it for electronic pass thought for my canon s lens so I can control the aperture. The auto focus is to slow for any type of photography use 
11971 Good for the most part. Wish the case was better quality though, especially the inside padding 
11972 Exactly what I needed 
11973 seem to work well. I have had others that did not 
11974 for the money, not a bad buy. 
11975 This lens is crisp and clear! I am in no way a professional photographer, but love to photograph as a hobby. This was the perfect addition to my basic lens. 
11976 Works great. Adds stability to vertical shots. Adds weight with two batteries. 
11977 Well built. But it is tall if you have on a tripod and the slider. 
11978 Could see in lens. 
11979 Really good product stands up to what it says 
11980 Work very well on plastic lenses. Never have enough of these. As good as anything I have tried in the past. 
11981 Love the case and functionality of this item 
11982 Good strap easy to use, connects with other Op/Tech products, makes it easy to swap straps when needed. 
11983 I just got this so we have sometime to try it out, but I plan on coming back with and updated 30day review! For the price this is amazing! It came with so many extras and I m really excited to take it with us to the pool tomorrow 
11984 Works as advertised! Not much more to say than that! 
11985 LASTS LONGER THAN ORIGINAL BATT WOULD BUY AGAIN!! 
11986 Amazing quality. Just wish I had opted for the slightly higher model that had wifi, so I could connect to my smartphone. 
11987 Great zoom 
11988 nothing is more trusting than foggy camera lenses. These have helped, haven t had any issues since using them. 
11989 Can t use auto focus but these little lens adapters are pretty neat 
11990 After testing all the accesories in different scenarios I can say that this bundle is very good, specially for the price. Only negative point is the weekness of selfie stick 
11991 Stands seem a bit top heavy! 
11992 Working Great 
11993 amazing camera wrist strap. bought it for my nikon d3300 and it worked perfectly 
11994 Love it! 
11995 Great product. Delivery was fast and the covers fit my Gopro perfectly. 
11996 I found it in parrot story US by22.99$ 
11997 Must use on flat surface 
11998 Absolute must have when buying the ski phantom 2 drone 
11999 Awesome case! 
12000 The Promaster adds an extra layer of protection to your lens. As a bonus, it does not distort your pictures. 
12001 very good 
12002 Simple device that works well for various photo ops. 
12003 It worked great and we loved the wrist strap 
12004 Works great 
12005 worked well 
12006 hi l hace neewer nw565ex is there any setting to remove the beep every time i take a photo 
12007 Received in timely manner and was as advertised 
12008 I like it 
12009 It shipped quickly, the product works perfectly for land or water. I am very satisfied with this model. 
12010 Excellent kit, batteries last longer than gopro batteries. 
12011 Remarkable camera. Amazing feature set and great IQ. Feels good in the hand. 
12012 Does just what i thought it could do. Perfect! 
12013 Unit worked once then quit working. New egg and manufacturer FAILED TO refund or replace defective product after many requests. New egg passed responsibility to CHINA company who has not refunded for product. RIP OFFS 
12014 As advertised. 
12015 great light and can t beat the price. Works greats off camera with my two other Canon Speedlites. 
12016 .they all get along like one big happy family!! 
12017 Just what i needed. 
12018 Work fine and was what we were looking for 
12019 Glad to have another battery 
12020 Very good product 
12021 Great camera! Great video quality! This being said: The default IP differs from the documentation; the bundled software also kinda sucks... I recommend the Blue Iris software instead. 
12022 I love this selfie stick! Wonderful quality! I had before stick from be bath and beyond and the quality sucked! This stick is amazing: easy to manipulate, holds phone well and has a nice color! Love it! I always have it with me ;) 
12023 The video not clear. The sound is bad and nosy. The detect move notification is late. It is really useless 
12024 Bought several of these cases. They work great and are a bargain. 
12025 Awesome value. Simple setup. Well done. 
12026 nice and compact but sturdy 
12027 was looking for an underwater stick to use for scuba/snorkeling.. this worked awesome 
12028 I love my filters! They improve my photos so much! 
12029 So far so good. I almost went with a SLR but prefer a pocket-sized because of so many activities with my kids. 
12030 Excellent, watches over the contents of my garage 
12031 I m so unhappy , the mobile holder was broken as you can see in the photo 
12032 Just as described. 8 year old loves it. There is a learning curve to flying but he has mastered it. There were a few crashes in the beginning but the copter held up fine. 
12033 Haven t put a 5 star yet because I m not 100% finished hooking up everything at the dvr, but so far everything is great!! Quality material and everything works. Can t beat the price either 
12034 great value except battery charger charges the batteries slow 
12035 I was worried about sacrificing quality to get such a...portable lens. I didn t have to worry. 
12036 Great Item. 
12037 Hands down the fastest I ve ever received any product. Great quality! Recommend to use this seller. 
12038 Excellent 
12039 Product packaging solid, fully applicable to outdoor sports, good quality, practical，I have used the suction cup and it did a fantastic job,and will use other accessories for a free time 
12040 Not bad 
12041 The on/off switch does not work with my Canon HF G-20 camera. Does the endless cycle (on/off) as has been reported on other cameras in review section. Zoom does work 
12042 Good quality bag. I use it for my Fuji X100S, which fits just barely. I wish Billingham made a bigger version, as well. I would love to use this as a camera sleeve for my Leica M. 
12043 Great exposure and very easy for me to use! 
12044 easy to use, just love it - this was a replacement as I lost the first one 
12045 Stick and move... This is better than a bare flash gun will ever be. Nice soft focused light. Cats wait for no man. 
12046 Terrible it didn t work at all, it didn t show any recording only lines across. Don t by it just try a different one. 
12047 So far, so good.. 
12048 I ve used this type of Nikon flash for years now. Very reliable, durable, great quality, always great performance. I like its light and compact size. 
12049 Wasn t quite as heavy duty as I thought it would be but it worked for the low price. 
12050 Am old school and like 35mm. This does a great job for what I need. 
12051 Great performance 
12052 I love the ability for family to send photos via email. 
12053 Unable to use the suction cup, I think it requires a housing for the gopro camera that snaps onto the suction cup and the same goes for the chest strap. 
12054 Great product and deal. I bought this for my son, who likes to make movies and he absolutely loves it. The stand is just a tabletop model, I thought it would be bigger, but it folds down, so my son leaves it on all the time. 
12055 So far, so good! Holds a big charge. 
12056 I am not really sure if it did cleaning job. I have not noticed any difference either in playing a tape or recording. 
12057 Battery type and no recharge when connected to computer. All other features are good. 
12058 A compact camera bag with comforted anti-theft features, nicely done! 
12059 Works great! 
12060 Worked ok but very disappointed that it did not come with the device. 
12061 Exactly what I was looking for 
12062 Nice deal and fast delivery 
12063 Great item. Quick shipping! 
12064 Works. I have not tried a battery drain but what I see so far looks great. 
12065 Does not seem to last as long as the Canon battery that came with my camera. But for the price I am satisfied. 
12066 Works great. Plenty of peices so you can get the camera at any angle you d like. 
12067 It works and charges 2 at once, but it feels cheap and the electronic display of the charge is wrong. 
12068 Lack of instructions with the piece means you need to do a little research, but works as expected. 
12069 Love it. I may look like a dork, but its easier to take selfies. Had to work a bit to download software, but stick works great. 
12070 Great product at a great value!!! 
12071 Perfect replacement if you lose your original lens caps and covers. 
12072 this does not work for a Canon 5d mark iii, they say it does but it doesnt. Will return. 
12073 Very useful. 
12074 Very nice in quality ! Happy with my purchase, also came a day early! 
12075 great bag for city shooting. Walked around downtown many times with this bag. 
12076 good 
12077 I m in love with this lens!!! I love not having to change lenses all the time!! Defiantly worth every penny!! And all the extras!!! Wow I was amazed!! 
12078 [[VIDEOID:69cd76e77c27154e03a263510f0419fe]] Camera take great videos. Came with lots of accessories. Waterproof case works great. Great camera for the price.

12079 It fits! 
12080 Nice small camera bag, a little too fat once you put and extra battery in it, but it will work 
12081 i m glad i purchased the hand trap, however, i haven t used it yet but the cost was great. i ve seen lots of professional photographers using their hand strap so i m sure when i use mind I will be glad i purchased it. 
12082 Excellent !! 
12083 Did not work right out. The box I was hard to pair the controller to the unit and it did not hover it was all or nothing on speed And after about 60 min. Of run time all the unit wanted to do was flip. 
12084 I like it alot for the price. when panning or tilting it does not move very smooth but that is to be expected with a tripod in this price range. 
12085 Good looking product. Not to sturdy tho, it will fall apart soon..but for the time being, it will suffice. 
12086 It s a must 
12087 Only buy your batteries OEM. Period. 
12088 Fast delivery and great product 
12089 best 
12090 Great product. Wish the seller could give some different recommendations on how it could be used. I searched YouTube for all kinds of ways you can use the straps. I was able to put it on my ski boot while snow skiing. It was awesome shots! 
12091 Very good 
12092 The package really saved a lot of money for us. This has all the functioning accessories for a semi-professional photographer. 
12093 very nice portable instruction booklet that be placed into camera bag 
12094 Nice camera cover 
12095 it s great 
12096 how do I return it Can t get it to work most of the time on my Samsung Galaxy S 4 I phone. 
12097 too lightweight...not good at all 
12098 Worked as expected 
12099 for the price, they are exactly why we need. they aren t SUPER durable, but thats not what we are looking for. people knock over our flash stands ALL the time, so its nice to have something thats faithful and replaceable if broken. 
12100 Simple but it s nicely made and it works 
12101 Excellent 
12102 so far so good bought less expensive model a year ago and screen looked schattered with colors and was disappointed after my first one lasted so long without problems 
12103 My daughter loves her camera, and this film worked out well for us. 
12104 Love this product! 
12105 Very good price More importantly, the product works as advertised. I replaced the deteriorating mounts with the new mounts which immediately connected to the system through the wiring. Thus far, the product is operation properly. 
12106 Just what I needed 
12107 as advirtised 
12108 good product 
12109 Worked just as good if not better than the original I am on my fourth photo shoot and have 38% still active I definitely recommend these batteries 
12110 I swap out the batteries all the time, they charge quick and I always have a good battery to go to 
12111 Excellent GoPro pole. Light and medium sized. 
12112 NICE ITEM 
12113 It s good for its price 
12114 Works good. Camera quality is not the best but does a job. Easy to install. 
12115 This item worked nicely 
12116 I try this for my iPhone 6 Plus. The thing is top heavy and keep ripping over not matter how I adjust this thing. 
12117 cheap yet very good quality head mount for GoPro camera 
12118 Easy to set up and sync. Tried it with both mine and my husband s phones (Samsung S5 & S6) and worked great. Can t wait to take it on vacation. Extends easily and the product has a tight hold on my phone. Love the color as well :) 
12119 Great product. Highly recommend. 
12120 Good simple case that fits my Panasonic DMC-FZ70 perfectly. I keep battery and charger in front pocket and SD cards in flap pocket. I like it. 
12121 Very nice came one time 
12122 very good 
12123 Great bang for your buck 
12124 So far works and my VHS camera hasn t fallen off. 
12125 Great product and price! Fit on my Nikon lens without any problem. You won t be disappointed in buying this one. 
12126 The lenses are awesome, but the way they attach to the phone is really annoying and can crack your screen if you re not careful. Good lenses though. 
12127 The selfie stick looks very cute. The button is sensitive. The selfie stick is convenient to take picture. Like it very much. 
12128 Use these in my RV for a bit of security. Stay put and do the job. Great seller! 
12129 Used this on the three week trip to Alaska, knowing the my regular strap would kill my neck. Love this!!! 
12130 Love this lens. It was priced right and is excellent quality. I would recommend it to anyone that loves prime lenses. 
12131 Great product. Light and easy to carry. Heavy duty endurance! 
12132 The &#34;handle bar&#34; piece fits my roll cage in my car 
12133 Cheap product, memory card inserted all the way into the camera instead of clicking into place. You can t record on a card that is floating around inside the camera. 
12134 Good mounts and good price 
12135 You get a really cool perspective on your snokeling with this mask, relive the moments of feeding fish all around you! 
12136 I love this! I put it in a tote bag when I don t need my whole camera bag and gear and just look like anyone else on the street. 
12137 FAST, AS PROMISED 
12138 Good one I am using it for pat 2 years. 
12139 One side of my Big lights don t work. Other than that the product is a great buy. 
12140 Since the camera didn t come with it, I had to get this product, which complements it perfectly and the neoprene is comfortable. 
12141 This polarizing filter works extremely well for the price. I can detect no noticeable distortion in images in which it has been used. 
12142 Nice set of filters in a nice holder. The Polarizing filter works well with the UV used to protect the lens. 
12143 Fantastic ,works great and excellent service 
12144 Unbelievably efficient. 
12145 I d give it 5 stars if it were metal, otherwise it is very real. Photo sensor shuts it off during daylight to save batteries. The IR LEDs for night vision are just like the real thing. Very real looking if you are 10+ft away. 
12146 Got this for my mom. It is so easy to set up. We already loaded hundreds of photos and it has great quality. I thought this might be too big but it s perfect. Best gift ever. And the best part is that it will constantly be updated for her! 
12147 The zoom feature is nice, however the picture quality is not much better than my 800 TV lines of resolution from my Zosi camera at one third the price. Rain tends to stick to the lens and distort the image. 
12148 Worked as expected 
12149 These are replacement batteries for my new Leica Q. Rather than paying over $100 for Leica s battery, this Wasabi package includes two batteries, life same as Leica, and includes a great dual-volt charger. 
12150 very good tripod for photo and video. i recomand 
12151 Thx 
12152 Works perfect. Fast shipping. 
12153 So far, a good solid camera that takes good pictures. My daughter took it to Europe, and the pictures turned out pretty good. 
12154 This works alright. With snappier rounds, it can get a little loose. I haven t had a problem with my .22 or 9mm. We put it on my friends .40 and it tended to fly around a little. 
12155 Easy to set up and works great. 
12156 A+ 
12157 GREAT battery 
12158 Great lens 
12159 Great price fast shipping it works great 
12160 Purchased for the PowerShot SX700. Battery life appears equivalent or better than Canon battery that came with camera. Takes recharging well. Good to have reliable spare batteries for several hours of continuous camera use, with and without flash. 
12161 No need for an expensive one, this is all you need. Unless you like wasting extra money for no reason. 
12162 great product well worth the money... 
12163 Can t really ask for more so far so good awesome product 
12164 Excelent add-on to the GoPro, and nice bang for your buck. 
12165 Great little camera, easy to use. 
12166 Its camera was really awesome 
12167 i can even connect it with mywifi router also using its WPS button.all over i would like to 
12168 This is my first hefty photography purchase, I m a beginner and I would absolutely recommend this. It s been great so far. 
12169 Used it on vacation and got excellent photos. 
12170 I have to revise my initial review. This product mostly worked as advertised for about a month, maybe less then suddenly stopped working. I emailed the seller for guidance with no luck. Be Wary 
12171 Do not buy! Flies away on its own! Totally lost all my money and gopro4 
12172 Arrived earlier than I expected. I didn t like the packaging, but I like the bag very much--that matters. Fits my Canon SLR with a battery grip and an 18-135mm lens. There s still a room for one more lens but I don t wanna overload it. 
12173 I was pleasantly surprised at how well this portable vocal booth helped to isolate noise and give me clean vocals! I m very satisfied with it! 
12174 It works just as well as any lens cloth I ve used. Even though the top doesn t have a closure to keep the cloth in place I haven t had any problems with it falling out because it s a tight enough fit. 
12175 I love it! 
12176 for me, the price is equivalent with its quality. it is ok to shoot not quickly moving subjects. for better shoot, you need .... a tripod. a very very good tripod 
12177 Awesome!! 
12178 Works exactly as advertised. Has pockets and a drink bottle holder.. Makes it easy to hike around with the inspire 
12179 Just what I needed to replace my lost charger 
12180 well built tripod and I love it 
12181 very good product! 
12182 Solid buy for a much cheaper price than the canon version. I haven t used the canon version, so I can t necessarily compare the difference of the two. 
12183 The lights are great and illuminate my studio set for video and photo as expected. I would ve rated it a 5 star if it came with a carry bag. 
12184 I love this Will be using it on a trip in a few days But I have gotten some great selfie with this with my pets. 
12185 Received this product at a discount in exchange for an unbiased review This tripod is awesome!! We ve been using it with our kindle to watch movies! The legs are very flexible and we are able to make a stand that stands on our couch!! We love it!! 
12186 All perfect! 
12187 Does what it needs to do. 
12188 SO AMAZING. So cute and cheap& the texture of the front and back is bubbly. It is so amazing and holds the polaroids great!! 
12189 Its awesome cut my recharge time in half which allows me time for shooting pictures thank you 
12190 The item looks very good. Also, the seller is very responsive and supportive. 
12191 exactly what I needed. 
12192 well worth price for on the go Videos.. I use if for my Golf outings... nice !! 
12193 Superb glass quality achromatic lens, made in Japan. A rare find as new. Works great on my Sigma DP2 Merrill. 
12194 Got this as a gift, it came quick and was exactly what they wanted. 
12195 works great and super portable! 
12196 Great little tripod base. Legs are long which give solid support to the attached top heavy cell phone. 
12197 Perfect fit. Fast shipping. Thank you! 
12198 Yeah, I used this to store my anker charger and 2 extra batteries. I don t want to damage my battery so yeah. This thing keeps it getting crushed inside my backpack. 
12199 Purchased this for my GoPro Hero+LCD and it works great. It fits everything all my accessories and extra mounts I have with plenty of room. 
12200 Very delicate, instructions not very helpful. Broke second time using it. 
12201 Battery was an exact fit! Camera working great 
12202 Works like the original. 
12203 I used this to mount a Baby Monitor near my baby s crib. It is just okay. It doesn t grip that well and caused it to slide down all the time. I also bought another one with a better grip (cushion instead of plastic) and it s WAY better. 
12204 Exactly what I needed! 
12205 Fantastic Umbrella 
12206 Great product and shipped fast. 
12207 One star. 
12208 Feels cheap 
12209 THIS SD STORAGE CASE IS GREAT! 
12210 the perfect starter cleaning kit for a camera 
12211 A OK!! 
12212 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTC3eUorRMU Here is how I used it I think it worked great for us 
12213 [[ASIN:B00LAVA2OW EEEKit 8-in-1 Accessories Kit for Gopro HERO 4 Session LCD Black/Silver HD 3+/3/2/1 Camera]] It all came as advertised, and I am impressed with the assortment of accesories. I have not fitted the camera to these accessories yet, but it looks like it should all work. I m happy. 
12214 Great product and works as expected. 
12215 Absolutely amazing camera. More than I need. 
12216 you get what you paid for. items are not super premium but ok as they re not expensive, the straps for head and chest are totally worth it. 
12217 They do the job but if I would had known exactly what I was looking for I would have went with a better brand 
12218 This product is fine. It didn t get five stars due to the fact the band that holds the filters in place doesn t work to well. 
12219 I have two cameras now. Great picture, and lets me keep an eye on my dog while I m gone to work. 
12220 Very good generic cable for my cam 
12221 Thick, Soft! Will last forever. Beautiful flower design as you see it, orange/red, yellow, green with gold vase! :) 
12222 I upgraded a few months ago from the Canon t3i and I LOVE this camera! My quality of images has improved immensely, and it wasn t hard to learn how to use it. I would definitely recommend this camera! 
12223 its ok 
12224 smaller than I thought but work well - good price and quick delivery 
12225 Perfect! 
12226 my order arrived dirty 
12227 this backpack holds my dji phantom 2 vison plus v3 and all the equipment needed to fly except my ipad tri pod i have to carry it seperately and i still have one free hand.I don t know if it is the best backpack but it works perfectly for me. 
12228 They work 
12229 Firmware wrong! Don t buy 
12230 Awesome! Charges quickly and very easy to use. It is a must for Gopro users. 
12231 really good film. although taking pictures outside normally makes the picture over exposed. the film lasts for a long time and is just great over all. 
12232 Great quality images but super awkward to hold. I think that s ultimately why this body was discontinued. 
12233 This is such a good buy! It protects my camera from scratches and I get so much compliment on the case. 
12234 This has helped me so much! 
12235 Digital Goja was great, everything came as advertised. All the items were working properly. My only concern is that the Sigma Lens itself takes soft pictures, in general. I think it still is a good walk-around lens but I wish it could take sharper images. 
12236 I have both this camera and a Go Pro brand. I found this one to be much easier to use, lighter weight without feeling cheap and much less expensive! 
12237 Love this camera. Easy to use, takes great pictures. And takes AA batteries. 
12238 good price/value 
12239 Love my flip camera. I use in my classroom. 
12240 works as expected 
12241 Good quality mic with a very accessible price 
12242 Best Goods. I love it.!!! 
12243 Perfection 
12244 This is nice speedlite works like a charm. 
12245 Camera works fine 
12246 Good inexpensive lightweight portable tripod. Not to flimsy, good fit for small lightweight cameras. Nice to come with a carry case also. 
12247 I really like this viewfinder that enables you to take reflective readings, and it is easy to install and remove with the Sekonic light meter. Using the light meter with this has really helped my pictures. So far have just used it for landscape pictures. 
12248 Fullfill my expectations... 
12249 these are good cameras for the money 
12250 Works Great 
12251 I like the filter set but the filter holder could be a little stronger :):) otherwise the filters work well 
12252 It fits. Not loosening up 
12253 One battery can t last for 20 shots, though the other is fine. 
12254 It met my expectations. For the price, it s worth it. The resolution is somewhat limited. 
12255 I absolutely love these for the price! I bought one a year ago and just bought the 2nd. 
12256 Took it on mission trip to Guatemala. Gave more than 400 kids the first picture that they had ever had of themselves. Took picture of 88year old lady. When I gave it to her, she said it was first time she had a picture. 
12257 My stabilizer broke 1 DAY INTO SHOOTING! this is absolutely ridiculous & I would love to hear an explanation! 
12258 Some photographs are priceless...you ll ensure capturing the shot with a back up battery!!! This one will be used with my TG4 Olympus. 
12259 It works great with my Sony Nex 6. 
12260 Very good bridge camera. Options and online help have been very good. This kit from Amazon was all it promised, although I upgraded to faster/bigger memory right away. Very good photos, but best in class video. 
12261 Excellent product. 
12262 I got exactly what I needed for the price 
12263 They work well, and at a great price. 
12264 The batteries are great, the charger works, and it was a fraction of the price of the OEM version. 
12265 Had to replace..it did failed after several charges! 
12266 its not working...... 
12267 As described. Thanks 
12268 doesn t hold much 
12269 Showed up fast, works great. It replaced a DJI Vision 2+. 
12270 Perfect lens! 
12271 Great so far!, 
12272 Bad product that doesnt work at all 
12273 Great camera for the price. 
12274 Looks nothing like the picture on the box.Just clear through cheap plastic. Cant get the film roller to turn.Acts like it is locked into position. Then what could you expect for 10.00? Hopefully I can return it. 
12275 No complaints. 
12276 Great item, holds good charge, fits camera perfect. 
12277 Excellent product and seller. 
12278 Nice small simple camera. Does everything that I need a camera to do. 
12279 I needed a polarizer and lens hood for my zoom lens. This worked just fine. I like the cleaning brush. 
12280 Great for what it is 
12281 Great value, looking forward to purchasing other sizes for other lenses. 
12282 Great product, great price, no issues with it being refurbished. 
12283 battery works great. used with large Tamron 150-600mm lens and never wore out battery for a full day of wildlife shooting. 
12284 Plastic but feels good quality. Good for the money. Good as an entry level flash. 
12285 I might like it more if the product would have instructions on how to use it.. having great difficulty collimating my celestron reflecting telescope. 
12286 Love the color and touch screen and ease of use.... But it SUCKS UP YOUR BATTERY FAST. 
12287 Not quite what I expected 
12288 Excellent product with a comfortable grip and takes very good photos. 
12289 ok 
12290 Bought this for my son so he can use some legacy Canon FD lenses on his Canon digital camera. It works fine, and is well made. No problems focusing throughout the entire range. This is a good product. Recommended. 
12291 Great Picture ! 
12292 Delivered as advertised 
12293 Compact and useful. Wish I had had one of these years ago. 
12294 very useful but no adjustment of light 
12295 Total junk. Needle was stuck from time took it out and would never move. 
12296 Returned bought a different dropcam 
12297 Quality product, and one of the few I have seen that allow you to insert 4x6 pictures both horizontally and vertically, thereby allowing you to view vertical pictures without having to twist and turn the book around constantly. 
12298 Thanks 
12299 Product arrived on time and was as described. Perfect condition. Thank you ;-) 
12300 High quality. Thick cable. Rugged. 
12301 Small but perfect for this camera. 
12302 This battery was perfect. I have a battery that came with my Canon EOS Rebel T5, but sometimes forgot to recharge. So I decided that backup battery would be best. No complaints at all. It charges well and fit perfectly inside of my camera. 
12303 Just came off of vacation, worked great. 
12304 Dont buy this unless you have a warehouse size studio. Too many pieces to assemble. I wish I had saved my money because I never use it. In fact, I ve never used it. 
12305 Very good!! 
12306 Thank you 
12307 Great product, great customer service! 
12308 as back up batteries PERFECT Work with camera charge time a little short 
12309 Perfect for the backpack 
12310 Very short range! Went back to my 5yr old bunker hill(works most of the time). 
12311 I have given this a 5 star rating because of the vast selection of attachments, the price and the speed at which it was delivered. Each item is sturdy and well built. Most impressed. 
12312 Excellent a must have for a Sony camera 
12313 Kenneth done the best cx service very helpful.so happy.nice camera 
12314 Great choice! great service from company! 
12315 My son loves it and uses it in our pool a lot. 
12316 works well 
12317 I hate it. Not comfortable. Still slips down when you lift the camera up to take a picture. Tried it for a long time, now looking for something better. 
12318 great working, looks fine. 
12319 These cameras have very poor color rendition. 
12320 Good lens for shooting moon. 
12321 I loved it! Thank u ! 
12322 Photos came out fantastic!! I have an older Polaroid that I found at an estate sale and I was very hesitant about with to get for it. This site helped me a lot! Although it came out a little more yellow it had more to do with the Polaroid. 
12323 I love this. It s wonderfully sturdy with a great grip, and yet compact enough to carry in the tripod straps of your camera bag. Easy release attachment at the top is an extra plus. Well worth the price. 
12324 Works as advertised 
12325 Perfect fit case. 
12326 Very nice camera 
12327 Everything works and does the job. Light weight and easy to carry, like to a waterfall. Not made for rough handeling and I would not recommend use by children as the legs could be bent. 
12328 Didn t use right away. By the time we started using it, found out that there was a glitch in the remote and had to spend an additional $50 for download cable and update, just so we could use the remote control 
12329 A little bit tight for my WB350F but still a decent case. 
12330 great product. Works as described 
12331 Picked this up for my light painting brushes, seams well made, and is just the right size for all my flashlights and attachments. 
12332 Nice eyepieces.I have purchased several of these--the 31mm,19mm,10mm and 7mm all work as advertised 
12333 The 3 second delay between detected motion and picture taken along with poor focus gave no useful pictures. 
12334 It doesn t come with the memory card as of Aug 2015. 
12335 This did not work. It did not pick up dust from the sensor of my digital camera. 
12336 Perfect size and nicely padded. 
12337 My granddaughter loves this, 
12338 Know that this product comes from China and may take time to arrive. Product works nice in that it covers both the eye piece as well as the LCD screen. Only downside is that it easily rocks back and forth (left and right) fairly easily. 
12339 Exactly what it said it was. Fits my Canon 18-135mm EF-S perfectly. 
12340 Looks real! Especially for the price! 
12341 This battery pack was the perfect replacement. The price was was fair as well. Highly recommend. 
12342 It took weeks to get here from China. Phantom 3 fits in there great. You have to remove the tablet holder from the remote and no place for tablet inside. Not super rugged, but is much better than a floppy, soft-sided bag. Couldn t beat the price! 
12343 not work with my printer!!!(Polaroid Zip Instant Mobile Printer) 
12344 Nice little camera case. 
12345 worked well while scuba diving no wories about camera floating off 
12346 great for a beginner like me. 
12347 DOES NOT WORK WITH THE NIKON D3200. 
12348 I love this product so much.... I have searched all over for something that was suitable for my camera and I finally found it. The price is perfect, the quality is very good and the slider is perfect and ready to go whenever you need it. I highly recommend it! 
12349 Easy setup, better video quality than the garbage cameras I used to install in Wal-Marts and the remote monitoring, motion detection, sound, wireless capabilities are all a plus. A consumer friendly product with commercial grade (or better) uses. 
12350 Works great with Nikon 18-140mm NIKKOR (67mm). See attached photo made with +4 close up. 
12351 came quickly, works well. 
12352 It makes people look younger!!!! Great one!!!! 
12353 Perfect for small camera. 
12354 The microscope works well but the package was received without the CD and the free CD memory. RL 
12355 Took it to 80 feet, no problem. 
12356 It is literally useless 
12357 it gets the picture in negative color them drops to static and its only 30 feet away. Waste of money 
12358 very cheso and a waste. 
12359 Like it very much 
12360 Great set for new photographer. 
12361 Great little optic - very handy for hunts on the move! 
12362 Works perfectly for my gopro hero3, battery pack, and lcd screen. No issues charging. 
12363 Handy and useful! 
12364 The strap is comfortable but not without problems. Most importantly, the metal buckle reaches around to the fragile camera LCD screen so it can potentially damage it. 
12365 Never held a charge. Useless. 
12366 Doesn t work from the pc. I can only use it with my iPad. Very buggy and not worth the purchase. 
12367 Product as expected. 
12368 love this product. 
12369 Works great for trouble shooting. 
12370 Love the variety in the patterns/designs. Perfect for my 13 yr old and her cousin 
12371 I would love to be able to rate this product, however it came with no instructions... I would probably give it more stars if I could use it. 
12372 Excellent Quality 
12373 Junk! 
12374 I matched this with a Opteka MP100 monopod for a trip to Africa, as a full tripod would be too bulky to carry and use on Safari. 
12375 Perfect! 
12376 Wonderful quality. Not lightweight but carries well with its shoulder strap. I didn’t think I could afford binoculars this nice. 
12377 These were a great cost effective replacement for our stock cannon batteries. worked great. 
12378 I was hoping it would be a bit smaller, but its super loud and great otherwise. Definitely makes me feel safer. 
12379 This charger does the trick. I plug in 5 batteries and an hour or so later they are all charged and ready to go. That gives me a good 45 minutes of flying time to include changing them out. Much better than the one-battery charger that comes with the quadcopter. 
12380 lot of camera for the dollar 
12381 It stated it fit my camera but it didn t. Otherwise the quality was good 
12382 As good or better than the original batteries! 
12383 This is beautiful, looks amazing, Exceeded expectation for appearance. Don t know yet about how it holds up. 
12384 Light but strong lens cap keeper without any exposed metal scratchy parts. 
12385 it works great 
12386 So happy 
12387 GREAT EQUIPMENT at a GREAT PRICE!!! 
12388 Great product....the quality of the video really good too. My son really enjoys it. It is great family fun for all of us. 
12389 What a deal! These work just fine and the price is right. 
12390 Simply awesome 
12391 I m hoping these batteries will last longer than the last ones I purchased. 
12392 Did not work. 
12393 Great! Live the product...records great...just had to get extra device for cell phone viewing! But very happy overall thanks 
12394 This is an amazing camera. Super easy to set up. Great app. I can check on my home anytime. I can move the camera by swiping the screen. I am ordering additional cameras for other areas of my home. Great camera, great price! 
12395 After ordering and receiving the camera lens I found that it didn t fit, I contacted the reseller they sent an adapter ring, it works fine now. I am very happy with this reseller they went out there way make thing right. 
12396 Ordered 2 and both did not work. 
12397 Batteries don t fully charge or hold a charge for very long. Total waste of money. Don t buy. 
12398 Good!! 
12399 Very Good 
12400 I got this lens for wild life photography. It is heavy, but well worth the trouble. I ve gotten great shots across a lake, without any loss of image quality. This lens is Sigma s better quality, better sealing, better glass. I think it s great!! 
12401 Love it. Fast delivery 
12402 Not sharp at all. I use this for skateboarding 
12403 Worked perfect. Unfortunately the item I got it for was a piece of crap. But I ll hang onto this, never know if I ll need it. Sucks, cause now I don t actually need it. Grrr! oh well.... 
12404 I use this everyday and it produces some excellent pics plus other photographers are always interested in my camera. 
12405 Sharp. I use this lens all of the time. 
12406 Does not work with my camera as advertised..Total rip off. So disappointed. Might stop shopping on Amazon. Sellers require no creditabilty. 
12407 I would not describe as pro-grade but probably comparable to other tripods for the price. 
12408 Worked Flawlessly. 
12409 Great warning system that is inexpensive yet gets the job done. 
12410 Works as described although as many people have said and I can attest to it that the IR extender receiver doesn t work. 
12411 Spectacular lens. Extremely sharp on the Pentax 645Z, great contrast, and small footprint. Great grip. Little to no flare, even shooting directly into the sun. Only minor quibble is that there is some purple fringing against bright light. Fantastic value. 
12412 Recommended by fro knows photo, yeah its OK, pretty simple, limited use since there is no zoom. 
12413 This did not meet my expectation at all. I returned it to the vendor. 
12414 Solid product and a good cost benefit. Great for everyday shooting. Good materials and well made. 
12415 Makes you feel like a pro! Love all sides and works great for making pics better lighting 
12416 This was far better quality than I expected for $10. 
12417 works just like the originals 
12418 Didn t charge anymore after the first power up 
12419 Nikon does not recommend. Suggested using them could possibly void warranty. Returned for refund. 
12420 Loved it I take it wherever I go! 
12421 This camera is a must for every hello kitty fan. It s adorable and very much worth the price. Easily the cutest camera I have ever owned & a crowd pleaser as well. 
12422 Great product, high quality, arrived quickly in the mail. 
12423 Works but battery doesn t fit 100% straight away. Gotta jiggle it to snap on. 
12424 They fit well, good replacement! 
12425 good 
12426 These are legit. 
12427 Well designed, very functional. Light weight. 
12428 Bad battery. if leave charging all night will only fill half battery but if you leave charging for a couple hours will be 90% but don t last to long before die so I can t charge overnight and I can t trust when is full. 
12429 Caps better designed than original manufacturer s cap. 
12430 Used our floats at the beach and they worked very well. Love the bright colors for easy detection in the water. Only concern is the thin cord which could break easily. Only time will tell for that. Excellent customer service! 
12431 Fantastic little radio triggers!! Love em. 
12432 This battery did not work. Will never buy again. 
12433 Has been a great pack for my SLR! It has kept it safe on hikes and during travel! 
12434 Everything arrived in a timely fashion. All was as advertised. Best of all the hoods and filter work well together and readily go on my 52 mm lenses. I am very satisfied. 
12435 Perfect 
12436 Perfect fit. Sturdy. 
12437 A++++++++ 
12438 works like a charm! 
12439 Its just good 
12440 A gift--got rave reviews. 
12441 This worked great for about three months then the legs started loosening up. 
12442 This is great looks almost faded though. Not real bright. 
12443 Didn t work out for me 
12444 Excellent 
12445 Named after horseradish LMAO!! Works okay and price is good. Just for backup. I use the Nikon battery as long as it has juice. 
12446 Love it. Who would have thought that something so inexpensive could make my $250 Canon speedlite better. Fits perfectly and seems to provide 
12447 Optically excellent. I m coming from the crappy 28-100mm f/3.5-5.6 kit lens from 2002. If your sample has the squeak it s really annoying. Oh, well. That s what I get for going the cheapest used I could find. 
12448 It s handy and compact, but sometimes the camera makes it too top-heavy if you re using it as a tripod...the little legs are not enough of a base. Works well for hand extension though! 
12449 Pretty good. Better than low end go pros but not as good as the very expensive ones. But for the price you can t complain. 1080p 30fps and a screen. 
12450 very good for this price, i use rarely, so, cant say a lot about it 
12451 Gr8 product for the price i pay 
12452 Fits my Panasonic Lumix camera at a great price for 2 batteries and charger. Charger also recharges Panasonic battery that came with the camera. Panasonic doesn t provide charger for the battery. Camera has to be plugged in & that is a nuisance. This way I always have extra batteries. 
12453 liner not glued very well! selfie stick spins around!! HEAD GEAR GREAT!! 
12454 Doesn t work. or i was sent a remote with a dead battery 
12455 Loving this Dlink Wireless 
12456 Works perfectly 
12457 Very good quality, indistinguishable from a name brand item. 
12458 Love the improvements. 
12459 For the price it is great. It takes some getting use to for opening but it makes sense when you see it 
12460 Love this camera. The price is really good compared to the same exact model at Best Buy. 
12461 Convenient for my DSLR. Haven t tried remote but that was one of the major reasons I bought this package. Great combo. 
12462 Gets the job done.clear picture works great. 
12463 Good price ... exactly as expected. 
12464 Excellent 
12465 Very good quality for the price 
12466 This is the new hobby to keep me relatively 
12467 Good, versatile bag. Nice solution for dividing compartments and to take out the entire cushion assembly. Very good weatherproofing. I am missing smaller organizing pockets, say, in the flap. Carrying options: shoulder strap, hand carrying strap, attach to suitcase. 
12468 items are ok to use. 
12469 Glad to see I m not the only one who couldn t fold the thing back up!! Will be making a trip to YouTube for a video! Great size though! Large enough for someone to get in and move around comfortably. 
12470 Easy to use and the included case is a plus 
12471 Love it 
12472 So in love with the cell phone mount for my go pro. Now I can take it to theme parks and it s easier to record/shoot pictures and videos! I do recommend this product to other people!! 
12473 the stand is pretty good quality for its price.............the fabric is thick and heavy...........i would buy again 
12474 Battery fit into charger but could not get battery out of charger. Had to use a small screw driver. 
12475 only used it for a day and it broke. Invest the extra bucks for quality. Lesson Learned 
12476 I like it 
12477 Excelente producto. 
12478 I bought this lens as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it. It came to my house right on time and there are no problems with it. Overall it was a perfectly successful order. 
12479 Great 
12480 Great lens cleaners at an unbeatable price. 
12481 Didn t work at all! 
12482 it really helps when video recording with a camera that has no light 
12483 So far so good. 
12484 The product was perfect in condition and package was apt. I d recommend this to anyone looking for an intermediate level photography. 
12485 Great product! 
12486 Works perfectly and such a great deal. Definitely recommend for shots where a slow shutter speed is needed and you want to eliminate any camera shake. 
12487 Like the idea it seems to work but there is no way to play SD card on your computer you have to use the dvr I thought you would be able to emailed several time hard to get point across its sitting in a box 
12488 works great the only downer is my lens cap does not fit it as it is bigger opening but it functions like a pro. 
12489 Took it and phone to shop and they couldn t get anything out of even after hours of trying to charge it. 
12490 Great color. I should have gone with a smaller width. I ended up cutting mine, which was a pain, so keep that in mind. Paper is very sturdy and suits my needs well. I love not having to deal with fabric wrinkles. 
12491 Awesome idea. Didn t fully test it but I also bought Joto waterproof pouch and brought my iPhone on the river. 
12492 the best thing ever ;) 
12493 Looks good and fits well. A good idea for protecting the lens but have no way of evaluating the optical benefits. 
12494 Illuminati 
12495 a great handycam 
12496 Excellent product. Strong, light and easily carried on airplanes. Brilliant idea. Works well with my SonyAE7R light-weight full-frame. I ve had several Manfrotto products, and I like them all. 
12497 The seams are very visible, and my white backdrop was torn. 
12498 Absolute piece of crap. After the update it won t work anymore. Hugely disappointed! DO NOT BUY! There is no way to contact the manufacturer for a replacement or anything. It s a rip off. Amazon needs to step in and stop these douchebags from selling here. 
12499 Recommended. :) 
12500 works fine 
12501 Great, worth the price 
12502 I like it, good for the price 
12503 A great package! Everything is new, all counted for. The price is awesome for how much accessories you get with the camera. I think this bundle is the lowest priced on Amazon... or any market. On time shipping! 
12504 Great if you want a 40 mm. 
12505 Have been using this for our trip to california,oregon,washington and canada. Couldn t be happier and at such a great price!! 
12506 Love this camera does everything i want, takes great pictures and its pink! 
12507 It works well but have to be right on your idem to bee looked @ 
12508 Worked fine. 
12509 works great 
12510 Best carry on case you can buy... worth every penny. I use this for traveling in the Middle East and R&R carrying my Mac Air, Samsung Tablet 2014 Edition, iPad Air 2, ext. HDD, and charging cables. 
12511 Best drone for the price. Great company and deal with the extra batteries. 
12512 Doesn t allow you to add battery grip, unable to close. 
12513 Camera works great! Only downside is that the box didn t include a manual or memory card. 
12514 Very good item 
12515 Awesome product! 
12516 You can t beat it. It took the place of two lens that I have. 
12517 Great light. Just wish it was AA or AAA instead 
12518 The item showed up 4 days earlier than promised. The item is of high quality and I d recommend it to a friend 
12519 Book I received with it was not in English 
12520 Light weight, very adjustable, great fees tires. 
12521 The work great! 
12522 ok 
12523 small need extra to be studio 
12524 The arm are not very flexible, hard to bend.... 
12525 Not nearly as roomy as I thought it would be. 
12526 Handle with care! First time I mounted it, I got it stuck on my lens. Second time it got stuck in the body of my D7100. I would highly recommend getting a filter wrench at the same time you purchase the ring. 
12527 solid case/great for price 
12528 I can t say enough about this product, it does exactly what I wanted and it sharp corner to corner. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a Ultra-Wide. 
12529 The materials are good and sturdy, the parts fit together nicely, but putting in the rods requires a bit of strength. My recommendation is to put it together and leave it assembled. This one is the perfect size for my purposes. 
12530 Excellent purchase. Very fast shipping. The flash kit comes as described and fitted perfectly on my Nikon D7000. It worked wonderful. I really loved the difusser. 
12531 Falls off camera too easily, already lost this viewfinder 
12532 came with missing screw 
12533 its a decent quality camera for the price. just wish that it would also record so wont have to watch it every so often. the cloud notifications dont fully work, other then this it allows me to see whats going on in my place while im not home. 
12534 Love it its so cute and able to carry any where :) 
12535 Love this lens,. Light, small, and photo quality is awesome,. Using it together with my D7000, takes good sharp photos,. really like it a lot. 
12536 Bought to calibrate laptop screen. Works exactly as it should and it was easy to use. 
12537 ok for the money, but not what i wanted so i returned it for a higher quality and more expensice tripod 
12538 Perfect for keeping all of my photos safe and organized. Love this will purchase again. It actually arrived sooner than I thought it would couldn t be happier with this purchase. 
12539 Great camera using it to film skateboarding with a neewer 37mm fisheye and opteka x grip 
12540 Perfect for what I needed. Great quality. 
12541 taped thru the middle all the way across. folded like an accordion so folds won t come out..can t use as a background. 
12542 Definitely good to have extra batteries when you re out and about. If you re filmong for the day, you don t always have a place to recharge. Fast shipping. Good price. 
12543 Works like original. 
12544 The case is really nice. It s sturdy, well made and comfortable when wearing it. My only complaint is there is no place to put prop guards. I have to carry my prop guards outside of the case. 
12545 Nice, love. 
12546 These are good, they do what they re intended, which is to power an IP security camera, and are not expensive. 
12547 The screw in version installs differently than the bayonet mount (aside from the obvious difference). This video was extremely helpful in getting the latch closed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CsoNmlFZMU Be sure to run your finger over the latch from the attached side rather than trying to just push it in. 
12548 The product was OK. Would not fit my Camera. I think it s the Camera. 
12549 I was looking forward to receiving these but I was disappointed. They were already broken before I could put them on. One of the arms was in a few pieces 
12550 I will probably use the parts to make something different. 
12551 Ok. 
12552 Great case 
12553 Nice and small and works well 
12554 When I used this, it completely drained a newly charged camera battery in 3 hours. Thankfully I own a backup battery. Otherwise it s awesome! 
12555 It wasnt exactly what I had in mind, but was easily adaptable so great! 
12556 I would definitely recommend this product. Good value for money and looks great. 
12557 Amazing gopro piece ! 
12558 This film turned out great! Just keep your exposure to the darkest you can. 
12559 the image quality of the camera was terrible so I returned it... not sure if my camera was defective or generally the 240p sucks! Setting up its wireless connection was so easy and using it whenever there is an outlet was practical. 
12560 Works like a charm... nice clean professional look 
12561 works well 
12562 The size it s very practical, too small. 
12563 Love Canon products... they seem to surpass most other brands with features and performance... 
12564 Amazing very sturdy mount stays in 5 out of 5 
12565 A bit snug for my camera, but it is very nice and it was a great price! 
12566 I love this lens, picture quality is very good. I was unsure about going with a brand other than nikon but glad I did now 
12567 Doesn t work outside USA 
12568 Very fast service. Great to work with. Camera is very nice. 
12569 i ve owned other B+W protective filters and bought this one based on those previous experiences. i m very happy with the quality of images that i m able to capture on a sony a7r. it s like the filter isn t even there. great product. 
12570 good and fast 
12571 The sticker did not fit and fell off right away. Terrible item. Waste of money. 
12572 Got this for my Canon T31 and it works perfectly, also works well on my film camera. Great product and great price! 
12573 They work. A couple have been in use for a few months now without issue. This was a good buy. 
12574 They work great and the picture quality is good. My only complaint which has nothing to do with the camera at all is that they are not cheap to develop. 
12575 Very good ! I love it !!!! 
12576 Works great. Very happy with the purchase. 
12577 Using on my Fujifilm S1 camera. Great price and a product I will recommend. 
12578 I bought these for my Nikon Coolpix L830 and they seemed to do the trick! I am happy with the product, thanks again Amazon! 
12579 Came with chinese firmware and seller only directed me to Dahau. Dahau support is non existent. This camera is actually the lowest end Dahau..I would suggest the 2xxx or 4xxx models over this for a fe more $ 
12580 Great Product 
12581 Everything okey 
12582 Fiddly to set up but it does work. 
12583 Worked out really nice. 
12584 What can I say....it broke 3 minutes into my ride. It was lose so I gave it another turn and it fell apart. Plastic junk. 
12585 what a great kit for a great price 
12586 Flash will not work anymore. Only 1 day after purchase. This thing is bad!!! 
12587 It was nice 
12588 This is a good deal - two batteries, a house charger, and an adapter for the car, all at a good price. 
12589 Worked as expected. Thank you. 
12590 you will not regret spending the high price on this one 
12591 Awesome product and great customer support by POMBO! Quality camera and accessories at a amazing product = satisfied customer 
12592 Perfect for the price every thing works but I have one complain, the screw that holds the position of the suction cup is no holding it, but the other things are perfect!! 
12593 It doesn t zoom well 
12594 Good quality. Great price. 
12595 all the pieces work great with my GoPro HERO! 
12596 Nice 
12597 So far, its been outstanding. Lens is sharp for such as wide range zoom and the noise on he camera is remarkably low at iso 6400. 
12598 met and/or exceeded all expectations 
12599 Difficult to set up but once it is set up correctly, it works like a charm. If your kit weighs more than about 3-4 lbs, this is not the stabilizer for you. 
12600 Love this. Is not auto-focus on Ds3100, but I prefer to use manual. 
12601 Lens caps fit perfect on my Pentax Digital SLR. Package arrived on time! 
12602 Very useable and interchangeables. 
12603 I have this camera. It worked for a few months and I got a few worthwhile images from it. It likes bright sun and works well in the water. The good thing about this camera is the price. 
12604 Excellent camera strap! Very fashionable and useful strap. 
12605 Price was good and its a great battery for the Phantom 1.. 
12606 SONY engineering always seem to make weird design decisions. This time, they removed the IR receiver which has been available in all previous models. So I can flip the LCD screen 180 degree but there is no easy way to trigger the shutter. Brilliant!! 
12607 Too much noise. Any suggestions on how to reduce the noise? (AIR) 
12608 looks good 
12609 It s just a tripod inside a box. The tripod itself is fine, but don t market it as &#34;with a bag&#34; if you re not going to include it. 
12610 Worth the money, filters add more creativity, but are hard to focus with them on. 
12611 I love this camera. Takes good pics and is very user friendly, not a ton of confusing buttons. It s kind of bulky and it s hard to find a case that fits it, but I would say that s the only con. 
12612 Fits the tripod well. Looks k=like it will do the job needed 
12613 Fantastic Little Tripod That Will Grip Almost Anything!!! 
12614 Great filter, spendy but high quality professional. 
12615 not what I expected. 
12616 This battery from Sterlingtek works just as good as the Nikon battery that came with my d7100. Great purchase! 
12617 Great gift item. 
12618 Does what it needs to. 
12619 I ONLY GOT ONE SET, NOT TWO! SO this was a JOKE of a product! 
12620 This item ripped in several places on the first use. The quality was horrible. 
12621 Works perfect on any 50mm lens, bought it for my Canon. Works great! 
12622 Good 
12623 Bad product and bad documentation, it has issues to function. It is surprisingly that a leader brand like Nikon develops a product like this. Another story is the software which is realy poor. I don t recommend it 
12624 This bag was much better than I anticipated! I was originally going to buy myself a different bag! But this one will definitely do the trick! 
12625 works just fine 
12626 Excellent case,rugged and it s Waterproof,just right for a GoPro Camera. 
12627 Excellent quality at a great price. Fit my light perfectly. 
12628 great battery. 
12629 I very much like the camera, but there was no lens cover or instruction Manuel 
12630 Great simple way to carry your lens cap. Stays on tight. 
12631 Film worked as intended, wish it was less cost effective, remember to not shake the photos and to place in the box the film came in to help develop them faster. 
12632 good 
12633 Great mini tripod, what you would expect from Manfrotto, stylish, light, usable and the mobile phone attachment is very easy to use. 
12634 It has a lot of use and think it is really reliable. 
12635 I d highly recommend for ease of use and a balanced posture. If you shoot a lot, this is very handy. 
12636 Just fine 
12637 ok 
12638 Not up to the expectation. Would recommend Nikon COOLPIX S5300 instead of this model. 
12639 Exactly what I wanted. Easy to install. Very flexible to meet differing needs. Used for protection in my separate garage. 
12640 It works 
12641 Definitely not a GoPro 4 Silver, but that is not what is aiming to be. Simpler controls and a more responsive LCD screen make this camera great for beginners and people on a budget. I would highly recommend this over the HERO. 
12642 I really enjoyed the product and the pouch is incredibly handy for stowing safely, however the Polarized lens does not screw in tight. It stays put, but will come off if pressure is applied in the outward direction. 
12643 as expected 
12644 It is so nice to have back up batteries for whatever purpose, so the price and quality of this product was great! 
12645 Easy to use. Sleek. I like the options for uploading pictures. My husband enjoyed his birthday gift. :) 
12646 Great batteries 
12647 Exactly as expected delivery was a bit slow. 
12648 Use is monitor my baby as baby monitor, it works very well. 
12649 Does not make a smooth uninterrupted scan no matter how fast, slow or careful you are with it. You get what you are willing to pay for it, I guess. 
12650 Expensive, but worth the money. Comfortable, well designed, good quality. 
12651 Great câmera. I had some trouble ajusting the flash light when taking pics on a sunny day. But the camera is super fun to use and practical too 
12652 Connected to raspberry pi. Works like a charm. Worked right out of the box. Definitely worth the price. 
12653 Comfortable. 
12654 I am having a blast with this little camera. The photos are small but they are tons of fun. I like the double-exposure feature for creative special effects. (Note-there is trial and error involved in that! But it s fun and works). Great colors in the prints 
12655 Great! 
12656 Love it! 
12657 This camera is mediocre at best. I recommend going to Walmart and buying a canon elph for less. I own a 7d and iPhone 5s. I prefer iPhone 5s over s110 pics. 
12658 Camera take great videos. Came with lots o accessories. Waterproof case works great. Great camera for the price. You can click on the links below to view sample videos.

12659 ok 
12660 Convenient, space saving way to hang multiple backgrounds 
12661 Love it! Great quality at an affordable price. Safely packaged and quick delivery. 
12662 Great camera easy to set up except for the wifi portion which I have yet to figure out. But love being able to spy on my pets at home. Night vision works. I like all the functions of the camera. 
12663 The usb charging port already broke. 
12664 Excellant binoculars ...(and I bought used ones!) 
12665 The color was a little off between materials, but the thing is very usefully and I am happy I bought it. 
12666 Awesome, does so much more than I expected! 
12667 Lens came fast and in perfect condition. Its a quality lens and takes great photos. 
12668 I couldn t get this harness to fit at all. I m female 5 5&#34;. When I adjusted it to the correct length I was unable to raise my binoculars to my eyes.Definately not a product that will work for everyone. Returned without any problems. 
12669 Cool. 
12670 love it 
12671 Good quality. Sturdy.. only problem is blue tooth not compatible with my phone :( other than that, good product. 
12672 The is a great deal and a GREAT drone. Tons of support videos on YouTube. The only manufacturer with a 60 warranty with support in USA. 
12673 Best deal I could find 
12674 No issues with this replacement battery for my Canon elph. Haven t stressed it to much, though; just casual usage. 
12675 Excellent tripod. I ve had it for about 10 years. 
12676 Broke right out of the box. 
12677 Nice 
12678 Saves my lens from scratches 
12679 help some 
12680 Does the does as expected. 
12681 Works well! 
12682 Great batteries. 
12683 New to FPV, if have found the technology to be challenging. But my learning curve has been appreciably accelerated by these folks. They sell great products, backed-up with great documentation and, most importantly, superior after-the-sale support. 
12684 I love this canvas, wish it was bigger. 
12685 Garbage, does not work!! 
12686 Best Price for a solid bundle! Hands down worth it! Thank you for this! 
12687 Nice camera strap it fits well 
12688 Worked fine when I first got it, and now a few months later, I go to record and nothing. No sound. 
12689 This photo studio is large and everything is high quality. May need to add more lights if it s pretty dark but works well for gloomy day product shoots and it gives it the extra light needed. 
12690 Great product 
12691 All the harnesses work great but the hand bar is unstable and always fell over, I had to tape it right side up. Everything else works great! 
12692 Wished it had an auto focus. But other than that, love it. 
12693 Perfect! 
12694 Great product and quick delivery. 
12695 Great item , makes for very nice and interesting camera angles. 
12696 Henry was helpful and patient in assisting me in setting up the camera and on my phone. These cameras are very durable and have good quality for the price. 
12697 Great, very very strong light! I ve said it before and I ll say it again... SATISFIED customer! Love it!! 
12698 So far so good. Only time will tell if this is a product worth more stars. 
12699 For the price and quality it worked just fine. I do recommend any one to get a heavy duty tripod. 
12700 Used these on a recent rafting trip, everything worked great! Selfie stick is as everyone has pointed out... Not great, the weight of the camera in a housing causes it to flip around on you. 
12701 Great set for the price. Didn t come with any explanation as to what lense is used for what purpose. Overall pleased. 
12702 Case Logic DCB-304 
12703 Works as expected, fits my Trek Alpha series just fine. 
12704 Perfect 
12705 Love it! 
12706 Awesome product sent in record time. 
12707 very nice product! nice and clear and does not affect my usage of my go pro. protects my screens well. thanks! 
12708 works as described 
12709 Good product as advertised. Pictures turned out very good and used at Cancun resort. 
12710 Good very good job 
12711 Received it a few days later than expected but no worries! 
12712 Bought this lens for Milky Way astrophotography and was not disappointed. Great lens for the price, so long as you don t mind manual focus. The nikon version comes with the right interface for the camera to control aperture, so all of the auto exposure stuff will work. 
12713 The transparent crystal case fits and goes perfect with my daughter s instax mini 25 hello kitty camera. She loves it and thank you. 
12714 Cut my finger on a shard of steel that was leftover from the machining process on one of the balljoints. But the arm works well, locks into place, and is stable. 
12715 Was perfect for our daughter s wedding photo booth! 
12716 I wanted extra batteries for an upcoming research trip to Mongolia. Sadly, this held an incredibly low charge and was next to useless. Very disappointed. 
12717 lots of mounts 
12718 The only time that is a good thing 
12719 I got this because I m a bit p-noid sometimes...this only made it worse!! I get it and test it out, the signal was going off every where, my tv, my ceiling fan, my cable box and spots in my ceiling I which is probably an electric junction box. 
12720 As advertised, fits the camera like a glove 
12721 Perfect solution to lighting up our pond at night and shutting the lights off from inside our home. 
12722 Works as described! Alerts me on my iPhone of any movement or noise in my home. App allows me to see what s going on from wherever I am. Works day and night. 
12723 BEST SELLER... HOPE TO DEAL WITH YOU AGAIN, 5 STARS FOR SURE 
12724 easy set up - high def only thing is that not enough controlled access when used as a nanny web cam compared to another webcam that i ditched [Belkin], this one never lost connection to the network 
12725 Seem fine and strong, but only time and many uses will really prove these as good product. They are fatter than most of my other Nimh AAs, so they don t fit well in some applications. 
12726 Camera is OK for the price. A little slow on focusing and pictures are not spectacular, but it is a decent enough point-and-shoot for brightly lit scenes. 
12727 Mounts the the bag and does not move at all. Awesome build quality 
12728 My new favorite lens 
12729 great quality mount. holds firm and is easy to setup 
12730 Good looking fake camera. Happy with the purchase, 
12731 Good for this price 
12732 Very nice Case for my camera. Looks sturdy and cool. Would recommend it 
12733 very good 
12734 Fast and Reliable. Will order again soon! 
12735 protects tiny camera 
12736 keeps it floating... 
12737 Works exactly as it should. There s not much to say about it, it s a handle that floats. When dropped into the water it floats as it should. I ve never had problems with the mount either. The strap is comfortable and can tighten on your wrist. 
12738 Henry Campbell helped with the issues with my foscam setup, he finished within 5 minutes, all of their technical support persons have good knowledge 
12739 Very easy to use. AFFORDABLE, STURDY. I have used it many times for off camera flash projects. WOULD BUY AGAIN! 
12740 Prompt delivery. Substantially cheaper than another charger I had priced at a local camera shop. Works perfectly. 
12741 Goood 
12742 excellent product! love it 
12743 Worked great until it died six months later. 
12744 Nice backpack. We ordered multiple of these and like them better than DJI version. But would like the price to match DJI price if we are to order anymore. 
12745 This fit well on my D5300, not a perfect fit but good enough, I think that I should ve taken more care putting it on. 
12746 Just works! No complaints about quality or delivery time. Will be purchasing another. 
12747 Bought as a present for someone who is very pleased as he now can clean all his lenses etc properly. 
12748 Just started using.. Seems a step above the average Chinese replacement battery. The items were well presented with well done packaging. 
12749 Sweet camera for the money and hard-to-find No Infrared option in a bullet. You can use these thru a window or other places you d like discreet surveillance minus the giveaway of infrared bulbs. The included power adapter is a nice touch. I will buy more of these! 
12750 Constantly switches to channel 1 instead of staying on channel you set it on. Also, lots of interferences and loud ringing despite systems being place far apart (different floors). 
12751 Works exactly as advertised as well as very handy. It also is possible to purchase and extension cable to longer remote controlling. 
12752 Exactly what we needed! 
12753 Product is good the battery I ordered was not, the one I had here did fit fine. I had an off brand that did not fit, fits in camera though! 
12754 Camera is great. Could not get the SmartGuard Protection Plan registered. SmartGuard would not take the information. NOT GOOD!!!!!!!!!! 
12755 I wasn t certain that this mount would work with my 3Pod H5 ballhead, but it does. Solidly made, and a great value! 
12756 The die quickly. But you get what you pay. Cheap price=cheap quality. 
12757 Great! 
12758 One of the best lenses made! 
12759 I like this case it works perfect and half the price 
12760 &#34;If you only carry one of these this is the one, extends out longer and remote is keyfob size , i can use with ALL my cameras 
12761 Purchased a 95mm and was impressed so I purchased another UV Filter at 67mm and once again am very pleased with the purchase. Fits perfectly and threads are smooth. Just purchased two more and expect the same excellent quality. 
12762 Matches my nikon d5200 body perfectly. Doesnt add too much weight to the already heavy camera. 
12763 One of my best investments ever. To start on the world of Digital SLR photography, this is it and much more.. 
12764 I may have bought the wrong case as this doesn t fit the stuff very well can t quite get a handle on where stuff is supposed to go. Next time will purchase larger case where I have options on cut outs. May work for you though. 
12765 great 
12766 Still works good after many years. 
12767 love it, but thinking of getting something lighter for my hike... 
12768 Replacement (upgrade) for my Fuji X-E1. 
12769 This item is really unattractive and not functional. Also they charged me $7 to return it??? Terrible. DO NOT BUY! 
12770 heck ya 
12771 Nice and useful set. Quality matches price. Shipping was fast and packaging was fine. Minor scratches on watch stand, but the watch band covers this when it s used. 
12772 Arrived promptly and works as expected 
12773 Decent binoculars for the price. Great size. 
12774 Worth every penny. Loved the videos. More functions that I haven t used yet. Small fits in palm of hand. Great purchase 
12775 I upgraded from the A35 to the A7S and all my Full frame Lens work perfectly on the A-mount to E-mount adapter. 
12776 Much too small to comfortably hold my Canon 70D with a 50mm lens. It fits but you have to stretch like mad. 
12777 Great camera. Easy to use. Takes great pictures. 
12778 love it will be order again sometime soon. 
12779 I like the camera but when using the fisheye lens underwater, water gets between the fisheye and normal camera lens. 
12780 I have already recommend to my friends 
12781 &#34;Very good product. I like.Thank the seller to send a birthday gift Integrity of the seller.&#34; 
12782 good price and product 
12783 This is one of the best. Very durable. Zooming option is nice and clear. I owe one for about 7 years now and have no regrets buying it. Nice piece of equipment. 
12784 This is the only kind of lens cleaning paper I usually order. Always does the job and is not flimsy to use. This product arrived in the time they said it would arrive. I m happy with my purchase. 
12785 Good product, very durable, shipping was EXTREMELY fast... I ordered this case on a Saturday and paid for 2 day shipping and it showed up the day after i ordered it, on a Sunday... I didn t even know I could get deliveries on Sundays haha. Overall very satisfied. 
12786 Replaced a 10 yr old alert that is no longer made. This one is much better - it has volume selection and choice of sound. It works from 1/8 mile from the house. Lpve it. 
12787 We use it as a back door alarm at our senior thrift store. It works great. 
12788 Great, met all of my expectations 
12789 Perfect bag for everyday use, lots of storage potential and places to put different things! 
12790 Really great! The video is so smooth and the glasses are so stylish that I can wear them out and nobody knows what they are. 
12791 It worked great 
12792 This is my additional order. I bought 3 before from different seller. I use it on my off flash n strobes 
12793 Item is what it says it is and arrived as such. Just didn t do much to take out jello. On increasing height I would still get the wobble. Only reason for three stars as it just wasn t what I needed. Item was flawless in description and delivery. 
12794 Tough and easy to use. A great tripod 
12795 Pare soleil efficace 
12796 Great addition to the Orion 4.5 StarBlast, nice wide field of view. 
12797 This was easy to install, works like it was advertised and best of all I can easily view what the cameras are seeing from thousands of miles away. One more plus, it is superior to the wifi cameras in cost and it is hard wired. 
12798 Excellent hi-quality product and seller 
12799 Bought for my 12 year old grandson. He loves using it when he is riding his bike. 
12800 Great quality for a super low price. I use this on my sony action cam for motorcycle riding. It is directional so the wind noise does not affect the mic in my helmet. 
12801 This hood is not worth ordering. It does not securely mount onto my Canon lens, and has fallen off more than a few times. It is only a matter of time before I loose it for good (which at this point I am okay with). 
12802 good 
12803 No comments 
12804 ok 
12805 Lost my power for my camera this one works great 
12806 Nicely built bag that actually protects your camera but I hated how bulky this was. I brought this with me while I was vacationing and it was a pain having to lug this thing around. 
12807 Works great! Have been doing some landscape tripod shots and this remotes is a good product at a good price. 
12808 The lens hood came in an official Sony Box. It fit my lens as advertised. 
12809 I bought these as a gift for my wife and she loves it and its an actually steal... 
12810 Begginer photographer here so I don t know a ton but the product was as described and I m very happy with it. 
12811 Case is a little bulky for putting into a camera case so i can t actually carry it with me but it all works well 
12812 Excellent product Terry Morgan was very helpful! 
12813 When I attached it to my camera it wouldn t focus at all 
12814 i think maybe they lit for one night, then dead, nothing. get them at Home Depot instead. I should of. 
12815 Nice luv it 
12816 Fogged up due to humidity the first time I used it but that was my fault for not setting it out sooner in the outside air. 
12817 Works great! I use to get dizzy when watching my video but now I don t have that issue using the gimbal. A must have. 
12818 The package came as described, the light is very bright and works well for macro photography! 
12819 As soon as I put my flash, the clamp would fall and lost it grip. Not worth the price 
12820 Super hard to get pictures under water as you can t see anything on the screen but it s okay. I got a couple good pics and it s decent price/quality ration. :) 
12821 Pictures are O.K.,but deleting is a pain. 
12822 as described. Thanks! 
12823 Good props 
12824 Awesome product… 
12825 Great Product at a Great Price with fast shipping 
12826 Works well with a Nikon D3200, but autofocus with the Tamron 150-600 lens is hit and miss dependent on the light. At longer zoom settings you will need a tripod, or a lot of light and high shutter speeds, as expected since any movement blurs. 
12827 The product is described as HD / 720p camera. The quality when viewing through the Web app or mobile app while the camera was connected via ethernet, is clearly not HD. We have 2 other cameras on the same network and also 720p which have a much higher quality. 
12828 It works, but it s...big. It bulges over the side a bit more than it seems like it should, creating a lip on the end of my lens. This metal lip makes getting to the lens cap more difficult than it needs to be. 
12829 Purchased this for snorkling in Key West for our Canon Elph. It works great. I m sure it s not nearly as good as an actual underwater camera but for the price this case it s a keeper! 
12830 I mostly use it with a Canon T3i with a nifty-fifty and the 85mm 1.8 and the rest of the space (about half the bag) with things for work...so far I m happy with it. 
12831 has issues ... tilt axis keeps drifting even with a perfectly balanced camera. I ve used the GH4 and Blackmagic cinema and same issue with both cameras. Calling DJI is a joke and gets you NOTHING done. 
12832 I love this tripod, so versatile and well made 
12833 They look a little cheap, but they work perfectly. Strong clamp, good size for what I need. 
12834 does an excellent job of keeping my gopro afloat and it latches on and closes very secure and snugly. great product and was shipped extremely fast! 
12835 Worked perfectly ,good quality, arrived quickly AND inexpensive 
12836 Bulky, heavy, picture quality not impressive. 
12837 Exactly as advertised and works perfectly with Nikon Coopix510 camera. Great price for all that is included. 
12838 Product came as promised and came earlier than expected! Good price too! 
12839 Love this thing!! Super easy to use and takes great videos. 
12840 Very pleased with the camera and especially the price... 
12841 You can literally set up your go-pro anywhere and on anything. This was a great bundle package and super inexpensive. 
12842 Amazing video clarity for the price. 
12843 My daughter loves it came on time it s so cute!! 
12844 Great lens. Works perfectly. Shipped fast. 
12845 great set 
12846 It was as listed. 
12847 Very acurate very easy to use Test xlr 1/4 midi 3/8 rca 
12848 Great product! 
12849 Purchased to mount on a roll bar on an open-cockpit racecar. I have used it for one full day (about 3 hours of track driving including some off-track excursions) and it performed flawlessly, no shaking and never loosened up. It was received quickly and exactly as described. 
12850 Well built mount. It most important part of a mount is the it is solid with no vibration or slippage. This is a great mount. Likely I will order more. The ball joint allows infinite positioning possibilities. The best mount I have. 
12851 This new lens is most versatile lens by Nikon, in my opinion. I have many Nikon lenses over 40 years, and this one is the most convenient for my D700 and D750 in everyday and travel shootings. 
12852 Works like a champ. 
12853 Was exactly as described and came quickly! Very pleased! 
12854 Sucks... i need a serial code that they were supposed to give me to use the software so i can t use it until I get it. 
12855 Great for the price, avoid digital zoom of course. 
12856 Great camera mount. I bought it as a gift for my mountain biking cousin and she loves it. It is very sturdy and solid. 
12857 good value 
12858 Very nice camera. Software not user friendly. Spent hours trying to set camera up. Called tech support, they had problem had to download a fix. Reset camera, then could not log in ... return camera within a week. 
12859 Camera was in excellent condition. 
12860 Worked as advertised 
12861 Excellent product! Great alternative too name brand batteries. Worked great in my Nikon D5000. 
12862 It is a pelican. Need I say more... 
12863 This is s superb tripod! I couldn t be happier! 
12864 Batteries fit in a hero 4 silver without issue and last just as well as the factory. Charger works well. 
12865 must have for people who misplace their cap all the time 
12866 I will recommend this to anybody 
12867 Doesn t hold a charge. Runs down quickly. I get 70 pictures on 50% of the charge. normally I can get 350 pictures on 60% usage 
12868 Currently on vacation and haven t taken the go pro off of this stick. It s durable and perfect for us. Goes underwater, in the sand and even the basic stuff. Great product 
12869 It fitted my camera well. 
12870 all good thanks .. 
12871 Can t speak to the quality of the power output but in the field they last roughly as long as my Canon batteries. 
12872 works goood 
12873 I ve used these for a few months and I really enjoy them. 
12874 Love this HD camera 
12875 fast delivery and low price. 
12876 It can record on SD card and on laptop, recording is easy and automated. 32GB micro SD card holds more than 60 hours of recording and it keeps on recovering.Great camera and great image. 
12877 Strong., easy to use. 
12878 Fabulous. I cannot believe I was able to take such awesome video of the moon. This technology is amazing. I photoshopped my cat on the moon. Thanks so much for a great product! 
12879 Great idea, worked great for about a month then started having all kinds of problems. Would like to see someone build a more durable and reliable unit and charge more for it. 
12880 I wish it was 1080p but I m still happy with it. 
12881 Perfect fit, easy installation. Always a good idea to help preserve the condition of your screen. 
12882 good enough 
12883 More than what we need for taking pictures and for identification of small insects. I shall highly recommend it. 
12884 Too small to comfortably hold Coolpix S33. 
12885 No windows 8 drivers, not compatible 
12886 Arrived swiftly. Battery works great! 
12887 Works great! Can a photographer ever have too many backup batteries and chargers? 
12888 very good purchase. my camera would not work with the old battery that came with the camera. I tried charging it several times but nothing worked. so glad that amazon had these in stock. 
12889 It works! Easy to setup. 
12890 Work like it should. 
12891 Daylight, nightlight, whatever you shoot in, this thing will pick it up. Even in the case, you can still make out low voices talking, and the clarity is astonishingly better than I expected. For the price, you can t beat it. I plan on ordering a few more very soon. 
12892 Cheap, comes with everything you would ever need! Not as strong as GoPro (after 4 weeks a mount broke) The selfie stick (mono pod) tend to rotate a bit, but not to the point where it s unusable. 
12893 Just might be the best lens on the market, at least for headshots anyway. Super sharp, super crisp and the autofocus is amazing. Many complain about its weight, but that makes about as much sense as saying a Ferrari s engine is too loud. Happy shooting, Vroom Vroom. 
12894 good product 
12895 A+++ 
12896 This recharged batteries quickly and I was happy that I received it just as fast before the kids went to camp. 
12897 This is a great little case for the money. Works for me! Nicely made. I would recommend this anyone that doesn t have a case for their camera. Love it! 
12898 Perfect!!! 
12899 Cheap and works good 
12900 Best training quad for the money ! Stable and responsive. Buy extra batteries ! 
12901 Got these to use with my Eco shopping totes. Just the right size and padding is great. 
12902 Works as described and a must have for vacations. 
12903 Does not fit the Canon EFS 18-55 IS. The lens has 3 tabs, the hood only has 2. Returning to Amazon. I don t know how the people that answered questions got it to fit unless they have a different version of the 18-55 from Canon. 
12904 Great bag. Well made. Plenty of room and great compartments.. 
12905 Very good for a reasonable price. 
12906 It was easy to install with Synology Surveillance Station. Excellent image quality. 
12907 too dificult to operate 
12908 Probably will fit Most compact cameras. A MUST BUY! 
12909 These are ok but not great. 
12910 Great lense 
12911 I m glad and I like it! 
12912 Gave this camera to my 12 year old granddaughter and she has loved it! Is putting together picture albums and going thru film like crazy. This is what she picked out for her birthday and she has enjoyed it ever since. Great little product here. 
12913 I have purchased smaller cleaning cloths for my glasses. They were hard to use because they were small. I now only use them when I carry them in my pant pockets. These extra large cloths are AWESOME. No problem cleaning your eye glasses with them. I highly recommend. 
12914 Product does the job, as described. Doesn t scratch screen or glasses. Cleans smudges and fingerprints quickly. Good deal. 
12915 amazing device, smart idea. 
12916 works great with T3i 
12917 the BEST !!!! i want 10 of these !!! takes a contour from dead rto full in 45 less minutes. ALSO takes a GoPro from dead to full in about 40 less minutes. 
12918 Terrific camera with better IQ than A7ii. Easy to shoot hand held which is notable for a high megapixel camera.only negative I can think of is that it is a bit heavier than the A7ii. 
12919 Wow, amazing camera and I m a total rookie when it comes to photography. Easy to use and take clear professional type Photos. Excellent battery life also makes this machine amazing.. Love it, don t hesitate. 
12920 Ive had this for a while now with no problems never thought id find a charger for my fe-20 and i believe it shipped pretty soon 
12921 Great camera. Great price. 
12922 This kit takes out all quest work of gopro accesories, this covers the bases from the case to the tripod.the extra batteries are also very helpful,couldn t ask for more 
12923 Nope didnt like it 
12924 It does exactly what I wanted it to do 
12925 Rock solid. Even at 125 mph! 
12926 Good price for the amount of options! 
12927 My order was for 5 cameras- 3 of them arrived broken beyond repair. Of the 5, zero of them have a functioning light. They are passable as cameras but your odds are low that they ll arrive in usable condition. 
12928 Does the job! Used it for our honeymoon in New Zealand and Fiji. The camera was floating in several scenarios including swimming pools, rivers, and oceans! 
12929 Horrible super cheap made! They should not be selling this item it all I give it zero stars!! Please don t buy this item you will be very disappointed! I promise! 
12930 Easy to use and set up. Great item 
12931 EXCELLENT 
12932 I have to say I saw quite a few mixed reviews. So far the lens is working out fantastic for all the landscape pictures I take and stars!! 
12933 it works and there you go. 
12934 The battery charger is exactly what I needed and it was shipped and delivered on time. 
12935 The item works fine but the housing was dinged up. It looked used. 
12936 Very good quality of pictures and videos, love it!!! Great accessories too, couldn t get better deal for my money. 
12937 Works for light camera bodies/lenses. A bit difficult to hold still when attatch a medium telephoto prime lens with a DSLR. 
12938 Terrific!!!!.... and the delivery was fast 
12939 Exactly what I expected! Arrived on time. 
12940 A+++++ 
12941 Good product. Would buy again. 
12942 I love it 
12943 these are great though we only received three instead of the four indicated. 
12944 Great way to be introduced to the effects among different filters. Gave this to someone who just got a new DSLR and thought they should have some lens protection. Case and filters have good construction feel 
12945 fit perfectly. Included a bonus - ability to tie the lens cap to the neck strap (won t lose it again). 
12946 Received item in good condition. Works with no problem at all. 
12947 Holds my camera with lens and 70-300 mm lens also. Room in pockets for gadgets. Bag resists water. 
12948 Excellent product, video is amazing, fast and quiet, micro SD is an extra for me, software support multiple cameras and multiple windows in same screen. EXCELLENT, this one replace a broken 0.3 PM Foscam and use it with my NAS system. 
12949 Henry from Foscam was great to work. He was able to get my camera so I can view it remotely in a matter of seconds. Great support and great product. 
12950 Can wait to use it for our cruise! 
12951 Screws right into my X-Pro 1 without any hassle and stays there pretty tightly. Looks good with the black and it s pretty lightweight. Plus it s the only soft button I ve had so far that hasn t fallen off! 
12952 Awesome! 
12953 Danny was ERY fast and helpful in the resolution of a probelm 
12954 It did not work. The screen was completely white. 
12955 pleased with purchase. Just as expected. 
12956 its made ok. it absolutely does NOT work with my garmin virb elite even though they put it in the description! guess i got caught with the &#34;keyword&#34; type ad they use to get you on their page even though their product has nothing to do with your shopping needs. 
12957 Great quality, won t pick up trees if windy. Easy to set up, 5 minutes, batteries after three weeks, still full. Recommend if your looking for a nice security camera. 
12958 Very useful one. Shipping was fast. 
12959 This tripod is perfect for the price! Easy to use, great size and worth it. Product came in perfect, all parts work! 
12960 Great lens at the best price anywhere. 
12961 Nice kit wish there was a small thin piece of metal to protect the set screw from bezel damage but I Mac Gyvered a shim to do the job works great. 
12962 Holy crap this is AWESOME!!! Im telling ALL my photog friends. 
12963 Fantastic lens. Very sharp. 
12964 Fantastic!!!! 
12965 The bottom does not work. Just de remote control 
12966 Great product! 
12967 Daughter is happy she bought a camera could not find the battery I DID GOT TODAY. SHE IS ON CLOUD 9 THANKS 
12968 Great products delivered quickly. 
12969 ExFoto body and rear lens cap fit just right on the Sony A3000 (&#34;Sony&#34; and &#34;E Mount&#34; are stamped on both). Handy when using adapters. Product arrived in about two days...great service. I recommend this, no problems. 
12970 Works great with my utility PG&E! 
12971 All my gear fits well. Nice fit and finish. Good product 
12972 Price beat out the competition and product was as advertised. 
12973 My go-to glass when I tie smaller than size 14 flies. Nice warm light. 
12974 Great product... Used it and works magnificently. Reduced the amount of gear I sometimes travel with. Loving it. 
12975 Great to have. Never know when will be needed. 
12976 It feels pretty cheap. One came damaged but they sent a replacement. You have to be extremely delicate when adjusting camera if not you can mess up the threading in the screws. 
12977 I bought this unit when I purchased a new video camera. They work flawlessly. 
12978 It has better resolution than the previous generation, but did not include any software for viewing multiple cameras, as in the past. 
12979 Macro lens is crap. I used wide angle lens only once and don t like to use anymore 
12980 Took a while to ship but it s exactly as described. 
12981 Does what it says 
12982 Amazingly thought and easy to apply. Great product! 
12983 Material is very sturdy, with very tight connections. 
12984 Love it, motion detector work amazing!!! wifi, free cloud! easy to use. Glad I got this! I use this in my room when I leave, I just plug it in when I leave and unplug when I get home. 
12985 Love it. Bought this as a gift for a friend and you can clearly see the difference in the pictures. Would recommend this and the price is right. 
12986 We bought this when we had a baby. Takes amazing portrait photos at a reasonable cost. 
12987 Came in the mail fast. I only use my polaroid for special occasions and if you do the same, then I wouldn t suggest buying such a large packet because these expire and photos don t come out as great. This is a great deal though. 
12988 These work great. Not one problem 
12989 It is a very nice bracket. This is the only item that I have ordered from Foscam that I haven t had to send back for replacement. 
12990 Suitable quality for the price. Met description and accurately performs on my daughter`s iPhone 5S. Would recommend purchase to others. 
12991 My bouancy mount just crumbled in my hands after less than a month of light use. What gives? This is after the screw for one of the mounts disappearing in the ocean. I m dumbfounded. 
12992 Outstanding value for the price. You get 2 Vivitar batteries for the price of 1 and the charger and cleaning kit. Vivitar has made quality photography equipment for decades. 
12993 Wonderful toy, if it just worked how it supposed to. It doesn t matter how much i correct or &#34;calibrate&#34; it with the correction buttons in the remote, it just keep going front or aside, i almost lost it to the ocean 2 times!!! 
12994 This mount was slim enough to allow proper focusing on all my cctv lenses. It does what it advertises well. 
12995 Not sure have not got it to work yet. I will repost later. 
12996 As advertised and good price 
12997 Love the versatility with the 5 different colors and hues. Easily folds down (once you ve practiced a few times lol). 
12998 very good camera, but very temperamental. One should double check shots before relying on the evf focus or otherwise. 
12999 I use these Filmguard bags to keep my cellphone in when I travel. While the chances of damage are remote, these bags are used to protect some of my electronic devices. 
13000 Fits my old Cannon Eos RebelG yeah thats a 35mm. 
13001 So far, so good. 
13002 Perfect...!!! 
13003 Repeat customer. Shipped fast, great product. Chargers my Canon rebel camera just as well as the original battey! Thx! 
13004 As described. Quick ship. 
13005 Perfect! 
13006 It s a wonderful product. the night and day vision is very clear. Had no problems installing although had to ask for help with putting it in the right spot. We be ordering more of this item 
13007 Works great. Best one I ve used in this type of head 
13008 Does not record video from my quad copter cam. 
13009 awesome yo. 
13010 arrived fast easy to install 
13011 Easy to use, great price. 
13012 Perfect fit for my Sony camera. 
13013 Great camera, everything works great and the international delivery service was quite fast. Tnx for a good deal. 
13014 This camera takes great pics in and out of water. We took it on vacation to Punta Cana and were very pleased with the quality of the pictures. 
13015 Very happy with the kit. 
13016 I like the dual settings and it fits perfectly on your strap. 
13017 AAAA++++ 
13018 Great price to give as a gift to a young graduate. 
13019 I love this camera. Great pictures and options. Can use AA batteries instead of having to keep it charged. The wireless share option is absolutely awesome - it instantly will send them to my phone or tablet for sharing and uploading. No cords to worry about. 
13020 They thought of everything, most complete kit I have ever seen, amazing product. Very useful. 
13021 Seemed to work well for calibration, but started bugging me to recalibrate about two weeks later and I can t get it to stop. 
13022 not working great. hard to set up. returned and bought other camera 
13023 good 
13024 Not made strong 
13025 Works well as a replacement for a storage card reader. 
13026 Sorta big but it works 
13027 Great Item! Would buy again. Did not disappoint. 
13028 Tons of space, extremely comfortable, great value. Looks and feels like it should cost a lot more than it did. It has so much space, I don t even have enough stuff to put in there :) 
13029 Well built, smooth action, no faults so far. This head is more useful to me than a ball head. Handle is on the left side, right hand is free to hit shutter or change settings 
13030 Rhis was amazing! Way better than i expected. Durable vinyl. Greaaaaat color. Loved it and will use it for many years to come 
13031 So many different levels it can be placed on. Great tool 
13032 Great addition to my amateur photography case. 
13033 Cumbersome, not useful. 
13034 Don t try to tighten these suckers even slightly with your fingers! I did. And there was no way I could untighten them by hand! The lens binds! I actually had to take a pair of waterpump pliers to the filter to get it off. Just saying! 
13035 Whats to say? It works. 
13036 nice product, quick delivered, good description 
13037 They fit the screen of my a5100 perfectly. 
13038 Excellent product! Used it on MacBooks, Acer s, Lenovos. Makes all the difference in the world when running. On the MacBook, the fans don t turn on as soon as they would before, and it definitely runs cooler. 
13039 It is okay little too heavy but not try to look at the moon yet 
13040 Wait until next trip to Asia. 
13041 Good, sturdy little tripod for the right application. Just keep in mind the size, and if it fits your needs, you ll like it. 
13042 Works perfectly with the strap. 
13043 Finally a cup that stays on in my bag. 
13044 Fast service! Love the product! 
13045 I wish the directions were a little clearer on how you know when it is fully charged and when its on verses off. 
13046 Seems to work pretty well, a bit faster than in camera charging. It does get a bit warm, but that hasn t been a problem so far. The batteries seem to hold a charge about the same as the Sony branded options, time will tell if they last as long. 
13047 Got as birthday gift for wife, and she loves it. Pictures are beautiful and it brings back the nostalgia of the insta pic camera. 
13048 according to expectations, very good article 
13049 A must have for action sports! 
13050 It has a pretty decent quality, great camera to take on a short trip, hiking or biking. No complaints. My only complaint is that it does not come with a memory card. The price is right and the quality is better than I expected. 
13051 The Lefun video camera was very difficult to activate to my IPhone but upon getting it done, it is a fantastic device. It met all expectations and was a great addition to the overall security of my residence. I am very pleased. 
13052 love it!! 
13053 Just what I needed and a price that I was very happy with 
13054 Very pleased with the camera and it s features from night vision to mobile device notification. I recommend this camera to anyone that is looking for a good security camera. 
13055 Great deal! 
13056 This bag is so cute!! High quality, perfectly fits the Fuji. Sturdy also! 
13057 Charged up fine and works well. 
13058 Fits on my T5i 
13059 It is good product. I spend a lot of time to find it. 
13060 Screws keeps coming loose and the Gopro adapter correctly. Otherwise it is ok for a starter clamp. 
13061 Amazing camera delivered quickly. 
13062 Awesome and cheap! Good thing i found this 
13063 Exactly what I was looking for for my GoPro!! Highly satisfied!!!! 
13064 This case is great! Fit everything I needed in it. 
13065 Works great. Just wish it had an off switch. 
13066 very nice 
13067 Product delivery and performance as advertised. Would recommend to friend. 
13068 Received in great condition. Packaged appropriately. Charged just fine. But have not been able to use as both camera shipments arrived damaged and were returned. 
13069 Can you use this for fishing in a boat? 
13070 very satisfied fast delivery would recommend ,charges fast 
13071 Love this cam and use it as a dash cam every day. 
13072 Was good till it rained. Camera maybe outdoor but not the poe connection. 
13073 The quality of picture is poor at best 
13074 Cool 
13075 AWFUL! Save your money. The software wouldn t download, making it completely useless. 
13076 A+++++ 
13077 great floats to save my electronics. I had 1 from before and had to order this set of 2 because they are so great. 
13078 Great quality for good price! Came really fast even though i chose free shipping! 
13079 Received product and tried installing it myself. Had a problem with the play back 
13080 Called D-Link customer service and received excellent assistance from Employee id# AR004619 
13081 Didn t like the way the vivitar lens hood fit so I got a genuine cannon lens hood 
13082 Great lens for my Canon t3i, price was right. I like it! 
13083 Haven t lost a camera yet. 
13084 Best camera in the world!!!!!!!!!!!)))))) 
13085 This is a great product. See the video about it on the B&H site. 
13086 Good product and fast delivery. Just as expected. 
13087 Nice Camera and not complicated to operate. 
13088 Not bad at all. The Sony battery I m using can be a pain to pull out, but besides that, the light wouks great and can be VERY bright. 
13089 Great purchase, very usable for the batteries of our Panasonic Camera. 
13090 Looks very realistic, good quality and arrived on time. 
13091 Well, there is a ton of stuff in this kit. I hope my wife figures out what all of it is for. Super fast service, all packaged real well. Exactly as advertised. 
13092 Camera take great videos. Came with lots o accessories. Waterproof case works great. Great camera for the price. You can click on the links below to view sample videos. Sample Video @ 1080p/60fps daytime: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpDS_aVjA5Q https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZ4A19GoEFk Sample Video @ 1080p/60fps at night https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UQICoPTPlw 
13093 the lenses are great, though I rarely use the 15mm the filters are amazing!! you can even use the blue filter on the moon and the resulting image will not be too affected color-wise, where are if you use the moon filter you get a green moon. 
13094 I am very happy with it s calibration results, but the software is OK. Calibration takes a while, and the software could be a bit more powerful. I bought this hoping that I could accurately change color temperature throughout the day, but it s not an easy process. 
13095 The light is dim, but good enough to provide a little light to highlight our front columns. 
13096 Great Product just what I was looking for. Easy to set up. I also like the fact I can receive photos on my cell. 
13097 Arrived on time. Exactly as expected. 
13098 I am having a lot of fun getting to know my new camera. It takes incredible pictures. I only wish I could go on vacation to all the scenic places to take pictures. 
13099 It s fun. Make sure lighting is good when you take pic. If they are pics will be nice. Took it to a wedding. Fun. I give it 4.5 stars 
13100 Great I Love It 
13101 POOR DEPTH OF FIELD. PICTURES WERE NOT SHARP. OVERALL HAD BETTER PICS WITH LOWER PRICED CAMERS, ESPECIALLY NIKONS AND THE KINDLE FIRE HD. 
13102 Such a great price!! You would be crazy not to buy!!! Just got it in the mail today and everything is perfect!! I can t put my camera down! I have a Nikon d7100 and the auto focus with the lens works wonderfully! Thank youuuuuu! :) 
13103 Convenient and fits perfectly. Quality plastic cases for photo batteries. 
13104 very niice 
13105 This is a really nice camera strap. I replaced my Nikon strap with this one and have not had any neck ache from the strap cutting into the back of my neck. Good material, nice looking and easy to detach from camera. 
13106 Came with everything stated and in great shape. A really good value given the price. 
13107 very useful item! everything was ok, recommended! 
13108 Rough machining; not smooth when adjusting. 
13109 My camera stopped working the minute I plugged this in!!!! 
13110 They look real! Installed all 4 in 30 minutes. My handyman saw them and said, &#34;Good for you, you have a security system.&#34; I did tell him the truth😊 
13111 Spend the money on this and you will be glad you did. Works awesome, stinks really well without damaging. 
13112 Good 
13113 not good at all 
13114 Original and perfect! 
13115 Easy, fast, safe and confortable! 
13116 The item works as advertised. The only downside I have found so far is it does not fit as well as the original lens cap did. It does, however, fit well enough to keep dirt, water, etc off of the lens. 
13117 I wondered if I would like this since it is an off-brand, but so far the batteries last just as long as my Fuji batteries, so I have no complaints. Good price on a good product! 
13118 Batteries work fine in my Canon Powershot Elph 520HS. Received in a timely manner. Thank you! AAA+++ 
13119 ALL WENT WELL 
13120 Delivered quickly, quality product. Easy to use. Thanks! 
13121 I ve been able to calibrate all of my lenses with ease. 
13122 Awesome, Beautiful piece 
13123 Great buy, very happy. Easy set up 
13124 Worked to perfection. 
13125 The only reason I m not giving this a 5 star rating is the cheaply-constructed plastic ring adapter that comes with it. 
13126 Works great 
13127 Works great. 
13128 Ok 
13129 Awesome 
13130 I needed to file down the base that slips into the camera s hot shoe so it fit better (the paint made it just a bit too big to easily fit), otherwise it works great! I highly recommend this adaptor for devices like Sony s HDR-AZ1. 
13131 This works if it is trying to hold up just the camera. If you have any other accessories on it though, it doesn t seem to work so well. The bright orange does help find it in the water though. 
13132 Looks very realistic and if you can keep it in the sun the charging works well. 
13133 the pics of my husband in tis think was worth every cent 
13134 it is a very good polarizer at a good price. Recommended 
13135 Just like the ones that came with my Go Pro. 
13136 Fast shipping and quality product. 
13137 Great camera! 
13138 I didn t know how much I wanted this tripod until I used it ..fantastic! DSLR no problem. 
13139 Good. 
13140 Fast shipping, product work s as advertised. Great value I highly recommend! 
13141 very good picture 
13142 Worked fine 
13143 AS usual, a great filter. 
13144 Works, but be sure to rinse thoroughly after saltwater use as it uses cheap screws which will rust in no time. 
13145 Nice case 
13146 Product works fine (my second set). Inexpensive &#34;fix&#34; 
13147 If you are going to get serious about using your GoPro, the higher end filter solutions will be better for you, but these do work as described, though short lived if handled often. 
13148 The fit is so far off the batter fails to make contact when this device is screwed onto the A6000 
13149 Great for getting those difficult angles. 
13150 keeps charge almost the same as original and price is awesome. will see how long will keep capacity. will buy it again. 
13151 None of the pictures develop , I went to Michael s and bought more film to see if it was my camera ,but all the film from Micheal s worked. None of these developed. 
13152 Super fast charger and two batteries for less than the price of the batteries. Amazing. 
13153 Using these batteries with my FujiFilm X100T camera as extra backups - they work like a charm, seem to be well made, charge reasonably fast, no issues with size. 
13154 Nice product. Will order one more right now. Great for dslr attachement and slider set up. 5stars Please check out our youtube channel PassionForDrive 
13155 Other than lockjaw because the weight of the camera I can t complain. Steve has great customer service and will take care of you if there is an issue. I highly recommend for those that want first person view while surfing! 
13156 Takes great pictures, easy to use. Great for telephoto shots. Have taken it 4 wheeling and no problem with camera being bounced around. 
13157 worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks. 
13158 Both units arrived DOA. No functions worked, not even flash test. Tried several Nikon flashes - all the same. Best thinks I can say is that I got a prompt no hassle refund. 
13159 Well made, excellent size. 
13160 very pleased 
13161 Used a light meter, this doesn t put out nearly as much as it claims too. False advertisement. 
13162 Works fine. 
13163 For the price, you can t beat this ball head with a stick! I own two of them. 
13164 great! 
13165 Have 0 complaints for the price. Mostly plastic with main bars, etc being aluminum. but again, it does what it s designed to do and is a very solid product. 
13166 This does not fit a Nikon P500 even though it s listed. 
13167 Item delivered on time, was as described, 
13168 Very Good!!!!♡♡♡♡ 
13169 Works perfectly! 
13170 They fit and do the job, although they seem to have less capacity than the Fuji batteries. On the plus side, the included charger is much more compact than the one that came with the camera. 
13171 I use this tripod in my studio and on location. Holds the 7-200L with ease. Love the grips for control. Buy it 
13172 For the price this is an excellent home camera. The ease of which it sets up is what I particularly like about the product. I would recommend this to a friend. 
13173 I love it. it works wonderfully with my Canon 5D MK3. Heavy duty construction. 4 stars because I think it s overpriced. Should be a $29.99 item. 
13174 Arrived quickly. Surprisingly good for moon and star gazing! 
13175 does not contain the circlip, not be able to repair ,the image does not correspond to the product 
13176 This is a very low cost solution for document camera needs. We use this in a school setting. It is very easy to store and to share among several teachers because the set up is so easy. 
13177 Great camera but very slow in reporting, sometimes none at all 
13178 perfect 
13179 Still have not used, but looks good 
13180 Great camera. The fact that you can control it with your phone is amazing. It s just the quality of the image that is a bit disaponting. But other than that it s a great camera 
13181 It floats! I took this on vacation and it worked great to store my cash in, clip it to my bathing suit or whatever! Very good quality! 
13182 Works great easy set except I can t get internet connection to the Internet no usb connect screen reads. 
13183 It was a plastic globe with purposely large drilled holes all around the base of it but packaged in a profoto box. Didn t seem legit. 
13184 Good kit, these accessories are just like the go pro ones, the only difference is they are lacking the name, and thankfully the elevated price tag. Good Stuff! 
13185 I have tried everything under the sun to clean my lcd/led tvs. This stuff is amazing!!! I will be purchasing another bottle as a back up!! 
13186 The lens protector is a must with this frame when not in use. The frame bends easily to get the camera in and out. 
13187 Works perfectly with the lens specified. Good deal. 
13188 These along with the ones that are 90 degrees lets you make any angle you can imagine. They do fit tight and hold well. 
13189 Great product. Effortless to do business with 
13190 Everything I hoped for!! Excellent pictures!! 
13191 Good product. 
13192 Photo quality a little less than anticipated. However, great value. Easy to configure. Has worked flawlessly. 
13193 Works wonderfully. 
13194 This product was easy to use and the pictures looked nice. You can put hundreds of pictures on this device with an 8gb card. There are many options for display and will play music as well. I plan on buying another for myself! 
13195 Works perfectly and for much less than the Panasonic version.. 
13196 This product is strong, but the shoulder pad constantly slides out of position. 
13197 No performance issues.....this link process my photos directly to my computer without any issues. 
13198 Very nice album for the price. I wanted this to put all my daughter s senior proofs in and this album more than met my expectations 
13199 Great screen protector! Must have for D750. Fits perfectly. 
13200 Charges fast. Charger was my main interest as I had buggerred up the charger input on the camera and the batteries were a bonus. 
13201 Amazing! Love it! 
13202 Good 
13203 Worth the price 
13204 Great case. 
13205 Very good 
13206 Not good at all! Never had Wi-Fi , you suck! 
13207 Original equipment that fits like it should! 
13208 Bought this for my daughter who was going on a cruise. She loves this camera and found it easy to use. 
13209 Excellent 
13210 Kept my camera dry during a rained out wedding. It was a total lifesaver. Worth the very low price I paid to keep my very high priced camera safe. 
13211 Awesome item for the graphic artist or others wanting to showcase materials in a clean and professional manner - many extra pages that other portfolios don t have at a great price! 
13212 It came with a ton of stuff. Something you deffenitly have to mess around with and get used to. Ober all very good product and it shipped fast. 
13213 every thing ok 
13214 Great bag, just the right size. Excellent value. 
13215 The very refined product fits my monopod perfectly. 
13216 This product freaking sucks! We have now had it for two and a half months, and it just QUIT WORKING! And Amazon won t let me return it, I am pissed! 
13217 Powers my 7&#34; Lilliput monitor from my RED Brick. Works great. 
13218 This serves the intended purpose- blocking excess light so that I can better see the viewfinder display. It does, however, block some of the rear screen. Debating about trimming it a bit. 
13219 really good camcorder 
13220 A little bit small 
13221 Much sturdier than the cable that initially came with the camera! 
13222 takes good pictures 
13223 Poor connection that requires the camera to be turned on before the lens is seated. This is too expensive for the build quality. 
13224 good to have a spare 
13225 Wanted wireless one. So returned this one. Got to order a wireless one. 
13226 Ths is a very well-made camera. The metal housing is lightweight yet very sturdy. The finish on the base metal is very nice and high quality.The color and contrast on this camera is very good. I would buy another one if the need arises. 
13227 Very dorobale 
13228 fast shipping, awesome price! 
13229 works great in my camera 
13230 Excellent camcorder, I have really enjoy to film with. Very stable image and clear sound. If you are looking for a good camera at perfect price, this is the one for you! 
13231 i love my new camera strap its so pretty and really nice fabric defiantly 5 stars 
13232 Nice, but loosens up in the water and came off during scuba dive. 
13233 Battery would hold enough charge to power the camera for 3 minutes. From first charge, this new battery would not hold a charge. Warning! Avoid! Pour quality. 
13234 Second-rate optics in a nice compact and light binocular. Lost it and bought a Pentax 9 X 28 for $180. Really nice. 
13235 Paper is good quality and color. Thickness was enough to hold up to taping and walking on. The pictures we took against this look fantastic! I highly recommend buying. 
13236 I put these on every lens I own, it protects your lens and with not really much of a reduction in picture quality. Worth the investment better to replace a filter then lens. 
13237 They fit just fine! 
13238 Junk! waste of time and money! Don t buy it! 
13239 Great quality. Perfect amount of storage. Take it on all my hikes. Rugged, did I mention QUALITY. 
13240 This is a really collection of things for my camera. It more than met my needs. 
13241 Adapter was shipped very quickly. I like it better than another PC hot shoe adapter that I used to use. TTL pass through works great and is not obstructed by the hot shoe. 
13242 Perfect 
13243 worked just fine 
13244 good quality 
13245 bad 
13246 I purchased the older model a few years back and it worked great! The new model works but is fuzzy and hangs on shutdown! I would not recommend. Instead of getting better it is far worse! If you can get dvu104 it works very well! 
13247 perfect spare batteries for the go pro, includes charger 
13248 Other than it breaking 2 days after getting it, it s great. I wish I could leave negative stars. Biggest piece of crap. Poorly made. 
13249 Minor hiccup at first when updating firmware for the first time, but once that s complete you won t regret. 
13250 I found the matching tripod for this piece at a Goodwill for $10 but it didn t have the quick release. This piece fits perfectly and it is very easy to remove and out back on the tripod. I m very happy with it. 
13251 Not really practical for shirt pocket, but picture is decent and battery life is as advertised. 
13252 It works great, takes awesome picutres and is very easy to get to record when mounted. However, the user interface with the phone app is really not intuitive and sometimes 
13253 Finding harnesses and acessories are harder than other more popular cameras. 
13254 It s perfect I am very pleased with it. 
13255 I got the incorrect brand for my camera, loot at the details first before you purchase it. 
13256 Battery discharges extremely fast and overheats the camera causing it to shut down way to easily. 
13257 A little pricey but does what it is supposed to. 
13258 Just what I wanted and a good price. 
13259 Exact fit. Long life. Travel charger great to have on a long vacation. Never had to worry about a dead battery at the beach or at the wedding. Charging in the car is a great feature. 
13260 I bought two. Neither worked with motion video. Single pictures worked fine. Continuous video worked fine. 
13261 for being a off brand/knock off it holds really well against the true gopro battery. love that it s a wall charger and can double as a car charger too. 
13262 I ve used these for a couple of years- they take and hold charges well, and I ve changed them about every 2 years. 
13263 If you have a GoPro, just get this. Great price with a greet charger and you ll need the batteries. 
13264 Thourghly enjoing this lense 
13265 So far so good. Everything was there and more than I will probably ever need 
13266 Performed as expected. Still have not used all the accessories. Update. The headstrap works great better than the GoPro model for me.Have not used all the accessories, only those related to diving at present. 
13267 Seals well but buttons very hard to push, unlike original. would not buy again 
13268 It s okay should have done more homework before purchase. Do not like paddle flipping to one side. I find it difficult following anything I want to capture with paddle to one side. Just okay. Thank you 
13269 I have no experience with a proper wide angle lens but this one was a fantastic low budget solution to my dilemma 
13270 it did work for alittle bit,,you get what u pay for..lol 
13271 Love it. Bought two. May get a third. Can check on my elderly dog during the day. 
13272 Great for the lake and other dirty/dusty/wet locations. We have dropped it in the water several times with no negative results. Great for candid shots. 
13273 Sent this as a gift and the recipient loves it!! If has everything needed for a person who is traveling and hates to carry bulky accessories. 
13274 I wouldn t recommend buying this, the tripod is plastic, and one of the legs broke! Not very sturdy and it came to me all scratched up and rusty! 
13275 As advertised 
13276 Got the Sidekick Black Duo. Powerful light that attaches to the gopro via a long screw that holds at the pivot point. Great accessory. It s a bit too bright for close up but it does light up subject nicely overall. Great product. 
13277 Very useful 
13278 A great camera for the price. Wifi Picture downloads is very convenient, All user friendly controls and video quality is excellent. 
13279 its a X mass gift so have not used but looks like its a nice item ...... 
13280 Such a great camera for only $45. It does the job as expected. Super clear video quality and great night vision. Highly recommend it. 
13281 For the money.....excellent. I have high dollar lenses, and this glass performs as expected and exceeds expectations. Really fun to use. 
13282 Great item 
13283 Works ok. 
13284 My mom loves this bag, great size! 
13285 EXCELENT PRODUCT CLEAR VIEW 
13286 way too cool 
13287 Two thumb up 
13288 For a beginner you will be on overload with all the accessories. My daughter has a similar camera, she is helping teach me. Everything but, large tripod fits in case, but, full! I use another bag to carry my camera, most times. 
13289 Good 
13290 I am very happy with this lens. Did not have any kind of problem. Nice Bokeh in my pictures. I have been using with TC 1.4 
13291 So far so good. Great pictures. Thanks for a great product. 
13292 It works, but charger is a pain. It is an adjustable , universal charger. You will have to look up the positive and negative contact with the battery manufacturer (there are many contacts on these batteries!) just to see how to setup the charger. 
13293 Great bag, just needs a little more room. 
13294 Didn t fit. Didn t work. Didn t charge. 
13295 Oh how it makes me feel young again. The Polaroid, which instantly develops and prints out your photo within 15 minutes. I love using it but why it gotta be so expensive to get the film :( Can t mess up with this camera! :) Great quality, LOVE IT! 
13296 Great value. It works as advertised. Only thing that has me worried is how tight the included mount squeezes my iPhone 6 Plus. I may buy a different phone mount, but even doing so this is still a great value. 
13297 Excellent quality and easy to use! 
13298 Very comfy and secure strap. Well worth the purchase. 
13299 Great product and arrived on time 
13300 Fits my camer like a glove. 
13301 I took this home & attached to my camera & works great. What a find. My 200mm didn t go as far as I wanted, for our trips. VR works great as well. 
13302 The batteries are great, but the grip doesn t seat correctly. I loose power to the camera and have to reconnect the grip to get it to work. 
13303 Great camera easy to use. Beautiful 
13304 Construction/materials seems kind of cheap. I d pay more for something a little sturdier. 
13305 The item itself is really nice, it fit my crossshot strap well but the 2 is too small for my galaxy S5, It is good quality enought that I will order the Joey 3 since this wasn t useful for what I needed 
13306 does what is says 
13307 Basic film. Always good 
13308 Love this camera, makes cute business card size pictures. 
13309 Great Kit 
13310 Luv it. 
13311 Then Vivitar Auto Focus teleconverter lens would not operate on auto focus. I had to manually focus to obtain an image. I m very displeased with this purchase and when I return home later this week I will be requesting another one that works. 
13312 Lots of pictures of my hand due to lens placement. Underwater worked and underwater color was good. 
13313 Great little monitor, works really well with my A7S and the smallhd support team has been amazing! The 1080p panel has super high resolution which makes it simple to pull focus. 
13314 The product do not work well. First the stop sign I thought would have been a little bigger. And it want light up when the car touch the pole. It will light up way seconds later. I really not satisfied with the product. 
13315 THIS CAMERA IS GREAT. AND THANKS FOR THE REVIEWER S DISCOUNT. 
13316 this lens will change the way you see photography. It s pricey, but the quality come with a price. If you have the money please buy it. 
13317 Great battery at an affordable price 
13318 It was as advertised and arrived in good time. 
13319 Worthwhile if you find a bargain. Batteries hold up well. Motion sensors delay causes people to be out of the frame before recording. About a 1-2 sec delay. Numerous false alarms and yet has hard time recognizing people in vicinity. 
13320 Great Product, Fast shipping 
13321 This product works however you gotta watch the pin to make sure it doesn t come out. By pin I m talking about when you will see that I m pointing towards in the product picture. 
13322 Great camera! Worth it. 
13323 This product is awesome. I love it 
13324 It didn t fit my light setup but with a little modifying it worked out. Fun product. 
13325 Had to read the reviews to find out how it attached, but it works great. I don t ever remember owning a lens that required the removal of a piece of trim to attach a hood. 
13326 Great product.Would buy again. Expensive but worth it. Well built. 
13327 Arrival time as said 
13328 Going to have so much fun for my birthday &#60;3 
13329 Every positive review is spot on! Love this thing! 
13330 still working 
13331 I m completely happy with the product. 
13332 Awesome 
13333 Great camera fast delivery very happy 
13334 I asked for the Kodak MD863 charging cord and adaptewr but was send one that did fit the charging plug on the camera. I hope we can resolved. 
13335 Horrible. I didnt even get a chance to get it wet. Thr screen stopped working and the battery died within 15 minutes. Now i have no pics of my event 
13336 Henry was very helpful getting my camera set up, foscam underestimates wait times on the phone but that is IT for you. An hour later I cannot connect to my camera, it says incorrect username/password 
13337 Battery Door does not fit properly. Adding tape to hold in place. Must snap door on and add tape each time battery is removed. 
13338 works great 
13339 Well pachaged and arrived very quickly. They charged up well and seem to be working just fine 
13340 I bought this for my Tamron AF18-270mm f/3.5-6.3 lens. Primary purpose is to use it as a protection to the front element of the lens. Very pleased with the quick shipment. 
13341 Neither great nor bad. Mounting hardware is cheap and flimsy. Camera works okay. 
13342 Great quality! 
13343 This bag has worked beautifully for our needs! 
13344 Delivered as indicated and works well on my camera. Great value. 
13345 Perfect! 
13346 great tool for knowing who s comming in your house. 
13347 Fits my Canon 85mm well. Attaches and detatches easily. Fast and efficient service and great item for a great deal. Thank you. 
13348 It was weak and break easy 
13349 Was NOT the color I ordered. I wanted raspberry, received a very dull, red camera instead. Very disappointed 
13350 Not bad. You probably don t want this if you take it places as it ll get banged up quick. But fine for a stable studio environment, and fine for the price. 
13351 Great item, good price!! I really liked the product! 
13352 Good system, easy to set up, works good, does good in the dark 
13353 Took a long time to get them but they are exactly what I wanted! 
13354 Amazing bundle! Great kit for the money. 
13355 It s amazing...as far as a 1000 m range when used as a momentary switch, the relay can chatter at 3 m if you stand between the devices. 
13356 Despite so many half assed reviews that sorta bash this camera, I found that it is leaps and bounds better than the original 7d that my neighbor has. The extra features are worth the extra money to spend on the mark 2 
13357 Grainy video. Can t see the difference between this and my old standard definition camera. I regret buying it. 
13358 Amazing system and easy to install! The camera views from the phone are real clear! You get plenty of cameras to place throughout the house. 
13359 Not much to talk about, it is ridiculously easy to install and sounds pretty good. 
13360 A battery is a battery, what more can be said. The ordering process was simple and it arrived on time. And I did order a second one. 
13361 Records really dope but Idk if it s my phone or the camera. But when i download the video too my phone I have no sound. 
13362 Case is soft not a hard case..price is right 
13363 Works great. Charges two batteries relatively quickly. Glad I bought it. 
13364 great accessory to have for the GoPro. really cool to see the point of view of your dog. adjustable for dog sizes 
13365 Used to replace Honda Accord original alarm horn. Works great. 
13366 Didn t fit. 
13367 Moose always delivers. Love this circular polarizer. It is my second size and every time I get a lens, I will return to get one in the new size needed. 
13368 bought this for my wife as a birthday gift as she was getting ready for a mission trip to Monterrey. Not only is it a good camera but as a tablet she used it to keep me informed of her trip via e-mail. 
13369 great product 
13370 Love it. Works great with my Olympus E420. Easy set up and works with AAA batteries, which were provided for both units. 
13371 I got this for my daughter s birthday and she loves it. I bought the accessories but she wants to get more. I ll leave it up to her to get the extras. 
13372 Maybe it s great product, but it s not that easy to use. 
13373 Super cute bag that matches surprisingly well with the Fuji Instamax raspberry colored camera! The material is really soft and the case opens 3 different ways so you can snap a picture on the go. Overall great case! 
13374 Very good! 
13375 Exactly what I expected 
13376 The charger and batteries work fine. I received them quickly and put them to use immediately. I had occasion to use the batteries and charger extensively on a recent vacation and they performed well. 
13377 Lots of options, could have lived with 1/2 of them for what I do. But nice that they are there if I do need them. 
13378 Works. Paired with my YN560-II flash (with built in reciever). 
13379 Perfect and battery works great in my samsung camera 
13380 Its advertised as new, the product is not and wont hold charge 
13381 Works just fine. 
13382 This one is a bit shorter than the original that came with the lens, but that is not a problem. It screws on much more snuggly than the original, so I m hoping this one won t fall off and be lost! 
13383 So glad I saw this before laying out $160 more for the Really Right Stuff version! 
13384 Great product. If you are not tech savory you will need to get support. Online support is great. 
13385 good 
13386 Good price for a quality pod. I use vortex for all my scopes binos and spotter 
13387 Finally a battery charger that actually works for my model of Sony handycam. Ty Ty Ty. 
13388 Not bad for a small camera. 
13389 works on the Nikon lens that it was manufactured to fit. Mine was busted so I purchased the replacement. 
13390 Doesn t fit any canons 
13391 excellent 
13392 The photos speak for themselves. An outstanding camera. 
13393 The camera cleaning kit that was purchased arrived promptly and is exactly what I want. 
13394 not as good of quality as I would like, but for the price it s alright. 
13395 Good price and long lasting. 
13396 PERFECT!! 
13397 The documentation is in unintelligible English. Product support is non-existent. Returned. 
13398 Worked for the first day and then sensor wouldn t recognize motion. Not a good product. 
13399 Compact, great pictures, simple to use, good value for money. 
13400 Quick and as described 
13401 I like the fact that the charges has a plug right on it rather than having to lug the electrical cord around as is the case in the original charger. 
13402 BUYER BEWARE... Both zipper pulls from main compartment broke off in less than 3 months... the shoulder strap also broke in half. This case have only been used lightly since I bought it... I guess you get what you pay for. 
13403 it´s my second MegaGear, i have one for my G16, and love it. 
13404 Inexpensive way to get macro effects. Works best on 3rd objects (e.g. bugs, flowers, etc.) Not good for magnifying flat surfaces due to edge effects. 
13405 Bought this for my daughter s GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition. It worked great and made using the GoPro a breeze. We used it in and out of the water. 
13406 item simply did not work 
13407 useful good condition 
13408 It s takes really good pics. I was surprised. No problem with the camera. I use it underwater all the time. Great buy 
13409 Not always reliable but can usually get it operable after a bit of fussing. Serves its purpose for the price. 
13410 It works as expected. Since it is very inexpensive, and it comes in a pack of five, I don t mind putting new ones one as old ones break or fall off. So far so good, I have not had any failed on me yet. 
13411 It would be a better product if the batteries came in plastic carrying cases, such as Lumix batteries. This allows storage in camera bag without the contacts getting dirty. 
13412 I think it worked fine for the price, what do all the complainers want. 
13413 Excellent product! 
13414 Great bag, lots of compartments, just what I needed for a work bag. 
13415 Omg this is just what I expected an more ! Great conatruction , great materials ! Smooth and simple ! Amazing !!!! If you don t buy this as your first tripod you are just dumb ! 
13416 After I figured out how to work it, I can t complain about the camera, although the booklet that came with it was missing things so had to download it online. 
13417 Viviparous - the old standard at a great price. 
13418 The hight of the mount slide was too shallow for my GoPro Hero 3 clip and I could not insert the clip. Nice try but useless. 
13419 Love this lens! I use it for landscape and night sky photography. Yes, it is a little bulky and heavy but I feel that is a fair price to pay for the results that it can achieve. 
13420 Monitor had to be sent back to uniden for repair 1week after installation!!! Very disappointed and inconvenienced! Still haven t heard back from manufacturer! 
13421 Excelente 
13422 This lens works great, it is very light zoom is smooth. I recommend this lens 
13423 This product functions as designed and is definitely small and light but I d recommend getting the Jellyfish tripod instead. You ll be happier if you do. 
13424 Beautiful and has enough space for many things 
13425 The charge doesn t last very long, almost the same as the original Sony battery that I ve had for a few years - which is why I purchased new batteries. 
13426 Great 
13427 One of the leds doesn t work. Even thought the battery is fully charged (I ve charged them and switched them) One of the leds nevers turns on green. Besides that minor inconvenience the product works as described. 
13428 I m so pleased with the product and the speedily delivery! Great doing business with, I highly recommend! 
13429 Works very well and charges batteries quickly. Easy to use. 
13430 It s OK. 
13431 Now I just don t have to worry about not having a battery when I need it the most. 
13432 Cheap quality. If you are looking to save money go ahead. This mount will fall over and it will not stay in place when you wrap the legs around things. The camera is too heavy for the top ball it will slowly move and fall back. 
13433 works well 
13434 I liked the product 
13435 Price is right and comes with a 12v adapter as well. 
13436 Spectaculiar 
13437 Works great but would have liked some way to attach wrist/hand strap. It s still an excellent value. 
13438 Great picture quality at a very affordable price. Easily connected to my current ADT system. 
13439 This is such a great product! The camera is very easy to use and it has great pictures from it. When I was a child I always wanted a Polaroid camera and now I do. This is so much better than any other Polaroid camera. 
13440 Good product 
13441 Easy to use. Works great! It s much more convenient than using my smartphone app to take pics. Well worth the money. 
13442 I expected this pencil to be able to mark the back of photos. It does not. Was I incorrect in my expectation? 
13443 great backup battery. 
13444 No instructions or HDMI cable. 
13445 I had this camera for about a month now and it s awesome. I barely had problems with it, and it took great videos, photos, and more! 
13446 Works very good as expecyed 
13447 So far so good. 
13448 I love the color it s really lovely 
13449 These are great to keep up with camera in the water. I love the colors too! 
13450 It works just the way it supposed to be. 
13451 Perfect fit! 
13452 Perfect, was give the part info from Panasonic so I could find it on Amazon. It is just what I wanted and needed 
13453 Setting it up was easy because of the instructional videos you provided. I use this for filming videos. Seems like great quality and has a sturdy and solid build. 
13454 Package delivered on time, products such as described, all excellent, recommended 100%. 
13455 Great price and the filters work great! 
13456 Great case. Really fast shipping. Really easy to modify if you have made upgrades go your Phantom or controller. Very satisfied 
13457 good strap 
13458 Works where other cables don t. Long enough to avoid most issues. 
13459 works great in the night with no light and the sound is awesome. 
13460 It work wonderful, I really enjoy it. 
13461 I with I had one when I lost my gopro at the lake 
13462 great replacement strap 
13463 Super cheap plastic. Horrible video quality. Wasn t worth the $26 amazon prime day special. Returned it. 
13464 Had trouble with this product. It ended up not being compatible with my camera(Sony HDR-SR11) as advertised. However, the company I bought it from provided excellent customer service. I was able to return it. 
13465 Perfect fit. Access to the lock button when reversed. You wont be able to manual focus with it reversed though. 
13466 Works well in 2008 Honda CRV. 
13467 Very strong and durable. 
13468 It is excellent , it better and more power than regular Canon bsttery. Fast delivery. Thanks. 
13469 Very good accessory. Very solid, very good quality. Ideal for shooting at low altitude. The videos are fluids naturally no jumps or abrupt movements. The gripper has a non-slip protection, useful. I totally recommend. 
13470 Using this for cave photography/video very pleased with the results. 
13471 Used for sides of van 
13472 Very satisfied with purchase. 
13473 For the price, it is perfect for someone like me (a beginner) to mess around with some fun additions to my camera. 
13474 Snug fit on the lens and great protection to the lens. 
13475 Nice and sturdy piece of equipment. We mainly use it for our company s office pictures as well as pictures of our many field locations. Adjustable legs makes it pretty much suitable for any surface if you re willing to adjust the legs just right. 
13476 The camera never worked and a child was very dissappointed. Do not buy this camera. 
13477 It s a little too compact for the Lumix FX100 basic camera, and replacement battery. I need a larger case but the case is built great. 
13478 As expected 
13479 Good picture, too bad the lens scratch easily. Make sure you shake your camera underwater to get all the bubbles out before recording. Or another tip is to remove and reattach the filter while under water 
13480 This is good staf, now I can take photos for long time and many hours, it work with my Nikon D-5100 camera very well. 
13481 Great value, work as expected. Thanks! 
13482 excellent product. 
13483 A must have 
13484 Great product, would buy again. 
13485 It is great and really easy to use and the pictures a re good quality and clear. 
13486 Worked out great. 
13487 Excellent quality for a very low price! 
13488 Love this modern technical device for keeping an eye on the baby! This is a different generation of parents and they like to keep on top of the sleep schedule. This is an easy way to do it. Syncs with your cell phone. 
13489 Works very well & is easy to use 
13490 Very bad product. It show no value for money 
13491 The camera is wonderful,I really got what I wanted at a very great price 
13492 You just can t beat this deal! My batteries work perfectly, no problem shooting a full day of my son s baseball tournaments. I highly recommend product and seller. 
13493 Great deal! Love the dual charging ability. Thanks! 
13494 Took this on a trip to Africa. The worked great so far! 
13495 soft on the neck, and easy to put on the camera. 
13496 love it 
13497 Incredible prime lens. 
13498 It has a ton of features. I m just beginning to learn and try them out. It s fun! 
13499 bought this as a gift for my husband. It is a sweet case. It holds a lot of the accessories that we have for the go pro. very strong and durable 
13500 The one thing I slider is supposed to do is move left to right smoothly. Not only are there a lot of kinks in the move, it also wobbles forward and backwards along the track. 
13501 It worked as advertised. 
13502 Bought two. Each charged in less than 2 hours with Canon charger, but both were depleted of charge in 2 days. One with no use and the other used to take only 2 photographs. My rating would be a minus 5 stars. 
13503 Great replacement batteries for a good price. Have alwYs used Sarah I. 
13504 Excelente producto 
13505 What we needed - works great for camcorder and DSLR. 
13506 Not was explained.. Wasted money! 
13507 Walter did a great job assisting me and this is the 5th foscam camera I purchased and plan on purchasing more 
13508 I love this. It works great and arrived quickly 
13509 arrived fast and worked as I had planned. 
13510 I got the one before the session came out and the selfie stick sucks and the car mount broke once i touched it 
13511 Works well 
13512 Good 
13513 Got the camera used as a gift with Chatger. This one works just fine and charges fast! 
13514 Great camera, easy to use, and the movie capability captures good quality sound 
13515 Great, it works perfectly!!! 
13516 Extremely upset! Wish i could give it zero stars. I did not receive what was pictured. It was suppose to be film with rainbow borders instead they all have white borders. Will be returning. 
13517 I really do Like how straight forwardly useful this product is. I wish I had ordered it earlier. It s versatile and I can t find any fault. 
13518 Excellent Product 
13519 worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks. 
13520 Got two for remote locations and meeting my needs, excellent. 
13521 Good quality, very relaible 
13522 excelent , no problem 
13523 love the versatility 
13524 Awsome good 
13525 excellent fit and finish, works good. 
13526 Good product, Works as described haven t used it yet in the field cause ive been fighting my GoPro to update correctly but is sturdy built well and holds the GoPro very well. would recommend for somebody looking to either film live feed or charge for longer time lapse/video 
13527 No reason not to give 5 stars, the product charges batteries and the batteries run my gopro..cant be mad at that! 
13528 Great product and prompt shipment! Thanks!! 
13529 I ordered this just to see the quality and to hold two JTL light stands. I am extremely surprised at the quality and the protection it gives to my light stands. I will be ordering more of them as I order more light stands. 
13530 Very high quality archival storage pages. I m moving family slides out of carousels and into these to save space. 
13531 Looks like the TV is on from outside. Somebody must be home, right? 
13532 Worked Directly without doing anything.... Just inserted it into the USB port of my Surface Pro 3 and Windows Hello was ready to scan my fingerprints... 
13533 i loved the camera, its great thank you 
13534 Fantastic camera!! 
13535 Calvin did a wonderful job and was very fast! 
13536 Needed this for my Kodak camera, however I paid about $20-24 dollars about 2 years ago on here, which I thought was kind of pricey. It does get the job done though. 
13537 Like having as a practical spare 
13538 Carlos, did an excellent job helping me with my camera 
13539 The card makes it worthwhile but probably won t use most of the items. 
13540 Perfect 
13541 The package arrived much earlier than promised. Excellent! The buckle s quality has room for improvement. The hook got pulled sideways by 2 MM after a week s use. 
13542 Easy to use and works well 
13543 Perfect operation simple install! You know someone s out front before they do! Range football field not bad! 
13544 I just love the camera the pictures that come are excellent 
13545 I thought it will be other type of camera with more features but still good for my photography classes. 
13546 Good for the price .The first times the stick rotated sometime but after some time it got harder and holds well big phones. Still using a lot after several months. 
13547 Very sharp, relatively light, and the AF is quick enough for fast subjects. 
13548 Cheaper than buying one of the clock nanny cams.. Works great, easy to program when connected to your PC.. 
13549 Good Material only first time to open is a little bit hard. 
13550 Works great! 
13551 I love it :) 
13552 Cannot beat it for the price. Great little lens and FUN to shoot with it. VERY pleased with this purchase and even though it is a manual focus it is easy to work with. The manual focus actually helps you to become a better photographer. 
13553 Does not fit well 
13554 So far, everything works great. My son ordered a GoPro for our vacation. His has issues and their tech support has been very lacking. I ordered a GeekPro and started to test it on Thursday. The picture quality is excellent and no issues were noted. Thanks for your prompt shipment! 
13555 I was looking for something to fit my Sony RX100 iii and this is perfect. It s kind of tight for it but it s work and it can also fit into my pockets. I needed something sturdy in case of an impact and this seem strong enough for it. 
13556 NICE! 
13557 Exactly as stated 
13558 great seller - delivered as promised! 
13559 The video quality is great. Love the microphone option. We are using this as a baby monitor. 
13560 Very nice product. Easy to install. Image and audio is not affected by the drop case. Rain, day, night, night vision is not affect by lens cover. Recommend this product. Perfect fit for my nest cam. 
13561 This item is as advertised. Seller shipped quickly. Would buy again. Two thumbs up. 
13562 Awesome results for a fraction of the price! Very cool close ups! Great for close ups of jewelry and insects. Worth every penny! 
13563 Good quality good price 
13564 Perfect! Highly Recommended ☺ 5 ★ STARS ★ Thanks! A+ 
13565 Does the job. Not as nice as the Nikon one. But at 1/3 the price and a couple free goodies in the box. 
13566 Very Good 
13567 The graduated filter works but isn t really dark enough in my opinion to make a huge difference. The build quality is very cheap and dust sticks to the glass like crazy. Not even close to being a high end grad filter, but will work kinda-sorta-ok. 
13568 Great product! Thank you for shipping it sooo fast!!!! 
13569 This is the first microscope I have ever owned. For the price it s a nice product. Very professional. Love hooking it up to the computer for a larger screen. No issues so far. 
13570 Great product 
13571 Works perfect! Arrived sooner than expected. Haven t had any problems with it. 
13572 Perfect 
13573 Great camera for the price!! Highly recommend 
13574 i keep getting asked if the round part is a bottler opener.... 
13575 Great product. Now I have a place to put my filters without leaving them on my lenses. The microfiber cleaning cloth; good addition. Thanks. 
13576 Right product..timely shipping....great price...charged right up...ready to use as a back-up!!! 
13577 Works just as well as the Canon brand battery and charger that I left somewhere in America s national parks last month. A great, cost-effective replacement. 
13578 Wow..!! Fantastic camera as I want. Its fell up my expectation. 
13579 The PERFECT case for traveling with the Inspire 1. Period. 
13580 This thing is big but then I bought it for the Tamron 150-600 which fits just right in it when locked at 150mm with the hood reversed and including the lens collar. Note: lens only, no camera attached. 
13581 These came with attached nice retaining strings, along with extra paste on strings. Great buy also with another Magic Fibre cloth too. 
13582 I LOVE IT....O PLAY IT ALL DAY FOR TWO YEARS NOW 
13583 The tripod itself is great for the price. It does the job that I need it to do. The carrying case on the other hand is terrible. I have had it just under two months and the strap has already come apart. 
13584 it is not charging anymore!!!!! 
13585 Works and fits my A6000 kit 55-210 lens perfectly! 
13586 Don t over fill easier to tie off 
13587 Worked out great, have plenty of room for accessories. 
13588 Arrived quickly and in great condition.It works ok but doesn t seem to last quite as the original. Just a little weaker I think. 
13589 first one got dunked in the ocean - loved the lens so much, I ordered a new one 
13590 these have been perfect for my new instant camera that i use on a regular basis. so fun & vintage. we display our photos on our fridge and in an instant film sized album. 
13591 Nicely padded, my dad loves it just wish it was a little bit longer 
13592 Snuggly holds my cards safely, I really like it. 
13593 It wasn t what I needed. 
13594 The clamp is great but the quick release tabs on the base of the neck both broke over the course of the first few uses. Now only the clamp is of any use. I wouldn t recommend this at current quality and durability levels. 
13595 worked as expected 
13596 works great. Also nice useful kit included. 
13597 Works great on my camera. I can now easily change from a neck strap to wrist strap in seconds and it is very sturdy. 
13598 Very attractive and sturdy posing stool. Assembly was very simple but because of the skimpy packaging, the seat-cushion was left with a large indentation mark that has not gone away after about 4 weeks. The height adjusting mechanism works well. 
13599 Good quality and love that it is not attached with a sticker, rather a secure cord. 
13600 Half didn t work 
13601 Bought this less than 6 months ago and barely made use of it but one of the batteries is a dud already. Disappointed! 
13602 Not as good as some other mini tripods, but it gets the job done. 
13603 Perfect. 
13604 Package was exactly as promised and received in excellent condition. 
13605 Awesome camera! Very fun and easy to use. Film is expensive, but what isn t these days? 
13606 Excellent product 
13607 didn t fit my gh1 
13608 Much better than the GoPro stock batteries, and these were fresh and let me motovlog for a lot longer without cutting me off early. 
13609 It s a great lens. there is a lot of distortion, but it s possibile to compensate using Camera Raw. Buy yhis just if you know how to work in iperfocal. 
13610 Camera is sold by Vivitar as &#34;underwater&#34; witha picture of a diver on the front of the box, yet on further review of the fine print, is only &#34;water resistant to 10 feet&#34;. This is a gross misrepresentation. Buy a go pro or another cheaper camera that is truley waterproof. 
13611 Detail of material 
13612 nice purchase 
13613 This has been a lot of fun to play with. Works fine. 
13614 Works really well... for the price 
13615 Terrible, terrible , terrible!!!!! 
13616 I completely adore these, they are a great catch for something more vintage fashioned when it comes to scrapbooking or even just for a wedding guestbook.Everyone had tons of fun with it, and we ve added it to our best times activity. just to incorporate some of everyone in it! 
13617 great item A++++ 
13618 works great 
13619 Wrong Key code on the software disk. Software will not load. 
13620 I love this tripod it is very tall as it says 5 7 it has a very nice height and it is light weight It works well with my Samsung Dv150f 
13621 Function OK. Quality OK. Delivery takes time from China. 
13622 For the price the quality surprised me. I m pleasantly surprised and happy. 
13623 I have Wasabi batteries for my Canon cameras and GoPro Hero 2 and 3. Better than OEM, more power so they last longer. Love the batteries, the chargers are OK - they use the same base and just attach the appropriate battery specific connector. This keeps sliding off. Annoying. 
13624 The Sony is great 
13625 and the service was also! Thanks Beach, I ll come again. 
13626 was a good value for a full frame sensor but returned for the D750 which is well worth the the price difference for the added features and low light performance. Wi-fi, flip screen, and higher usable iso made it a not brainer. 
13627 They are great! Price is great! 
13628 Great little storage album with contemporary feel for 5X7 photos that includes a business card holder. After purchasing the first one, I ve ordered two more. Build is excellent and pages very clear and durable. 
13629 Units work, but video quality leaves a little to be desired. 
13630 works great for my Panasonic camera and accessories, just right size not too big but still fits everything 
13631 exactly what i expected. each lens is a little magnifying glass and pivots. you can individually tighten each one. 
13632 good 
13633 Use it almost anywhere. 
13634 Kenneth helped me with a wireless connect problem. I am setting up a C1. This is my 4th Foscam and every one is doing the job. There can be a long hold time for tech support but they fix it as promised. Highly reccomend Foscam. 
13635 By far the best camera in its class for the price! Make sure you shop around for the best deal and you will love this camera! It is very user friendly and takes amazing pictures for experienced Photographer and newbies! 
13636 Great price, got it quickly. 
13637 Great product and great service from company. 
13638 now my tool box matches the rest of my gear cases 
13639 Gr8 cam 
13640 Was just what I was looking for to Go Pro paddleboarding 
13641 Great 
13642 I recommend 100% 
13643 Using one on each of my Jeeps. One of which is used on a fender lip mount. 
13644 Descent midrange price flash. Nothing special. Use for times when a flash is required additional lighting. Not good for doing creative lighting. 
13645 Prompt service, good price. 
13646 Buen producto. 
13647 Great colors! 
13648 Couldn t get this to work with my Nikon D600. 
13649 Good Quality and Products, just what I needed for my small jewelry photography. 
13650 Does not fit my sb400 
13651 Well made but a tight fit for a camera with a zoom lens attached 
13652 cheap 
13653 Lasted longer than standard battery 
13654 Film worked as intended, wish it was less cost effective, remember to not shake the photos and to place in the box the film came in to help develop them faster. 
13655 Looks like a good quality product, but unfortunately it doesn t fit my gopro as advertised. I have a gopro hero 3. This skeleton housing is slightly too big for the houaing my gooro came with. Too bad. 
13656 Good quality camera for the price, but alternative software is highly recommended. 
13657 Did not like this item the lights are not bright enough to light the background properly for a good photo. I ve tried everything with this box and my photos do not come out nearly as well as my last box ( different brand). 
13658 Great Camera!! 
13659 solid, solid, solid!!! 
13660 My daughter was pleased 
13661 Worked very well shipped quickly and packaged well. All in all is what it says and does what it is supposed to do 
13662 Good kit. A couple of additional ways to attach the camera that didn t rely on an enclosure for the camera to be purchased would make it a great kit. 
13663 stylish and well made. Blue tooth works wonderfully and is easy to use. Camera is high quality; however, it seems to aim low. Like it is made for people with low setting ears. I only capture about the bottom 2/3 of whatever I am looking at when using the camera. 
13664 We swam with wild dolphins.Zip lined across a rain forest.Rode horses threw the jungle and jet boarded in puerto vallarta.But by far the funniest thing was clipping a go pro to our American bull dog puppy.Good bargain for a durable product.Ive told many friends about this deal. 
13665 Excellent product .... just missing the feature to turn off the IR in menu, but everything else is there. very quiet, fast, software support multiple cameras, works very well. Audio and Mic are perfect! .... so far GOOD 
13666 I have flew it just about 5 times. I carefully read some of the comments here and yes you should make sure you rad and review any information prior to flying this copter. I could see how it could flay away if you don t read the instructions. 
13667 Nice case. Just WAY TOO BIG for our needs. Return was no problem. It seemed much bigger than the dimensions (they were correct, just seemed bigger). Had to go a different route. 
13668 Very happy with the quality of product. Does what it promises to do. With my glasses, , laptop, tablet, smartphone, and my palm pilot around, I keep these within reach. Thanks 
13669 Works as expected. 
13670 Dual zipper close -- one zipper broke off within the first week. Velcro &#34;separator panels&#34; are less effective than expect. However, OTHER than that, sturdily constructed -- size\design supports ease of use. 
13671 happy 
13672 Great grip / cool design / move on! ;-) 
13673 They work great put off good light. Carrying bag is cheap and zipper is too but I didn t buy it for the case. Switch was broken on one of the chords but no biggie to just fix myself with a new switch. 
13674 Skeleton frame and clear lens cover fits my Hero4 Silver perfectly. All ports, lights, and mic line up with holes in the case. It also comes with a threaded tripod mount. 
13675 Great cams! Looks perfect 
13676 Excellent 
13677 Still charging after 8 months of daily use. 
13678 I use this for snorkeling in the red sea on deployment and for riding my bike at home. couldn t be happier! 
13679 Nice camera with a lot of features. 
13680 Camera takes good quality video. The waterproof case makes the sound not so great. The mounts are decent but DO NOT over tighten them. 
13681 asdescribed/ fast ship/ fair price/ recommend seller. 
13682 Bought this until I can afford a Nuba led ring light. I m actually really impressed with the performance. I have it paired with a neewer 750 ttl flash and Nikon d3300 
13683 The system did exactly what I needed. Soon after using the charger to charge my existing batteries and the new battery, the old charger that I was unable to locate in 3 weeks of tearing the house apart was found in plain sight. 
13684 It served it purpose... 
13685 Best bang for the buck. I ve used a few of these and they work great. haven t gotten a filter stuck on one yet, unlike some other brands I ve tried. 
13686 This camera has helped me collect so many precious memories... 
13687 Takes great clear pictures and is light weight. Easy to place in a small purse... 
13688 This is nice and works well for my once a month photo sessions. I can t say how it would hold up if you used it everyday and traveled with it. It replaces one almost the same, although this one does have a nicer carry bag. 
13689 Very light weight, sturdy easily holding a video head, a DSLR , lens and a slider. gets low, goes high. Feet are soft rubber for inside, reveling metal spikes for outside. Great no nonsense tripod. 
13690 terrible quality, the camera is way to small, it is plastic witch makes it eel like youre using a toy, it sucks 
13691 Great kit at a great value. I only gave it 4 stars because the selfie stick is useless. It can t handle the weight of the gopro and won t hold it upright. It just spins around and faces down. Other than that piece, the rest seems to be great. 
13692 The camera works wonderful and it was the best deal I found! 
13693 good really sharp pictures? good camera 
13694 Smooth , firm , and steady , the ball bearings do the trick ! Awesome great price 
13695 Still learning how to use. Older eyes and small screens.... 
13696 returned it ---not good 
13697 it helped me wonderful!!! i would recommend it truly , THANKS 
13698 Great portable tripod..that can handle full sized DSLR and lens. 
13699 A+ 
13700 Great lens. All items were as listed. Would purchase again. 
13701 Worked fine. I recommend! 
13702 Good product for the price. Takes nice pictures. 
13703 Crazy sharp! 
13704 as advertised 
13705 perfect deal. came exactly as expected 
13706 Great product and prompt shipment! Thanks!! 
13707 for the price, it s worth it. most of the cradles are very tight fitting but they all make it eventually. the case is bulky and there is really no good way to get it all in the case. But, again, for the price you can t beat it. 
13708 Worked perfectly. Car charger is an added bonus!! 
13709 adequate for the task at hand. 
13710 Very pleased with this product! High quality and the cases included are excellent. 
13711 This product is so nice my daughter displays it on her desk with her pictures 
13712 Return wasn t one we wanted 
13713 great product 
13714 This is an excellent lens for any photographer/digital artist. I bought the lens for my Nikon D3200. You must use this lens in manual mode settings on camera. After reviewing fisheye attachment lens and true fisheye lens, definitely spend the extra money for a true fisheye lens. 
13715 Like it better than other tripods-more flexibility 
13716 Bought this for my daughter to take to her trip to Iceland, she was able to fit her camera and lenses in there nicely and loved that she could slide the bag over the handle of her suitcase. Pricey but worth the investment. 
13717 great buy since the batteries on the go pro run out quickly 
13718 Very nice! 
13719 Amazing!!! 
13720 Excelent product 
13721 This charger pack is an incredible value. I love this new charger. Would recommend 100%. 
13722 There batteries really aren t any good. Most times they only charge to 75-80% and they drain way to fast, even when they sit in the camera and it s turned off. 
13723 love it! it even comes with the hardware to tighten the screws 
13724 Quality glass that is still kicking on my camera a year later. I have nothing bad to say about this product. Will buy again. A+ 
13725 Works perfect with the flash, no TTL (i already know it before buying). 
13726 Great for 1 dslr camera but not if your needing to carry more then one dslr. 
13727 Fast and quit focusing, Sharp Photo s 
13728 Camera was like new. Works perfectly and was purchased as a replacement for my broken camera. This like new one reminded me why I bought the original in the first place. Takes fabulous pictures and is light enough to take anywhere. 
13729 Works great. Tested the batteries and they charge and work fine. 
13730 A little thinner than I expected it to be. If working remotely, be sure nothing reflective like a tv, photograph is behind it as it will reflect the light and give you hot spots. 
13731 Exactly what I needed 
13732 just what I needed 
13733 Fantastic 
13734 Well-made product. Nicely priced. Arrived quickly and nicely packaged. Exactly what my daughter wanted. I am sure there will be many many selfies in her cuter. Hopefully, no duck-face. One can hope. 
13735 Super 
13736 Good Product 
13737 Perfect. Exactly what I needed, and arrived in time for my trip to meet my new grandosn, and now I can take pictures because my camera is charged. :) 
13738 Always,we re human and will have accidents. 
13739 I like the mount. Should have ribbed the barrel so it won t drop down on the stem over rough roads. 
13740 Fantastic Quality Color 
13741 It s a lot smaller than I thought it would be. Will definitely not fit a 70-200mm lens. Lengthwise or width wise. 
13742 Great tripod 
13743 Loved it! 
13744 very good and steady tripod 
13745 The tilt motion has some tension but the pan is really smooth 
13746 No problem at all. Shipment time very fast. easy to use, very good quality of pictures. the package was definitely good 
13747 This is so easy to use. Works very well. 
13748 works very well!!!!!!!!!!!! 
13749 Works great 
13750 Works great, no problems everything as described 
13751 It fits perfectly my Sony HX90V 
13752 Perfect replacement lens for one that was dropped in the water at the beach. Works great. 
13753 Good: Solid Cheese construction Solid when Screwed down. Bad: No real bad things to say yet. Gets a bit in the way of using the view finder, flipped around or not because of the little butt end that sticks out. 
13754 Best friend of Sony Alpha 6000 mirrorless camera for panoramic photo and video with a relative short lens (like 35mm - 85 mm). Otherwise you may need to mount this grip to the lens itself. 
13755 Glad I got this when I bought my camera. Perfect protector of the lens at a very good price! 
13756 Fine 
13757 Does not work at all. Does not hold a charge for the camera. Basically I bought a $50 wall clock 
13758 decent quality 
13759 It works! I am using this with a Tamron 90mm macro on my OM-D and it works perfectly. The tolerances are nice and tight and the images are great! I have a fotodiox adapter for Canon FD and for Nikon and they all work great! 
13760 Exactly what I was looking for 
13761 Bags are really loose, neoprene is really thin, won t protect your lenses! 
13762 Would be super with a USB plug instead of a car port. Live in the now! 
13763 good 
13764 FLIMSEY, CANNOT OPEN THE BACK. DON T BUY IT. 
13765 This is so thin. I thought it would be thicker and not look like a piece of cheap cloth. 
13766 Works really good easy to set up as well.cameras are not the best and 2 of the 4 got wet when it rained other 2 still work good. Company did replace them free of charge. Other than that for price u realy can t go wrong. 
13767 This has a one way viewer only, but a good one. Like it. 
13768 First time tactual,y ordering these but aftually love it &#60;3 came at the same time it said 
13769 Exactly what was needed and wanted. Thank you for the opportunity to once again have my camera. LF 
13770 Works as advertised. I purchased these as back up batteries for my camera and they work just fine. 
13771 It was a good flash, but it just stopped working about two months later and the company is completely unresponsive. 
13772 Great Camera Day or night! Great Value as well........ 
13773 More than enough for me. 
13774 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039BPG1A/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_13 
13775 Works 
13776 CASE# C6726445 BADGE ID # AR004228 DLINK tech support made everything a breeze. From A to B, the whole setup was simple and easy. Jenny assisted very clearly and in a friendly tone. The camera is of high quality. Definitely buying more DLINK products in the near future. 
13777 My daughter loves this camera & took gorgeous pictures through Ireland, Italy & England!! 
13778 works well, is solid, but much heavier than I expected. 
13779 Very pleased / works great / had a defective camera called GW and a RM Number was given to return camera / will update progress 
13780 Ample space; well built; good looking; fits the bill perfectly for my needs 
13781 kenneth did a wonderful job answering my questions. 
13782 served my needs 
13783 Highly recommended!! Great product. It can be folded to less than 10 inch long, has a sturdy build and work as expected. 
13784 IT IS HUMONGOUS! Very protective, but also very thick. I like the fact that I can wrap my lens up as a burrito or baby, hahaha. 
13785 Works as well as the battery and charger that came with my camera. Very pleased. 
13786 It is what it s advertized to be and works wel 
13787 great product 
13788 Great price, there was a 5 inch tear in the bag but I will place duck tape inside to &#34;repair&#34; the rip. Great price. Just what I need for vendor events., 
13789 Nice soft rubber, fits snug 
13790 I was really excited to get my Nikon bundle package today. But then when I took the bag off the carrying case for the camera it was dirty! Not sure if it was used? And if it was what other items in my bundle package were used then re-wrapped? 
13791 Works great. We take the battery off after Sun. AM service and it s ready to roll again by PM. 
13792 love this lens, very sharp 
13793 100% advisable 
13794 Works great cleaning my glasses and other electronic devices. Would buy again. 
13795 Works Great Now We Get to Use Our Camera again!!! 
13796 It s a Holga Lense. You don t expect low-light performance, or high quality feel ( it s all plastic) or pixel perfect reproduction. It s a nice cheap lense for experimenting with stuff. 
13797 Great picture quality 
13798 Fast delivery from Amazon. Works Great 
13799 It operates very well. I am still getting used to at the same time as with Windows 10. It replaces a lost Easy Share that had a rechargeable battery and a docking station. 
13800 Not the one pictured. It is the official made in Thailand Nikon OEM 
13801 It s works well 
13802 If u have a good camera , this product is a must. It protects your investment. 
13803 Solid. A bit heavy but on a bad thing for my rig. The holes are not universal for a AB Gold Mount which is why I got two of these but I made it work and it held. Cheaper compared to other 15mm cheese plates so I can t complain. 
13804 Higher quality lens than the 1 i had before. Great buy 
13805 Really takes so much stress off my neck, thanks so much. 
13806 It would not open on Mac 
13807 Works perfectly with my Canon M3 mirror less camera 
13808 Perfect fit for my Fujifilm S9200 and for my Digital Video Camera. It hold both and a charger at the same time. 
13809 item as described and on time. 
13810 Works good but you must have it about 3 feet off the ground and the chime is very loud a volume control would be nice 
13811 The product works flawlessly being plugged into socket. I didn t try that in autocharger. 
13812 Perfect. 
13813 This is a decent budget scanner. it won t blow your socks off but as long as you don t mind a little bit off work in Photoshop it s not bad. 
13814 does the job, but should be made out of metal for strength 
13815 does what it s supposed to. good stuff. 
13816 Perfect Bundle, good price 
13817 Excellent! 
13818 This is the perfect lens for everyday shots. It s fast and compact. 
13819 Great scope for the low price ,I bought this for astrophotography. It is well built and works great. I also have the 500-1000mm same brand and from same company 
13820 The moon shots are very good. I have had no problems with my new scopes. 
13821 works really well for the price 
13822 This camera is easy to use. Just follow the instruction, I get the video appear in my Android app. The night vision of this camera is poor. 
13823 Great item 
13824 Great camera. You can t beat the Leica lens. 
13825 Excellent! 
13826 What can I say but these lights are perfect! 
13827 It is very good 
13828 Remote viewing is very slow compared to older models. It sucks but the set up is much easier. 
13829 WISH IT WORKED LONGER DISTANCE 
13830 A++++++ 
13831 Does not bring any SD card 6 feet of cable what is that good for you would need an outlet on every camera very very poor quality video super super cheap quality!!!!!!! 
13832 As described! 
13833 It s very well made and is the perfect fit for our canon camera! We never worry about throwing it in a bag and damaging the camera. Feels protected. 
13834 Great quality! Works well. 
13835 This is a great camera 
13836 The image quality is excellent! 
13837 Great quality 
13838 This was a part of a Christmas gift for my daughter and she likes it tho the photos are rather small. 
13839 Garbage product. Broke before I could install it. Again, IT BROKE BEFORE IT WAS USED. That s a little problematic. Don t waste your money. Buy the Canon version. Mine Canon cable is still going strong 6+ years after its purchase. 
13840 Excellent!! 
13841 Great product. I used it when hiking and it held up. 
13842 Works perfect 
13843 good 
13844 It takes forever to charge an NP970! 
13845 Hero2 mounted gimbal-less under my phantom 2, and I have ZERO jello. Awesome. 
13846 it does what it says. 
13847 ♡ 
13848 They seem to work just fine. I have quite a few; probably more than I need. 
13849 Henry, Called for help getting set-up to access my camera on my mobile device. Henry was able to use team viewer and went over what he was doing with in 3-5 minutes I was able to connect to my camera! 
13850 Works really well. Keep forgetting to turn the mic on and off but the battery seems to be holding up well. 
13851 These are excellent - we keep a pile of them around the house as they re the only effective glasses cleaner around. 
13852 Excellent 
13853 Beautiful pics. Had some glitches at first but Ricoh helped out. Easy to use and the picture quality is awesome. 
13854 I am pleased with product. I haven t used it yet but I am just glad that it fits my camera 
13855 Works and fast shipping! 
13856 I use this lens probably the most - it gets me just the right amount of zoom, and the pictures come out super sharp and clear. Its not clunky or heavy to carry either. 
13857 thanks 
13858 Bold and nice quality signs! These signs are hard to miss and should serve as a deterrent to would be trespassers. 
13859 It does a very bad job of zoom. The zoom feature was why I purchased the camera and if you use the zoom the pics are blurry. I am very disappointed. 
13860 Excellent value 
13861 Good price, good product. Used them to mount lights for video making. 
13862 Volume down button didn t work. I got s replacement and the same thing was wrong with the replacement. I ended up returning both and got a different camera. 
13863 I ordered. I charged. It just did not work. So, I returned... 
13864 Love it, the quality of the recordings are a lot better than I expected. 
13865 great bag. arrived as promised. lots of versatility. 
13866 Im happy with the quality and texture of this strap. Im using it on a fujifilm x100t and its secure and at an ideal length. There are slight abbrasion marks on the strap from the camera rubbing against the strap, but Ive conditioned this strap and it restored the texture. 
13867 Purchased to wire up security cameras. I checked all with continuity tester and all were functional. 
13868 Fits perfectly with my glasses on. Not easy to install on a D90 but with a little extra force, made it to fit. I mostly shoot outdoors so having less light coming from the side of your eye helps a lot. 
13869 Good buy 
13870 Shipping very fast and easy install. Picture quality is good. 
13871 It fits perfectly ..It goes on the computer and camera. 
13872 Great batteries! The batteries last longer than the original GoPro battery. Charger has built in plug making it easier to travel with since there are fewer parts to keep track of. Great products. 
13873 ok 
13874 The best Camera ever!! 
13875 It fit the camera but did not work. 
13876 Works great and is definitely as advertised! 
13877 Perfecr 
13878 Very unreliable. When it works, it s great. But I cannot tell you how many times live view simply does not work and I cannot tell you how many times when I try to respond to an alert it simple says &#34;cannot connect right now&#34;. And forget it working wirelessly. 
13879 This battery offers more power time (2600 mAh against 1800 mAh Canon battery) for your camera. 
13880 This is an awesome monopod. Used with point and shoot and a 6d 
13881 nice 
13882 Great Buy solid picture quality for landscapes 
13883 Works and fast shipping! 
13884 Still learning to use them but I like it a lot. 
13885 I bought this for my daughter who will be a freshman in college this year. It is very easy to use and VERY loud. Hope she never has to actually use it. 
13886 Excellent Filter as expected. 
13887 Significantly more compact than the charger included with the A7Rii, and with added LEDs to tell you how far along the charge process is. I consider a pair of these to be an essential part of a Sony kit. 
13888 Love 
13889 Does not work for the whole range. after a certain point it starts showing an &#34;X&#34; in the picture because areas along the diagonals are darkened more than rest of the image. 
13890 Nice 
13891 👎 
13892 Returned this one as it is not what I expected. 
13893 ok;-))) 
13894 The product was received in fine condition and was what I expected. The problem is that the movies and pictures on the TV are not in color. This was a surprise. 
13895 This case works great. It fits the camera perfectly and keeps it protected 
13896 Flys great, camera works great, excellent product. Once you start getting the hang of things, you should look up NAZA mode....NAZA may even better for beginners 
13897 Works well 
13898 back door does not fit Hero 3. it is too large. 
13899 Fantastic camera - still figuring out all the functions and menus, but it takes great pictures, compact in size, good battery life and much more than a point and shoot ! Shipped and delivered the same day. 
13900 Just an awesome Toy... A little Tricky but you can get used to it... 
13901 very glad I made this purchase. 
13902 Picture quality is not great but it keeps my daughter happy. 
13903 Arrive fast and exactly as described. Cheap solution for my problem. Thank you! 
13904 It s a pelican case, not much more needs to be said. Great for storing my nitrogen regulator ! Longest time I ve kept a regulator without a busted face ! 
13905 It is a good scope for the money with lots of attachments you can get for it. However like most of these lower priced ones, the tripods are pretty much useless as far as being sturdy enough. 
13906 Good Deal! 
13907 Quick order comes with a filter pouch. Nice package 
13908 Works like a charm! 
13909 I should have waited to purchase one that was a little sturdier and taller. But for the price it is alright. 
13910 nice 
13911 Was excited to find a clip-on with good reviews as opposed to my magnetic one. Make sure you are super close to the object when using the macro lens. But very happy with this product, and was compatible with my new iPhone 7 as well as my old iPhone 6 
13912 excellence, 
13913 **Product Received in exchange for honest review** Great quality tripod mount! Works great and made of very durable plastic.. This is just as good quality as any of the other tripod mounts that I own.. I highly recommend this 
13914 Nice low cost alternative to a GoPro 
13915 Camera did not meet my expectations. The quality of the photos in auto and friendly auto mode is not acceptable. 
13916 Perfect!!! 
13917 This lens kit arrived quickly, well packaged, and in good working order. I used it during my recent vacation, and was very pleased with the performance of all the lenses. 
13918 Excellent Portable tripod. I always toss one into both cars. A little light for my full size Nikon but A1 for my Canon G15 
13919 Works great........ 
13920 Item collectionable, but like new. It works fine, Im happy whit this purchase. Amazon.com is amazing. Thank´s a lot. 
13921 I am very happy not only with the camera, but the cost. As far as I am concerned, this is a new camera to me. I am going to France in the new future and I look forward to using it and getting great pictures. 
13922 Prints pictures very well, but can be hard to manage. Otherwise a very lovely, easy-to-manage camera! Gives off good vintage vibes and instantly gives you a nice bit of pretensious hipster flare. 
13923 Works great! I lost my charger somewhere when I moved and needed a replacement. Great price and it works well. No doubts my original one will show up now but at least this was a cheap replacement. 
13924 a perfect fit for the canon camera. convenient slots for sd card and extra battery. easy to carry in the hand or wrist. a really nice and compact case. 
13925 Excellent. 
13926 Excellent product.. includes everything and the fancy case is wonderful 
13927 Works great. Long battery life! 
13928 I had to return for a poorly fitted/errant propeller on the drone. A new one should be sent 
13929 does not fit well into the socket. Ruined the Connection of the original automatic lens. 
13930 Amazing camera, all came in a big box well protected, I cant wait for my next family vacation to start shooting photos, all the products that came with the bundle are great, not all are the best quality, but for the price the bundle are an excellent deal !! 
13931 Light weight and gets the job done without breaking your back. I use it for my Canon 600 at weddings. Of course you need a hot shoe attachment for flashes, don t forget that. 
13932 Does not fit well. Keeps slipping of the Canon lens it was built for. Don t waste your money on this piece of poorly made plastic. You should expect more from the lensmaker 
13933 Fast shipping and works as promised. My camera was unusable without this so I m happy to have it! 
13934 Very great purchase,thanks 
13935 OSD anything on a camera this cheap shouldn t be passed up... I ve seen alot of 800, 1000, even 1200 tvl cameras for under $20... they all look like crap in 1080p @ 48&#34;... this doesn t look bad even thou you ld expect it to 
13936 Excellent product good quality 
13937 Easyh to instal. Camera magnets to it, just like a stock mount. Gives an obtuse rather than acute angle for options for pointing the camera. 
13938 Works well with my camera 
13939 Fits to camera. allows remote control of shutter and complete control during a &#34;bulb&#34; control for minute plus shots. Reasonably priced - would buy it again. 
13940 fast delivery and just what I needed 
13941 Perfect holds my military spotting scope 
13942 Good fit 
13943 I love that camera and extra gadgets;) 
13944 This was a graduation gift from college for my daughter. She was so happy to get it and uses all of it for her work and as a hobby. Glad to have found it at AMAZON! 
13945 This is the case I use when I m taking extra things with me. 
13946 Awesome tripod. My wife bought it for me for my birthday. And it works great. I can set it almost anywhere I want and it stays. 
13947 Hope I don t have to use this but I do think its a great deal. 
13948 arrived as exactly described! I keep the senior pictures of my friends in this album, and the plastic sheets give the wallets more than enough room 
13949 Arrived quickly with a kind note from the sender. A great product really, I ve been using it well for my Sony camera lens and my computer screen. 
13950 Nice camera so far, great pictures. Talking it on trip to Utah s National; Parks. Shipped fast, well packaged. 
13951 Amazing product i use it on all my shoots for modeling 
13952 Much cheaper than the Nikon flashes, with almost the same bells and whistles. Performs great 
13953 Great product. Easy to use and ultra good video quality. This customer service is the best part of everything. They helped me through the installation process. 
13954 Great hard to find product! Very happy! 
13955 Can t use my camera without this... 
13956 Great lens 
13957 Thank you. All was well! 
13958 super camera 
13959 This meter is amazing! Growing indoors this is must have tool! I recommend this to anyone who is a beginner or expert. 
13960 great seller - delivered as promised! 
13961 For the price, this is okay, but the tripod is pretty flimsy. I m no photography expert...and I won t be with equipment like this. 
13962 nice 
13963 I like it and am enjoying it for the purpose I bought this for... I ll be back for more, it works amazingly well! 
13964 Batteries work great. 
13965 While the tubes don t lock up on my lenses like others have noted, they are not rigid. Any change in pressure on the lens causes them to flex considerably. 
13966 Overall my daughter loves it for changing at dance competitions; however, it is difficult to fold down until you have practiced several times. 
13967 I had a 12mm and it didn t give me a full view, this 16mm is about right. 
13968 Product appears to be good quality and functions as advertised. Happy with the transaction. 
13969 very good protection. good grip 
13970 I got one MagicFiber as a free trial with an order from Amazon suppler...Ordered this set ..what more can I say, they work GREAT. Ordered them for my cameras and my wife took one for her glasses... 
13971 It s AWESOME! 
13972 love this camera, its as advanced as a hobbyist needs thats not into SLRs. excellent photos and fairly easy to learn. the viewfinders fine for me ive seen some complaints. still breaking it in. if you need something larger than a cell phone camera but not super advanced its great. 
13973 The best scanner for the price! 
13974 Danny was extremely helpful and was very patient. He is a true asset to your organization. kudos to him! Product is extremely effective and delivers on the promise. 
13975 Perfect fit for my Norman LH-1 lampheads. Could have used these long ago! Nice product - protects well. 
13976 It works 
13977 Ar004214 Thank for your support I initially have trouble with my wifi but the tech service Breagan help me to set up the camara and is working very good I do have two cameras. 
13978 good 
13979 Very excellent item for the price nice resolution and double screen its nice to. 
13980 really not that impressed. 
13981 Fits on my lens perfectly - just what I wanted. 
13982 Fits just right. I m using it on my FE 35mm f/2.8. 
13983 Must have for GoPro!! 
13984 A lot more dependable than off brand knock offs 
13985 Excellent product. 
13986 Too much vignetting from using it on the lens, useless. Works ok on the hotshoe, but kinda misses the point to use it like that. 
13987 Easy to install and works reliably! 
13988 Excellent, stylish and good photos 
13989 Great price! Delivered quickly. Works well. 
13990 Looks nice. Easy to put on camera. You need to adjust it to your needs. 
13991 Great binoculars...just what we were looking for .... THANKS. 
13992 I wish the optical zoom is much better. For even close objects after full zoom I have to move closer physically to to the target to get the best pic. Unsure if theres a better way of taking pics. 
13993 On time and as described. No issues 
13994 These have lasted longer than original GoPro batteries as well as another popular 3rd party battery. Highly recommended. 
13995 Great helper, to watch out your house while you are away :) 
13996 Flash does not work as advertised. It will not work wirelessly. I contacted the seller for help, but never heard back from them. 
13997 it does not fit my camera like it was advertised!!! 
13998 This camera was exactly what I was looking for. Would give it 5 stars if the app didn t freeze up so often. Was easy to install and set up. 
13999 very good cam for the price. the instruction video was ok but could have been better. overall the camera works great and the pan tilt works much better then I thought it would. 
14000 This little bOOger is made very well, great fluidity, and craftsmanship...I highly recommend this high quality tripod. 
14001 tks 
14002 great replacement battery with fast shipping. 
14003 Works well 
14004 Great case really love how compact and protective it is. Perfect amount of space for a few accessories. I have been using it for 3 months now with a canon sl1 and don t regret getting this case at all. 
14005 The product has arrived and every thing worked as I expected. We have been using the batteries and charger regularly. 
14006 Great product. Simple and works! 
14007 This is the second fake tv I have ordered and this one worked perfectly. This is the first one I ordered from Three Bears. They were good to deal with. I would have no problem ordering another. 
14008 Fast Shipping, made very sturdy, all cameras came on clear. 
14009 perfet 
14010 These supply an excellent current level for making colloidal silver, and the addition of a couple of alligator clips converts them into great little portable generators suitable for either home or travel. I m very pleased with them, and have recommended them to others. 
14011 Excellent goodies for the price. 
14012 Th bag is so cute and fluffy, I loved it! 
14013 great transaction. Product as described 
14014 wish more quality clear camara 
14015 Great deal! 
14016 GOOD QUALITY 
14017 I want my money back, not worth the price. 
14018 The belt loop breaks fast. 
14019 This is the kit that goes with the camera, I bought for my granddaughter. She s had more fun, than I thought she ever would. She loves being able to add her own special creation to pictures. GOOD QUALITY!!! The case is super cute!!! 
14020 Perfect!!!! Love this Drone arrived on time as described 
14021 Batteries work great and the charger is a good addition. 
14022 This kit has the accessories I wanted at a reasonable price.. 
14023 Nice set of camera lens adapter rings. 
14024 I had problems with CD because it arrived broken. I do not know where get a new one. 
14025 Plugged in just as instruction said. About a minute after taking of lost all power and copter board caught on fire. Been flying for a year with no problems until I attached the camera 
14026 No issues !!!! 
14027 great 
14028 Nicely made product; works as advertised. Shipped/arrived on time. Thanks... jb 
14029 This product is excellent. Well made and exactly what I was expected. Delivery was excellent and no damage during transit. 
14030 Not great, not bad. You get what you pay for. 
14031 Freakin BEST camera bag EVERRRRR!!!! Love it sooo much!! Thank you, thank you! It s solid, fantastic and I have ZERO complaints :):) 
14032 Everything went fine 
14033 Easy to use, worked fine 
14034 Nice 
14035 Great bag!🎒 Got it for my boyfriend as a bday gift!👬❤️🎁🎉So much storage! Love the lime green accent color😍 perfect for hikes 🗻📷👌 and makes traveling on planes better✈️ 
14036 Arrived safely. Worked great for my trip to the zoo! 
14037 Very good 
14038 My husband the thrill seeker loves this chest mount! His GoPro was held securely while ziplining, mountain bike riding, and God knows what else he does :). Great buy, shouldn t be disappointed. 
14039 Perfect...just what I needed. 
14040 Work well! 
14041 The price is too much for too little 
14042 TERRIBLE, I bought this when i was at the beach. Then took it into the water and it was suppose to be so called &#34;waterproof&#34;. It wasn t and rusted then I was going to use it again and the pole popped right off and bent. 
14043 It s an amazing mount! I use it specifically for recording races and other events on my bike. It is extremely sturdy and well made! Totally would purchase again or recommend if anybody needs a mount for their GoPro! 
14044 Bough in November, 2014. After July, 2015, they charge about 2 hours of use (one bar). Enveloping plastic detaches from edge, which makes difficult to get battery out of camera. 
14045 This item was not working well.... Turned on the camera and I got pictured.. But the picture was blur like smudge ..... Not in good condition... 
14046 Good qualities and a great seller. 
14047 It must BUY item :) 
14048 No problems 
14049 Hi...Your timer you send to me is wonderful,i love it,thanks./. 
14050 Screen was completely backwards (clock, etc.) Sent it back. 
14051 this product was good quality and meant every one of my requirements 
14052 The unit arrived in good condition and everything was included as stated. Very good buy for all that you get. 
14053 excelent. 
14054 This was purchased quite some time ago and it is still holding up strong. I remember not paying a huge price on this and it has certainly served its purpose for my light needs. Lightweight, includes a storage bag. Collapses down pretty compact. 
14055 Extremely light and very well made for it s pricepoint. Have no worries mounting my 6D to it. Very compact and easy to travel with as well. 
14056 good material i like it. keeps my speed lights tight on those tripods 
14057 Works great. The turnover time from order to receipt was very short! 
14058 Great performance ! 
14059 Nice selection the product price was fantastic and the quality is very nice can wait to start posting videos 
14060 ok quality, did the job 
14061 These work great on glasses, iPhone, iPad, etc, and they are larger than similar products I have tried in the past. I would definitely recommend. 
14062 Works well- worth the money 
14063 No problems with the order at all. 
14064 Battery works great, and retains power very well. 
14065 The Charger is different than the picture and have just one dock for battery, the car charger is different too and is just for this charger and is not possible charge a ipad and iPhone at the same time because doesn t exist usb port.... 
14066 Excellent device. Has worked for me for many months. 
14067 Junk, send it back to China 
14068 I wear glasses and use a nice camera so these come in handy and are thicker than most I ve used. Very pleased. 
14069 Worked great! Fit perfectly in my Sony Cybershot W620. Happy with product and quick delivery. 
14070 We are trying to catch a car thief who stole my wife s car. He keeps coming back on our property to try again. We hope to catch him with one of these camera. 
14071 Not bad for price. 
14072 Like everyone else, the base of the arm broke on me after only a couple of uses. NOT WORTH WHAT YOU PAY FOR IT! 
14073 If you are a professional....stay away from this....I know...if professional should not be buying this in the first place...correct. If you were to purchase..install and never move or remove...could be alright...third time I removed...the whole entire right side tore from top to bottom...overpriced for what it is. bummer. 
14074 I bought the 2 camera system first, it worked so good, i purchased two additional cameras to add to the system. Simple to setup, record and maintain. I use it to monitor the home while away and it works. 
14075 Protects my camera from scratch and light bump. Portable n light. 
14076 Love it 
14077 Perfect replacement (and extra back-up) batteries for my Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX50 16.2 MP Digital Camera. 
14078 This is a hd camera and it perfect for inside. I had no problem with the install 
14079 Excellent camera; cheap goodies. 
14080 Works perfectly at a fraction of the cost. 
14081 These are really good stands! I use them with the NEEWER 160 LED CN-160 Dimmable Ultra High Power Camera Video Lights and it s a perfect combo. 
14082 So thrilled with this strap and the quality. Perfect for my Fujifilm instant camera! 
14083 It was easy to install take a little wild to reach me be it s work well 
14084 Optically, they re awesome. I can now bring nature and wildlife from afar to what seemingly appears to be within arms length. Great value and quality. 
14085 Perfect 
14086 Awesome and great price point! 
14087 Love this bag. It has been handy, and a great move up from my standard case. 
14088 The tripod is not stable. When I attached the selfie stick to the tripod, it tilted over and dropped. I would not recommend this product if you are looking for a tripod to hold the selfie stick for pictures and recording. 
14089 very good just wish it had an on when dark and off when light setting. the 4 or 8 hour option at dusk doesn t cover the entire night 
14090 Great batteries and charger!! fit perfect on my camera!! 
14091 Delivered on time. Good value 
14092 Nice quad-copter for the price. Software is easy to use. Resolution on the camera is pretty good. Easy to assemble the parts that are included. Very durable so far. I have even had it stuck in a tree one and retrieved it. It s fun to use! 
14093 Bon produit et livraison rapide 
14094 They work great 
14095 Besides the nostalgic look, this half case really improves the hand grip of the Df. It makes using longer zoom lenses and/or holding the Df for a prolong period of time much more comfortable. 
14096 Great! 
14097 Using it with a Sony action can, smooth rotation, good price, standard tripod mounts top & bottom 
14098 Well put together kits. Was given as a gift. She loves it 
14099 Great product, love it! 
14100 For the price you can do so much, yeah the screen and veiw finder is low res, but the image is not. 
14101 Worked for me. 
14102 I like the product. Its exactly what I´ve expected. And the personal letter sent by the manager of the company makes you feel really good and makes you feel you are buying a good and quality product. 
14103 Very clear picture 
14104 nice 
14105 great. 
14106 It took some trial and error, but it all works now as expected. 
14107 Quick Delivery and came as stated!! 
14108 Easy to setup, great audio, well worth its price, and extremely stable. I highly recommmend it!!! 
14109 I bought this devise to help me clean the inside of my sewing machine. It blows all the tiny threads and lint and is very helpful. The rubber feels strong when squeezed, so I feel confident that this product will last a long time. 
14110 Shipped promptly; was nicely packaged; fit the camera well. Seems to be high quality glass. 
14111 it is the fourth one I have purchased hoping it would work. its a hit and miss (with most MISS) also if I am lucky it records but can t play it on any of my computers 
14112 This camera worked great for two years. I used it in the Caribbean once and then the next day, the screen went black. It lasted almost exactly until the two year warranty wore off. :-( 
14113 Charged this battery upon arrival. Camera ran less than one minute and died. Not pleased at all. 
14114 ...Works perfectly. No complaints. 
14115 not part what I needed 
14116 Smaller then appears,good quality. 
14117 Perfect! Highly Recommended ☺ 5 ★ STARS ★ Thanks! A+ 
14118 Awesome! I had no problems installing it and it seems to hold a charge much longer than the old one. 
14119 Super easy to connect and works just like it s supposed to. Very fast delivery too! 
14120 Does what it says 
14121 This lens is absolutely wonderful. I thoroughly enjoy using it. 
14122 Looks very nice, Good Quality. 
14123 Purchased this months ago for spring break beach trip... used it through summer for pool adventures. Durable and great pics (lighting does matter) for the price of the camera. My boys take it away and I love watching the underwater videos that they come up with. 
14124 High quality images and video! I ll be making YouTube videos and such using it! Extremely easy to use with the phone app as well. I love taking it to the gym. 
14125 Works great 
14126 Keeps my GoPro visible and floating on top of the water! I love it! 
14127 Fantastic.. Easy to use. Well constructed. 
14128 I have not had a chance to use these yet, but I did test them out and they work fine. 
14129 Have bought Wasabi kits for several of my cameras. They all work flawlessly. 
14130 This is NOT a 500 watt light. It is 75 watts, equivalent to a 300 watt incandescent bulb. 
14131 The extension clasps are very hard to work especially if your hands are wet. 
14132 Just what I expected. Works well and both my kids and I can wear this snapped. It s a little bulky on the wrist strap but you definitely can t lose it. 
14133 Product arrived quickly and was as described. 
14134 Night time photographs do not show beyond 15 
14135 Pleased 
14136 A true five star product if it came with instructions. I would have gladly paid double the price for the inclusion of an instruction booklet with code examples and wiring charts. 
14137 Light weight tripod and it is still sturdy. Used in some windy conditions and had no trouble. 
14138 It does what it has to do. Ok. 
14139 These binoculars were too big for my use 
14140 Excellent tripod to get the job done 
14141 Scheduled for delivery on Sunday! Didn t think it would actually show up, but it sure did! Good quality, perfect for day trip, not meant to hold everything you own. I like the precut cutouts. 
14142 It is really expensive but I really loved how it worked with my polaroid 3500! 
14143 I love that I found this on here because no one sells this battery for my camera! It works great and i love the price I got everything for. 
14144 Very portable and easy to set up. We use it as a projector screen as well. 
14145 This camera far exceeded my expectations. The video is amazing and the photos my husband took of the moon were so clear I thought he had downloaded them off the internet to play a joke on me. The zoom was so amazing we could see the craters in the moon! 
14146 I absolutely love this camera. Takes amazing pictures and video underwater. I still use this camera to this day dont forsee getting a new one any time soon. 
14147 Works like a dream 
14148 They do the job well. Just watch out for the little slips on the ends, they tend to break off, if used a lot. 2 pairs of mine, have lost the ends so far, and they are non-usable after that. 
14149 Installed it and it worked, not sure what else I can ask for. 
14150 Focus range is so small that it s impossible to use even on a tripod. Seems to be clear enough that it might be a good lens but the focus is just too shallow. 
14151 Does what it s supposed to. A bit pricey to be made of paper. 
14152 Product works great. Price much lower than brand found in store. 
14153 I still haven t figured out how to set it up. No support. 
14154 The camera is fine but the on-board memory is pathetic, all but requiring the purchase of supplemental memory cards. Consider the memory card as a hidden cost when buying this camera. 
14155 Made my own Google Cardboard. These lenses did a great job and worked great. 
14156 My daughter is fascinated 
14157 Worked perfect with my Arlo security cameras. 
14158 Works well. It even comes with a car charger. Plus the two battery pack I bought with it means I won t be caught without battery power for my camera. 
14159 Hard cover to provide good protection. Ample space for essentials. 
14160 Great package deal! I love the camera 
14161 Amazing camera!!! 
14162 Basically an Eggtimer with cool graphics. No adjustable settings and the 1hr. limit and rotating speed made the timelapse seem rushed. the top also fell off. Not a great buy for $35 
14163 It was cracked. I took it into the water and it started to flood. Luckily I noticed it before it killed my go pro 
14164 first time for a digital camera. I have always had Canons. My lens from my Rebel 2000 also work on this one. Very happy easy to understand and download pictures onto computer. 
14165 Worked very well! 
14166 Arrived safely. Worked great for my trip to the zoo! 
14167 Bought this after a bit of a hunt through competing listings. This hit the sweet spot of wanting clear protective lenses with cap holders and not much more for my new Canon camera with an extra telephoto lens. Good price and very rapid delivery. Would use again. 
14168 Great color & pattern - interchangeable is the best! 
14169 It can only record for a maximum of 25 minutes. I bought it to record lectures but it s just sitting home now. The battery is not strong at all. 
14170 Recieved in timely manner. Very satisfied! Now able to enjoy watching my home movies! Thank you so much! 
14171 Love this - works well, even with Linux! 
14172 I love having these magic fiber towels on my office desk. I use it to clean my monitor, tablet screens, phone screens, and my keyboard which has a glossy finish. Highly Recommended! 
14173 Images have a strong magenta cast difficult to control even indoors. 
14174 does the job 
14175 Better than expected! 
14176 Smaller than I thought but well constructed and very useful for the photographer that needs an extra hand. It looks great on my Canon 40D. 
14177 Great product for a great price. Cant go wrong 
14178 Having fun with it! 
14179 Works perfect. Got it for my Grandmother. Super easy for all her kids and grand kids to send pictures. Easy to manage the account online from afar. 
14180 Excellent cameras. 
14181 works good when you aren t in the wind, already had one of my speed light stands break because of these but oh well that was my fault. 
14182 exactly as described. 
14183 Great quality glass on this pair of binoculars. 
14184 It s been good to transfer our slides to digital. Easy to use. 
14185 It s really awesome camcorder. 1080p is a steal for this price. I used it in Kauai for snorkeling and helicopter ride. It s priceless. I recommend this camera. 
14186 Offers great protection for my lens, easy to clean 
14187 Great wide angle lens that takes fabulous color! A must-have addition to your DSLR kit. 
14188 depth of field with small f-stops resolved! 
14189 Great price it does it s job. 
14190 Freezing to much on the app and i do have the faster business Internet at home. I restart the cameras 3 times already because it didn t work. 
14191 As advertised 
14192 Great product! 
14193 Does what it s supposed to do. Great cheap alternative from Amazon. 
14194 good 
14195 Works fine for the price. 
14196 so so~ 
14197 It s hard to beat Kodak s TMAX 100. 
14198 Never worked with iPhone. Now in junk drawer. 
14199 Ricardo John great service and great camera! awesome business 
14200 Did not really fit my Samsung NX mini which is the smallest nx camera samsung has for its mirrorless camera. The case did not leak at all. The case is meant for smaller point n shoot and not mirror less cameras which are slightly bigger. 
14201 Love it. 
14202 love the wide angle of the lens and image quality. I wished to purchase 14-24 mm based on reviews but happy with this lens now. 
14203 they work out and are very usefull 
14204 I can view the record directly from the APP, so good 
14205 I love it. it s a bit big but I am sure I will soon fill it with all kinds of gears. 
14206 Was not for your shoulder like it says and it is very short even for around your neck 
14207 Glad I chose this camera. One of the best ones out there for outside. 
14208 Poor quality even at this price. The float mount broke right away. The selfie stick is ok, but can be purchased alone and not in this kit. For use with my action cam in the water, I opted for the neomark wrist mount and was very pleased with it. 
14209 The camera was relatively easy to setup, and the picture quality is alright. The build in audio isn t the greatest, but it has ports to plug in your own speakers/ mic for the camera if you want better ones. I have not had any issues with the camera yet. 
14210 Good price. Ok batteries not as longest lasting as GoPro brand. At least you get two of them though and a nice dual charger. Nice to have backups. 
14211 Sucks. 
14212 Fast charging on the go. Nice for getting another flight in when you all you have is your car. No issues and I ve used it several times. 
14213 I just received the tripod and it is awesome! I love the bluetooth capabilities! 
14214 Great product 
14215 loose range quickly 
14216 I absolutely LOVE this!! Definitely gives me a more professional look!!! 
14217 very nice very nice to product especially to selfie loving people.it is an all in one and very handy to carry for holiday packers. can be recommendable. 
14218 Perfect fit for my larger tripod. 
14219 product as advertised, very good 
14220 It s made fairly well, but I expected a much higher level of quality if it was originally 79 dollars as stated. 
14221 Compact. Great quality. 
14222 gracias 
14223 Broke the first day..... 
14224 Works nicely! I also like that It comes with extra batteries, for use on vacation. 
14225 Batteries arrived in a timely manner and were just what I expected. 
14226 Great idea for taking better photos. Easy to use and adjustable so it fits my Samsung phone too. 
14227 Great shipping time, used this at church today to video the children s service with my daughter operating it with no problems! 
14228 Fits phantom 3 perfectly 
14229 great products. Thanks 
14230 Works great. On a full charge its only rated at about 8-10 minutes, but I have gotten 12 minutes out of a battery. 
14231 Didn t set it up wirelessly but so easy! 
14232 Love love love my Nikon camera. I have taken over 500 pics already and think I may have found may new calling. Very happy with this product. 
14233 Didn t like this. The case was too small for the GAlaxy2 camera and would sometimes turn the power on as you slid it into the case. May be ok for a smaller device. 
14234 Good for group shots you want to be in 
14235 This is awesome. If it came with a case or something I d give it 5 stars. 
14236 As described. Love the camera. Great pictures for an entry level photographer. Takes time to get used to the camera as a newbie and a lot of trial errors but I ll get used to it soon enough 
14237 This is a surprisingly good camera! Not quite five-star outstanding, but I am very, very happy with it. My family owns two now :- ) 
14238 Optic tubes were not aligned. Two discrete images with an angular separation both horizontally and vertically. This should have been discovered before shipping by simple inspection. Did not re-order. 
14239 Arrived PDQ and was as advertised, very happy with items so far. 
14240 Perfect for my eight year old, Instent gratification, we got through a pack of photos in an evening. Quality of the pictures is good. 
14241 All Great!!!! 
14242 This package includes far more than what you could find at other Big Box stores. It is a true bargain. 
14243 Crazy number of tiny parts to assemble and instructions were worthless. 
14244 I was extremely disappointed with this product. This product isn t durable enough for children. This was purchased for my son. He dropped it and it broke.... He was heart broken. It was money basically thrown in the garbage 
14245 Now I have a very disappointed child. 
14246 low quality photos 
14247 This works well and does everything I need. The camera setup was straight forward, configuring the firewall an DNS required more knowledge. 
14248 Worked fine 
14249 Good quality, delivery on time! 
14250 the film we got was outdated in 2008 pleas give me my money back 
14251 Yup. It s a photo album that holds 504 photos and yes, it s worth it. 
14252 Works great but very difficult to setup. Took two people 3 1/2 hrs. to finish setup, could not connect to my Apple MacBook Pro. 
14253 A must purchase battery and charger. 
14254 Works great and is a must have when using in the ocean so that you don t loose it. 4 stars because the price was a little high. You pay the extra money for the brand instead of for the material. I recommend buying from different distributor. 
14255 Total FAIL. Camera mount completely came apart and we lost our camera in the waves. Do NOT buy if you care about your camera 
14256 5 star 
14257 I love the texture, they are almost suede feeling. Those are the kind I love most because they remove debris and grease from my glasses and other lenses so much better, highly recommend! 
14258 Does the job. Does unravel itself but it still functions the same. 
14259 Good for just taking around what you need 
14260 Did the trick. Fixed tethering issues without adding power. 
14261 excellent product 
14262 With a newborn we wanted to capture the moments that were just to long to use the IPhone. This is easy to use and very compact. I really like how you do not need to remove the battery to charge it. Thanks 
14263 I really love my new camera! I wanted to get something that takes really nice pictures yet affordable so I was a little nervous on ordering this product since I have never had a Sony camera but I am absolutely happy with my purchase! It s takes great pictures! 
14264 Good product 
14265 Its perfect and very comfortable 
14266 -0 star junk THE END 
14267 gave as part of gift bag for someone with new Go Pro and they loved it! 
14268 Just received this lens cover 2 of them and they fit perfect and fit good feel sturdy and not loose like my other ones. If I continue to loose them will def be ordering more :) 
14269 Can not adjust the sense with this bag. Pictures look a bit blury. not that happy, but it was cheap. 
14270 Just what I needed. Very good for laptop and glasses! 
14271 Excellent! Thank you!! 
14272 This is NOT plug/play. It is plug/install an executable from china/play. It requires flash which is on it s last leg as software. This does not work with Blue Iris software. You cannot play the video without installing their software. 
14273 No comments 
14274 Buy it or lose your gopro. 
14275 Price was right. Only used a few so far and they seem OK, but I m not yet sure. 
14276 Love it. 
14277 Solid tripod. With the right adapter it holds my iPhone 6 perfectly. 
14278 Camera great, servive fair but has gotten better 
14279 Ordered it and it came in a reasonable time. The strap is great and feels comfy on my neck. The look and feel of it is also amazing as well. I ll definitely be buying more straps from here in the future. Thanks again! 
14280 as expected...hated the short and non-microusb cable for charging 
14281 Bought as a gift for my Nephew. He liked it. 
14282 Ok for a gift! 
14283 Great price! Came fast ! 
14284 It seems to work as advertised 
14285 Excellent alternative to tracking down a factory battery for the early generation gopros. I have a Hero2 with a WiFi &#34;bacpack&#34; and the battery lasts just as long as my brand new hero4 black. 
14286 got here in nothing flat.. excellent!! 
14287 very good system 
14288 Thank you! 
14289 Inexpensive replacement battery, seems to work as good as the original. 
14290 Ended up keeping since the return shipping would make it a wash. NOTE: There are NOT 50 LEDs as claimed in the description- just one blinking red light. Meh 
14291 Fits everything you can use!!! 
14292 It s just personal preference...nothing really against the product. 
14293 Very satisfied with this purchase. The payment and shipping went very smoothly and quickly. 
14294 This bag is great for the Nikon D7100, my dad loved it for his birthday! It also came just in time for our Colorado trip 
14295 Great little cleaning kit, although the plastic bag it came in fell apart as I took it out of the box. 
14296 These are great IP cameras for around the house. They can FTP snap shots or video to any FTP server. 
14297 It s ok....the screw is crap it won t screw in anymore it s a good thing the go pro came with extras...if you want to use it for the outside of a car I recommend the actual gopro suction cup... 
14298 This is exactly the same as the original and charges the battery great! 
14299 Fit good on my nikon d7100, if not placed correctly it comes out in the picture, but then u rotated it an it was no longer in the way of the pictures 
14300 Love the metal mount on this product. Really dosen t add weight to the mask. 
14301 This product replacement! My security system battery died unexpectedly and this worked just as well. I expect it to last many years to come. 
14302 Works perfectly to connect my Olympus camera to my PC so that I can save photos to my computer. 
14303 Was for the Camera 
14304 Love the quality and look of the case! The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because although manufacturer claims it will fit a Canon Powershot SX60 camera, IT DOES NOT! If that is what you have, I would not recommend you ordering this product. 
14305 Bought this as a gift for my mother in law before she left for the family reunion. I figured it would be good for the group shots. I think she enjoyed it. 
14306 Amazing camera! And this bundle is quite the bargain. I should know. I shopped around for two months and this is by far the best deal. Shipped quickly and packaged very well. Highly recommend this product and this seller. 
14307 Price is right. Easy setup initially. Trouble getting sound from two separate computers. Tech help said it was computers fault. Both computers? Works fine on I phone. Now I can t even get a picture on those computers. Hate to invest hours in tech support. 
14308 Well worth the price! I like the removeable head. 
14309 Not very durable didn t work very long 
14310 Works well.Note it is the same adapter as the Kenko Teleplus 2X 7 element for Nikon AF, the 2 are the same inside, identical aside from brand name and minor cosmetic differences. Save a few $. 
14311 Very good protection that is sized for specific Sony lenses. This one is sized for the SELP1650 
14312 It does the job 
14313 I can t wait to use this thing on all my adventures. Came with charger, case, battery, and attachment for the case. 
14314 Very cheaply made, and cannot even figure out how to use it (no, it isn t simple at all -- actually has two pieces. Huh? Just another lesson in purchasing on the cheap. 
14315 The cameras work very well on the FPV plane and has a very clear picture, The seller was very prompt in getting the cameras out and to me 
14316 I did not receive the product shown in the pictures. Very dissatisfied right now 
14317 Great 
14318 Good quality. Good light. Very easy to assemble. I wish there was a simpler method to rotate the softbox from portrait to landscape. Overall, a great product at a great price. 
14319 Perfect! 
14320 Show a great pic..just had a line on one side, this was suppose to be a new item, but I think it was a use item, maybe or maybe not..but great pic on oneside. 
14321 Loved it 
14322 Worked like a charm! Thank you 
14323 Well built easy to open & close ,i play inside with my nikon 7100 with 18-200 no probleme very sturdy, next i try in the field,that would be the test,I have a larger & heavier $600.00 tripod this dolica would be easier to hike with. 
14324 DON T WASTE YOUR TIME BUYING THIS! NO INSTRUCTIONS AND ALL THE PARTS WEREN T INCLUDED. 
14325 The filter is quality made at a reasonable price. I use filters primarily to protect the expensive lenses that they are attached to from dust and debris. 
14326 Just not loud enough! 
14327 I am having such a great time using my new camera. Came with a dvd with tips on it for us amateurs to get a leg up. Awesome value 
14328 It would ve been 5 I ve stars if it wasn t 5 days late but it s a good product 
14329 Ok 
14330 I am happy with the product as well as shipment on time. 
14331 I use this product on my house because my neighbor is damaging my property and what better way to catch him with out having to go to extremes. I hope he keeps doing it. Great buy. .. 
14332 Fast shipping, great price! 
14333 broke after about 6 months. I used it about 3 times within those 6 months :( 
14334 Had to fuss with it for quite awile to get it paired with my SmartThings hub. No complaints once getting through the pairing process. 
14335 great 
14336 Pictures didn t turn out the way they were supposed to, and it only came with 8 pieces of film. Not worth almost $28 in my opinion. 
14337 I bought this to go with my Polaroid camera. But whats so cool is that it works with any cellphone or tablet. YOu can print memorable photos instantly. This is great especially for vacation which I will be going on next week. So excited. 
14338 cool. 
14339 Excellent seller recommend 100% 
14340 Fabulous. Works like a charm! 
14341 fit perfectly! 
14342 Easy to take a photo of me! 
14343 The quallity its very poor, i prefer at least 1080p of resolution. Another important thing is the angle camara, with gopro i had 170 degrees and with brinno only 14p0 
14344 love it 
14345 This provides serious protection for your camera. The fit is nice, and there are openings in strategic places for connections. The only downside is that manipulating the cover can be a bit tedious. The snaps work well, holding everything together, and yet are reasonably easy to open and close. 
14346 Really like the camera. The only problem is keeping my hand away from area when flash pops up. Easy to charge and take pics. 
14347 beats replacing a perfectly good camera 
14348 Ordered several. Wide angle lenses are great and worth the $7.95 each alone. However, the fish-eye lenses are blurry, not because of foreign matter or scratches (lenses are clear and smooth), but just the way they were made (they were all the same) 
14349 I live in a very hot area, the glue loosens from the back and the adapter (and the attached lenses/filters) falls off of the camera... what a waste of money, useless 
14350 AMAZING THIS TRIPOD IS VERY NICE, GOOD STILL, LIGHT WEIGHT NICE DESING IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SAMM TIPOD THIS IS THE BEST CHOISE 
14351 I ve been using this camera for years and it s still going strong. 
14352 Great camera - takes good pictures with enough pixels to get good quality. 
14353 nice kit at the right price 
14354 Great deal. good quality lens for our Canon DSLR and great items given with. 
14355 Works great. Fits my iPhone 6 perfectly. 
14356 Excellent dslr viewfinder. Comfortable on the eye, easily removable. The rail kit is also handy for adding other accessories or weight to your rig. 
14357 Already have some. These last longer than the battery that came with the camera, I get ~250 stills with these. I always carry a spare. The deal where you get two batteries plus a charger is a good one, already have that so I just got the battery this time. 
14358 perfect 
14359 Nice little dash cam. Works very well. 
14360 Daughter loved it ,great for party favors fast ship quality item 
14361 I read the reviews on this tripod and am happy to say it works great, easy to wrap around just about anything or stand on anything and with my Canon Rebel T31 it works great. 
14362 This attractive bag holds my Sony A7 w/ kit lens with room to spare. With the extender open, it will hold my Sony A7 with a Minolta MD 70-210 F4. Works great for carrying around a camera a single lens. Arrived in great condition and on time. 
14363 Great! 
14364 Works great. Can image for 4 min with my camera unguided. 
14365 Fit perfectly 
14366 Just the best seller! Cable was perfect as is this seller! 
14367 Daughter loves it. 
14368 Great little tripod for the price. However the first one I received was defective -- the camera wouldn t attach properly and it was missing a tightener screw. 
14369 pictures are so tiny you can t see it clearly,so I ll return it 
14370 THANKS I BROUGHT TO HAVE AN EXTRA ONE,AND IT WORKS JUST GINE,AND COST WAS GREAT 
14371 Great buy. Worth the investment. Extras are awesome!!!! 
14372 Just as described 
14373 Expect two different packages one with just the pipes and the second with the base plates. 
14374 After moderate use, the belt attachment is tearing from the case. Otherwise, it s a very good case. 
14375 I really loved these lights. Had two of them. Eventually the battery cells wore down and the light only lasts a few minutes at most. 
14376 Battery did not hold a charge, was unchargable so I returned it for a refund 
14377 excellent 
14378 Pretty sure I could come up with a smarter design. It s so oddly designed. I ll be losing the brass fittings sooner or later guaranteed. 
14379 Love the camera. The speaker and mic don t work as well as I d like, but i can overlook that. The subscription price seems a little high. 
14380 good camera 
14381 I love this little case I got for my camera. Debating on purchasing one for my daughter. Nice material and print is just gorgeous. 
14382 Great pack! Now just the camera cost $499, the Wasabi Batteries cost $23.99 and Lexar 32GB card is $24.99. 
14383 good quality 
14384 So far-all is well. Takes me awhile to figure out all the buttons, seems to be perfect. Took it kayaking with me and didn t have to worry about getting it wet... 
14385 Awesome value for money, it breathed new life into our Canon SL1 (which has a rather pathetic battery)... all the extra add-ons were a nice touch and, but really you are getting two good batteries and a backup charger. 
14386 Fantastic camera package for the price. All items listed were in box. Brand new unused. No issues. All parts fitted perfectly. Camera is amazing. Shipping was amazing. Definitely great service. Thank you Celltime ! 
14387 After one month of use it restart with no obvious reason at random time 
14388 Super Clear! 
14389 only one battery of the 2 worked for me 
14390 It is a big disappointment,it worked just during installation with good audio and Vedic but late the audio turned to one way traffic. The outdoor will hear you but you can t hear from indoor. It is a wast of money.Video picture is great and clear.This product needs improvements. 
14391 Takes good photos and has everything a casual camera user like me would need. The menu navigation is awkward and slow and I ve had difficulty getting it synced up over WiFi to my phones and desktop. 
14392 Great camera! Easy to use. Fast efficient shipping. No complaints! 
14393 Super easy to use. It feels sturdy even when it is fully extended and it holds my Samsung Note 2!! I took it with me on an out of state trip and it fit nicely in my carry on. Great price too. 
14394 Greate lense 
14395 Use this all the time. Great range and better than the standard remote that came with my camera. Be sure to keep extra batteries because it is easy to leave it on and the batteries not work. For $30 you will not find a better accessory for your camera!! 
14396 So happy, they work great and give me a long life for my camera. 
14397 The charger didn t work. Plus it didn t come with a lens. 
14398 Wasabi batteries never let me down. Good quality at a reasonable price. They are my &#34;go to&#34; batteries 
14399 Provably the best that I have used and properly priced too. 
14400 I have never been disappointed by Tiffen quality. Would and have recommend Tiffen filters... 
14401 Nice case. Neatly stores all of the GoPro accessories in a padded area with snug compartments for each accessory which prevents them from just rolling around in the case. Nice upper storage area on top of the case inside as well for additional items. 
14402 Love it 
14403 Henry did a great job with helping me solve my issue with camera , and got me up and running 
14404 Great camera, no complaints other then there being no memory card included. 
14405 I liked this bag so well, I bought one for my best friend. Well-designed and tough. 
14406 Performs as advertised. 
14407 Everything was great, timely delivery. 
14408 Husband absolutely loves this camera! 
14409 Cheap. 
14410 Works perfectly for my Canon Rebel T5i 
14411 is ok but not really impressing that much. i was hoping for more changes in the picture..... 
14412 too much flexible, dificult to remove the bubbles 
14413 Great quality and much more cost effecitve solution than the OEM. 
14414 works with my Nikon D200. 
14415 Works great. I can finally use my Polaroid camera again 
14416 Fantastic filter. High transmission. No decker able color cast. Very thin. Does not bind on lens. I d love to replace all my filters with these. 
14417 Excellent! 
14418 Great 
14419 Very good kit. 
14420 nice 
14421 Much better options available. Not very solid 
14422 Cute little photo album. It s not the best quality, but I bought it for my 9 year old and she doesn t notice things like that. If she wanted another one I would buy it again for her. 
14423 it is really fun and easy to control however the battery life is bad it well give you 2 to 5 min max and it take about 2 hours to charge 
14424 My old cable and power supply was giving me trouble so when got this seems to be working as stated in the ad with no trouble so far 
14425 Item is made out of plastic, it arrived broken. Should be made of something sturdier or shipped better. Nice idea though. 
14426 Amazing 
14427 This item was fantastic, fit perfectly, and just as described. The seller was great. Absolutely no complaints! 
14428 I could not use it with my camera, but the product was as advertised. Returned with no problem. 
14429 Nice sharp lens to compliment my D5200. Pictures look sharper than my older 18-105. Love the size because with the D5200 it makes for a very compact grab and go camera. 
14430 Camera did not wow me built quality ok video quality not great very user friendly one of the easiest I have set up over all good for basic around the house surveillance not great on detail pixels 
14431 Too small and rip apart too easily 
14432 Work fine Gets the job done 
14433 love my strap! tho the thread came out a little, I just cut it off a bit. 
14434 i continue to buy more. these work great. 
14435 This is a good, durable case for the RX cameras. It also has an extra pocket for a memory card. I have an RX-100ii camera which is an excellent little camera to bring on a vacation. 
14436 Great camera quality and value! I opened it up and played with it for a while to try out all of the different settings. It is easy to use and takes great pictures! I would definitely recommend this camera! 
14437 I use this on a Fujifilm X-E2 for the large handful of vintage M42 lenses that I own. It has a substantial feel to it and it just works as advertised. 
14438 Great product. 
14439 A+ 
14440 DSTE is the best non OEM grip out there period! I ve tried 3 others and this grip is by far better. The build is spot on with the OEM and all buttons/knobs work just like the OEM. The seller shipped fast from China and it arrived 8 days early. 
14441 Impossible to set up. Do not waste your time. 
14442 Works great just the right fit! 
14443 Very useful. 
14444 Had to return it the first time because the battery was not charging (after waiting more than a month for the camera to be delivered). The second camera I received is ok, but my phone takes better pictures. 
14445 Great lens! 
14446 Ok 
14447 good to have! 
14448 perfect to keep an eye on my bbq pit tempature guage from inside the house. 
14449 I purchased this for my son s rehearsal dinner. I tested and it took great pics. I liked it so much I purchased twice as much film as needed. I also purchased the little lens for selfies/close-ups. I may buy another camera! 
14450 Great 
14451 Excelent , 
14452 Works excellent for the money. Great starter copter 
14453 Good action cam. But no sound on videos unless you play it back on a VLC player. They should really update the codec for this device. Very annoying to have to find all sorts of work around (ie downloading codec etc) do deal with the no sound issue. 
14454 The lens hood interferes with the camera lens by obtrusively vignetting the view and thus the photos. I can t think of any situation in which I would find this product of any value. 
14455 FotoTech is great! Great products and service. 
14456 Arrived quickly, all the parts advertised were there and I got what I asked for. What more could I want? 
14457 Works great, covers all the entry points that I needed 
14458 Works perfectly 
14459 incredible bag! I can fit 4 film cameras in here, one tlr, one 6x4.5 medium format, one 35mm rangefinder and my 35mm slr! 
14460 Wow, this is a fantastic value. Works like it should at 1/5 the price. So far I m very impressed. 
14461 I do not recommend this brand. I bought it because they used it at work and while the quality looks okay it goes on and off all the time 
14462 Ok 
14463 nice --dated now of course but a very nice camera, 
14464 Photos are not clear otherwise it is fun 
14465 This product is awesome. It works perfectly fine. And the design gives it a better look than the regular slick one. Definitely recommend!!! 
14466 Soft at f3.5, more sharp around f8. Still the best APSC fish eye out there. 
14467 Works good 
14468 on time...worked 
14469 Love the way the legs expand and clamp into place. Clamps on the legs work much better than the ones you twist. My old one with the twist mechanism on the legs was forever slipping back down. 
14470 I have had limited use so far but I really like it. It holds my d750 very well. For the price you can t beat it. 
14471 Mine didn t work. I feel like these were overstocks with batteries long dead. No amount of charging time made any difference. On the plus side, Amazon refunded my money promptly 
14472 Takes good pictures, makes a good second camera 
14473 I got the first version.. Great but magnets fall out and it s annoying.. Can t seem to find a way to fix it 
14474 Very small and it broke within weeks. 
14475 works great 
14476 Great heavy duty mount 
14477 Great! 
14478 Seems too small. 
14479 Very good. 
14480 I don t understand Japanese/ no english directions to be read, nor pictorial instructions. I have returned the camera to Essex for credit card credit. 
14481 Met every expectation... Couldn t be happier with results 
14482 Fits, as one would expect 
14483 Wonderful! Charged quickly and last longer than the batteries that came with the camera, well done! 
14484 This cam works pretty well. The video quality is average but the price is right for a decent outdoor cam. Unfortunately I had 2 of these fail. They just stopped working completely. Pyle customer service was great and got me a new camera within a week. 
14485 I congratulate them for their excellent speed 
14486 I like it. 
14487 Costs more but is the perfect fit for your 50mm f1.8 STM -- and it reverses perfectly to fit into the camera bag -- cheap ones don t do that reliably. It also protects the lens front element with no optical impact. 
14488 Fast delivery. Batteries work as advertised 
14489 I purchased this video camera as a gift for my daughter. She loved it. 
14490 Amazing camera (love it!!), fast delivery and great customer service! 
14491 Battery is exact replacement needed, Excellent price and service. Recommend it for anyone who needs a batter for the SONY. 
14492 it did not look like what picture shows , in the picture it has the thing for attach to tripot but one I received dose not has one 
14493 you need to change the picture or send same thing as picture shows 
14494 No surprises. Everything as expected. 
14495 No problems. Works as expected. 
14496 It didn t fit my Samsung NX2000 like it said it should it was way too small. Also They didn t refund my whole amount of money they just refunded me $6 out of the $17 I paid. The case was very nice just wish it fit my camera. Bummed!!! 
14497 Came just as it looks. Vert sturdy. Love it! 
14498 Most completely satisfied including the price. Just right in every respect! 
14499 Nice colors -- thick substantial float 
14500 Great gimbal head for the price ! 
14501 Works well. I like the build quality. Easily screws onto my lens without binding. 
14502 I gave up as it was too hard to hook up with comcast 
14503 battery contacts are intermittent -- I think I can fix it, but at first I thought it was DOA 
14504 Works as expected. 
14505 Much nicer than the G1W. Setup is easy and does its job well. 
14506 Perfect for what I NEEDED it for. I absolutely love it. Works great.....Fast Shipping. 
14507 Good buy！Arrived on time. Works with no issues. Set up pretty quickly and haven t had any problems so far. Excellent baby monitor！ 
14508 Expensive but decent lens. Good for beginner. 
14509 The Camera works fine. However, Fuji download software is out of date and I cannot download pictures to my windows 10 software on my computer. I have contacted Fuji about this matter 
14510 I got these on Prime Day at a great price. I ve used them a few times and they work great! I ve taken some awesome photos with them. They fit perfectly in my amateur home studio. 
14511 Bought these for backup for my wife s Canon camera. They worked great. Held charge as long as the original. 
14512 This so small ... yet so cute!!! Works great!!! 
14513 great 
14514 Flies well, but so light that wind will take it as it goes above the trees. Easy to control unless windy 
14515 Good stuff 
14516 The octopus stand broke upon unpacking. I recommend sanding down the parts so they have better grip/friction. 
14517 Excellent product. Arrived quickly through Prime program. Well packaged. Worth the extra price over the generics, which I have tried & found to be worth what I paid for them, i.e. not much. 
14518 Batteries have lasted in this unit over a moth now in pouring rain for a month here in FL as still going good. Would recommend 
14519 It s not bad for the price, however, this was purchased before I fully conceded to the fact that in order to get a good solid tripod you ve got to spend some money. 
14520 cvi quality is awesome can zoom in with the right cameras. 
14521 awesome grip! 
14522 Was great..... And then it fell apart. I could tell it wasn t that sturdy and I m a little frustrated that it didn t last more than three gigs. 
14523 Lens cover gets scratched very easily. Great price though. 
14524 Works great! No issues communicating with my D600. 
14525 The kit itself is amazing comes with everything an amateur GoPro photographer would want. Anyway, very satisfied with this kit!For me 5 stars definitely. 
14526 Work good, easy to set up. The quality of the video could be better and the user interface isn t the easiest to use but all in all it s ok. 
14527 Purchased for a trip we took to St.Croix. It was perfect for the flight and sightseeing around the island. Loved it! 
14528 The s mirrors are useless. They constantly move even though I strapped them very tight to the handlebar and also tightened the small bolt that holds the unit together. 
14529 perfect fit, had it on for awhile and i forget it is even on there. 
14530 Well built cameras work well 
14531 I received the new item pretty quickly and in fine working order. 
14532 Great product. Only con I have with this is the tightening of the ball joint can be tight as it will go and still move in some positions. (Depends on how steep an angle you are at). Otherwise, great for smaller cameras 
14533 ie: Mobius cam. 
14534 Love this filter and it has helped a lot with my travel photography. Fits perfectly. You do have to be careful because it can get stuck, but you just have to make sure you are twisting the filter and not the lens. Highly recommend. 
14535 works great 
14536 I have not taken any serious photos with this lense yet. It seems to be very good at the very least. I did my research on this and this lens is recommended over the 10-24 Nikon lense. http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/10-24mm.htm 
14537 Great 
14538 Super cute and pretty easy to use! 
14539 Came on time and we used it for an important magazine shoot, awesome 
14540 Great product and prompt shipment! Thanks!! 
14541 Cheap and weird. Holds to the camera and lens well enough, but latch is sloppy. One screw interferes with the lens and had to be removed, and another screw broke off completely. Good machining quality and price, but be prepared to rework it a little to fit your lens. 
14542 Item as described, fits on the new speedlite I just purchased. 
14543 They work and are a big upgrade from the previous extension tubes that I had which did not allow for auto focus to work. 
14544 It works. I have bene using it for about a week now. The color makes it easier to find if you lose it in the water. 
14545 does what it does, cheap plastic but it s cheap cost too, works well. 
14546 Everything works perfectly love this product! 
14547 Love these cloths. I use them for my reader glasses, PC screen, and expensive camera lenses. They do a great job! 
14548 Kind of cheaply built but will do the trick and priced right 
14549 I love these flashes!! 
14550 Great! Very pleased! 
14551 Great sturdy bag, 
14552 Looks great and is very well made 
14553 Works as advertised and the compact tripod is a travel favorite for me. 
14554 Perfect!!! 
14555 i was really excited to use this, but it came broken. I changed the batteries three times and nothing. 
14556 This had all the items i need. I love to take pictures, and selfies with fam are difficult. NOT ANYMORE 
14557 Works great 
14558 Great accessory 
14559 Just opened my package, and am very satisfied with my new camera bag! Fits the camera perfectly, along with plenty of room for my charger, SD cards, and my new USB cable. Very pleased with this purchase! 
14560 Fast shipping and quality product. 
14561 Excellent!!! 
14562 Fantastic product. Brilliant lens. Very pleased with the results. 
14563 Very good for the price 
14564 Fast delivery. Product is as described. 
14565 No quite as easy to set up as &#34;plug and play&#34; depending on your modem, but once it is set up, this is a good product. The picture quality isn t bad, and the night views are pretty good. Easily accessed through the Foscam App on my smart phone. 
14566 It does work. It does not make your lens a macro lens but allows it to focus at a closer distance. 
14567 Great security system with a many features and backed by outstanding technical support. 
14568 Love this camera! I m able to check on my little one anytime. There is a bit of a delay but not terrible. 
14569 My first flash kit for my first DSLR camera. Easy to operate and produces excellent flash photos. 
14570 Worth the price 
14571 Case is nice and helps protect my daughters camera. 
14572 Stronger and bigger than other ones that I ve bought. Hopefully, this one will not crack soon. 
14573 Great quality better then I expected and very functional while still protecting my camera. 
14574 I bought these for my husbands birthday and he is a bit concerned that they will not be good for long range viewing.....anyone have input on this please? 
14575 Just as described--and just what I needed--with perfect shipping! Thanks so much! 
14576 Excelent product 
14577 It does exactly what it says it will, it fits the vast majority of filter sizes, and it s not irritatingly bulky. Arrived promptly, and seems quite study, especially considering the price point. So far, so good. 
14578 It does the job. It s lightweight and feels flimsy, and doesn t have the best tactile feedback for the button... but for the price, what do you expect? Works fine with my Pentax K-50. 
14579 Necessary if using GoPro in water! 
14580 Very happy with this camera and all of the extras that came with it. Great value for the price. 
14581 Not the greatest 
14582 It works for what I needed. Fits in the bag I bought. 
14583 Great camera! Got this for a trip to Key Largo. Beautiful video. We dove to about 40 feet with no issues. Pictures are &#34;okay&#34; under water, but video is great. Wish it was a 2 inch screen, but the 1.5 inch does the job. Easy to use and operate. 
14584 The release lever has troubles and the aperture ring isn t so smooth, but it s workable. 
14585 Precisely what I wanted. 
14586 1. Super simple to set up 2. Love the wide angle lens, captures my entire apt 3. Very small, can fit anywhere 
14587 Exactly as advertised. It works fine. Received it sooner than expected. No concerns. 
14588 Item is as good as offered ... Thanks 
14589 I love this camera! Love the wifi feature! Very handy when wanting to instantly post your excelllent photos! Arrive in great time! 
14590 Works exactly as described,very easy to setup.i will buy it again. 
14591 Perfect, even sturdier than the original! 
14592 Everything you could want, plus more. Very happy with purchase! 
14593 Cord is too short... 
14594 Beautifully crafted accessory that greatly enhances the hold-ability of the camera. Makes one handed shooting so easy! Cannot imagine the camera without it. 
14595 Everything I could need for my new camera. 
14596 Works perfectly for my needs. If you have a professional camera that weighs a few pounds I would recommend you brace this stand a little. 
14597 Good camera. Lots of features. A little flimsy. 
14598 WORKS GREAT!! 
14599 Got this to use my Nikon mount Lensbaby on my Fujifilm X-T1. I was honestly surprised at how well made it is. For the price, I was expecting something that felt pretty cheap, but this is a solid piece of gear. Love it. 
14600 GoPro better watch out! I have used both now and this $50 Geekpro is more user friendly and with the screen, who needs WiFi. I have shown this to others and all will buy Geekpro from here on. 
14601 Very cool 
14602 Their firmware updating and process is crap. Software outdated. 
14603 Great piece for camera, thank you 
14604 I have a Nikon 5300 and this doesn t come close to fitting. Pretty disappointing. 
14605 Easy for my children to use while snorkeling and pictures came out very nice. 
14606 This fits great and saved me lots of money. Since I ll probably lose it again, I m glad I know where to find a sturdy replacement! 
14607 Great product, great price, fast shipper. 
14608 A must have 
14609 This is a great slide and negative scanner. I needed to scan 240 negatives that I wanted to digitize and put on a CD. This unit was easy to use and I was able to complete the job in about an hour. 
14610 It works like it is suppose to... Great! 
14611 Good stuff fast shipping 
14612 ok 
14613 One attachment worked. Nine wouldn t attach to the GoPro because the slots didn t line up. I must have gotten a bad batch. 
14614 got this for my 3 year old great nephew and he is in love with it, now he doesn t need to use my camera, he really enjoys taking pictures, made a perfect birthday present 
14615 My concern was the battery and after 2 months, it s still almost full even with the sensor on outside the gate. Setup was easy and fast. Connections are good. 
14616 Working great 
14617 Not bad! 
14618 As Advertised. 
14619 love it , awesome 
14620 for my cropped body camera 35mm lens acts as 50mm lens .I am using on D5300. i needed 50mm so purchased 35mm. 
14621 got this on prime day for my dad. takes great pictures in all level of light. very easy to use. for about same price as a point and shoot camera, this one tops with more features and controls 
14622 Works great. I wish it would lock out of the way better (when not using the filter), but otherwise works just as expected. 
14623 I do like the size of this camera very much but it just doesn t perform nearly as well as my other Nikon but then my other Nikon is in a whole another category price wise. Over all it s an okay camera. 
14624 It s my first camera and it is so cool. 
14625 I received the camera and didn t open right away cause it was a gift. When it was opened it didn t work. Still haven t heard back from them. 
14626 This is the best strap I have owned. It is secure, and very fast/easy to use. Keeps the camera handy and mounts to the proper mounting lug on the camera. 
14627 DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE. 
14628 Fast shipping, great product! 
14629 there is nothing else like it, perfect 
14630 as described 
14631 Too awesome. Must HAVE! !! 
14632 Takes good pictures. Perfect for trips where one does not want to take a full size camera. Ideal for vacations and complimentary to photos taken on smart phones 
14633 don t really stay on the visor, depends how thick your visor is... not working on mine. 
14634 Makes macro shots with these cameras even better 
14635 Good ribbon cable! 
14636 Very nice. 
14637 This case worked perfect for my GoPro 3+ 
14638 The products that I did receive work great, but the body mount and extension pole were not included. 
14639 Awesome little camera. I like the features and definitely the price. Need to practice a little with the app and order back up batteries for my longer motorcycle rides. 
14640 Thanks! 
14641 Great lens in great shape 
14642 This is a great camera. The product arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Unfortunately it broke after the first set of film. Trying to figure out how to fix it or if I should just buy another one. 
14643 Work Great Hold better than original cannon lens cover 
14644 This was a fantastic deal for an exceptional camera. I m absolutely thrilled to have this. I highly recommend taking advantage of this deal before they run out!!!! 
14645 Didn t get a chance to use it but after all the alarms I checked, this is the only one that resets itself and it gets tripped off. A plus for people who go on vacation. 
14646 Great, provides protecting for a camera, the only down side is it can t hold extra lens, which is more my fault for not reading the description. I ended up give it to my father, who works outdoors a lot, and he absolutely loves it. 
14647 Just what I needed 
14648 This camera works really good in the dark. It has amazingly good night vision. I like the size of it and I like how easy it operates. I received this item for a honest review. 
14649 Its a nice case but is too small for the Sony RX100M4 even though it is advertised as being for that camera. The camera does not slip easily into the case. Two stars because of the poor fit. 
14650 Works great for the camera without battery grip holder and bigger lens but would not buy it if you like to leave those on your camera. 
14651 The screws on the light stands broke after the first use and the light bulbs were not as bright as I expected them to be. You get what you pay for I guess. I would ve returned it, but one of them fell over and the light bulb broke. 
14652 Good camera system. Simple to install 
14653 Item was as described and received quickly 
14654 The order arrived in good time. Very pleased. 
14655 This is a great product. I felt so safe with it on the camera I even let the young kids use it while we were on the boat! 
14656 Perfect size, but a little bulky. Small enough, but big enough to fit batteries, charger and a slot for one SD chip. Wish it had smaller handle option and can remove larger strap option. 
14657 work great. good to have. 
14658 1 year later and these cameras have become part of our everyday life, being able to see what is going on outside is really nice especially when getting packages delivered! 
14659 You gotta be kidding me! This lens is EXCELLENT. Could not be happier. 
14660 It s nice and long. The only thing is there is a separate button that you hold to take a photo. I wish it was on the stick itself. Love the extra holder for go pro and other cameras 
14661 Package was received opened and reclosed and without the product. 
14662 When I finally received the whole kit, it was Great!!! 
14663 Exactly as described. Good deal! Works great. Thanks 
14664 they seem to hold better than the original battries 
14665 Thinking about returning. Don`t like the way it looks when you look into them. 
14666 I bought 2 of this. This is perfect for my video projects. I used to carry around with me a heavy one attached to another heavy battery pack. Not anymore! 
14667 Very happy with this case. I strapped it to my backpack pads on a week long trip and it protected my new camera and made it accessible for quick shors. Didn t really get on my way, either. Good product. 
14668 The umbrella has a very weak metal. it only lasted a few sessions. Somehow the metal twisted in a way I could never untwist again. Broken now. 
14669 for budget consumers, this tripod from Ravelli will be the best choice because of its durability and reliability while on the job 
14670 very good 
14671 Took it on our vacation and lasted as long as the original Canon battery that came with the camera. Good product. 
14672 Perfect condition works great. Not exactly like pictured. Newer model 
14673 I had to return it 2x for the same problem over the span of 3 days, unreliable. 
14674 poor quality it SUCKS!!! 
14675 Good as expected 
14676 Went right together with no cutting. 2 thumbs up 
14677 Product isn t the best quality but it works. 
14678 Es muy buen producto 
14679 Lovable to use either at home or in a car! Simple but very sufficient to charge. I like cloth, too! 
14680 perfect fit 
14681 works well 
14682 Quite obsolete now, better get a GoPro 
14683 As Expected 
14684 Fits LCD screen perfectly as described 
14685 My Grandchildren our having a great time flying the drone. 
14686 mine will not charge any of my 3 batteries. they fit fine in the charging port but they will not charge and no light comes on. what do i do. 
14687 Absolutely love this lens!! The photos I have taken came out fantastic! Have a taken quite a few pictures of grandchildren and I must say, this lens makes me look like I really know what I m doing! 
14688 seems fine 
14689 It s been a great camera. Very easy to use. We really like the zoom. 
14690 Very easy to set up and start using right away. Great features and a real value for the price. 
14691 Excellent! 
14692 Fantastic binocs. Light weight. Easy to use. Focuses up close and far away. Love it! 
14693 Arrived on time also came with two minor cracks, based on the reviews i was worried of quality... But shows perfectly 
14694 Perfectly functional cleaning cloths, though they seem to be of different types of cloth... 
14695 Great item to control tripod lights.. 
14696 I was using the macro ring flash, the macro lens and my canon camera for my profesional dentistry practice. Works great, fine quality pictures. Very usefull in my dental office. 
14697 I don t think they last that long. 
14698 Just one word...Excellent!!! 
14699 This tripod is awesome and we have used it on all kinds of terrain from rocks to dirt to inclines and it stays straight and level. Easy to adjust for filming at weird angles. Feels really strong. Heavy to carry. 
14700 Iove, love, love it, it is difficult taking photos of glass or shiney pewter. This camera makes it a breeze...replaced my Canon Sureshot! 
14701 Deserving of 5 stars 
14702 item arrived quickly and product quality exceeded my expectations 
14703 It works quite well. I am having an issue getting securely attached to my tripod so it doesn t move on the tripod head. 
14704 not as good as I expect. 
14705 Works great for my Sony RX100 III camera. Comfortable and easy to use. 
14706 finally a replacement charger that has the same features as my last!!! and that too it actually charges faster than my original i think! 
14707 All the stuff you need but the man f doesn t provide ... great package at a low price! 
14708 what an excellent tripod!!!! 
14709 This was a great product for the money and being similar to a go pro but for a fraction of the price. Highly recommend this for starters! 
14710 adequate 
14711 This power battery grip works great with my Nikon D5500, no problems at all, I can high recommend this grip if you looking for one. 
14712 Does not load photos 
14713 Satisfied 
14714 This was just okay for a quick fix. But I think I should have bought something different. 
14715 the best!! 
14716 Works as advertised. Great product and haven t had any issues. 
14717 Work well and are a good value 
14718 This works great for my small digital camera. I ve been able to take my camera with me on outings such as the Dirty Dash and haven t had to worry about damaging the camera. 
14719 Too much for something that is an adventure to install ! If you simply MUST have this brand screen protector, then buy TWO. One for the first failure and the second for, hopefully, the successful install ! 
14720 Easy to install and nicely built 
14721 defective out of the box. the part that attaches to the camera was not assembled properly and didn t align on the camera. had to return so don t know if anything else about it 
14722 flimsy design. 
14723 I was able to get the moisture spots off the sensor, but the dust and lint was a problem. I used the product as directed, but still saw dust on the sensor even after repeating the cleaning several times. 
14724 OMG this is loud! I have it wired into a SmartThings outlet. I made the mistake of testing it inside, and my son was so angry he threw his fork at me. And it seems well built as well - I think it will stand up to the elements. 
14725 My second Canon Powershot. Love this camera, so easy to run and all the accessories make it great. Good for novice for experienced photographers. 
14726 Batteries don t last. 2 years later, they won t hold their charge at all. SONY batteries purchased before that have continued to hold 100%. 
14727 Absolutely adore my camera! 
14728 Works great for my d3200 
14729 We have used this gopro more than I ever thought we would, we take it everywhere and the pictures are always awesome. I had never used one and I m not tech savvy at all and I had little issue figuring it out, it s worth the money!!!! 
14730 The battery does just what is designed for and has performed as expected. 
14731 Sorry to say mine didn t work properly. Only one side work. And there is a loud popping static sound on the other side. Maybe somebody else will have better luck but mine was a malfunction I guess. 
14732 Works great, but I could have just bought the 10X as this is the only one I ve ever used 
14733 Simply indispensable. No more lost or dropped caps 
14734 Excelent product 
14735 Awesome kit. I ve used everything already - even taken the chest & head mounts jet skiing/ wakeboarding :) Definitely suggest purchasing. 
14736 Extends and collapses much easier than the internally wired version. 
14737 I love the strap, but it was shipped with an off brand attachment, not the Black Rapid FastenR-3 
14738 Love these!! Very hard to set up, called tech support and they did it all for me. Was &#34;online &#34; in about an hour. Great buy. 
14739 👌🏽 
14740 Great Price 
14741 This is a nice lens pouch. For those people griping that the pouch did not fit their lens, try measuring your lens and pick the size that fits it. 
14742 Amazing product !!! 
14743 Great lens, great service. 
14744 Good deal. 
14745 Excellent!!!! 
14746 Exactly as advertised!!! Quick shipment+++ 
14747 Awesome 
14748 I use my case for the GoPro 3.0 (in waterproof case) and four batteries and I couldn t be happier. This case is small but holds and protects the essentials. There is room for random small items in the lid pocket too. 
14749 Very handy and stylish cold shoe adapter! Use this to mount my Sennheiser MKE600 mic to Zacuto Half Cage. Works flawlessly and once the plastic ratcheting knob replaced by metal knob seems to be the same build quality as Zacuto! 
14750 Nice products. 
14751 I m very disappointed with the GoPro4 Back. I purchased it and after 1 week, It started freezing and now I cannot use anymore!!! I lost information of my last two adventure running!!!! I really hate it!!!! It freezes every I press the Buttons Mode and Shuttle!!! 
14752 Great lens! 
14753 I use my camera every day for work and I ve tried a few different brands. None last as long as the original Canon battery, but these come closest. 
14754 I have found that when taking pictures with it, it works best on 1 to 2 subjects and only close up. So if that is what you need it for then I would suggest it. It is tricky when you have glasses. It leaves the circle light on them. 
14755 ok 
14756 Quick link to Vera3. Works well. Highly recommend this. 
14757 Using the filter now & it is exactly what I needed. They included a lens cloth & lovely note from the one who runs of the company. I like Tiffen products & will continue to buy them. 
14758 the camera is awesome, the jawbone im having trouble with. 
14759 Great price 
14760 Great kit for starters or intermediates. Great kit for the price. 
14761 Great deal. Very pleased with my purchase. 
14762 Very happy with the unit....excellent quality, fits all my needs and the price is right! 
14763 Great price and quality 
14764 Worked out very well for our purposes! 
14765 I use these diffusers on my yongnuo 568 flashes and they fit perfectly. I use them outdoors to diffuse the hard flash when I cannot bounce it. Great price as well. 
14766 It s great! It has absolutely met our needs of being a small tripod for flexible mounting. 
14767 Love this case. Customize the fit with the cubed foam and dividers. 
14768 Very good 
14769 Well worth the money. 
14770 Fantastic price! Love the customizable inside (with velcro partitions). It held a lot more than I expected. 
14771 it broke after I used it two times ): 
14772 I really need one of these, but I am not smart enough for this particular one. It is not simply plug and play, so to speak. I was in above my head. So, unfortunately, I had to return it. Best of luck to you if you decide to try it. 
14773 Bought this kit for my brother so that he would have an extra battery. He was very excited about the mini tripod and ability to charge the battery in his truck. This kit is a Super value and quality product. 
14774 The threads were too long for my application (Garmin Virb mounts). Also, the diameter of the threaded portion is too large for Garmin Virb mounts. 
14775 It worked and easy to replace the original. 
14776 The white trash and ghetto thugs living around me think they are real and that s good enough for me. Combine these with Mr Beams motion sensor lights and you ll be making those unsightly neighbors very uncomfortable and compliant in no time 
14777 Fine 
14778 It s cute and it helps with taking selifes on the fujififilm instax mini. the color also maches my camera. 
14779 The battery fit great! I m very happy with my purchase! And it hardly took any time to get here, great shipping! Thank you 
14780 I love this carrying case and I can put all my stuffs here in one 
14781 We were very happy with everything, especially the price. Delivery was as promised. Very pleased, would buy again. 
14782 Worked great for my canon 6D 
14783 I could not connect to the camera. LAN cable to the camera and the PoE power supply then to the router. The light on camera came on but kept getting Log In Failure using the supplied Configure Setup software. Returned the camera. 
14784 Camera sucks but flies great. No ability to attach different camera. 
14785 very good piece of little majic in Photo & VideoTechnology 
14786 Just ok ,four star 
14787 All was good - on time and batteries as expected. Price was good - Always need spare batteries when you travel. 
14788 Excellent product, very comfortable and very reliable seller 
14789 Return it 
14790 great 
14791 Really sturdy and good for basic camera beeds 
14792 It uses your phone s hotspot, and big pictures take a long time. Couldn t keep the connection long enough for it to work. 
14793 The batteries lasted a longer time than the ones that came with the camera. They came with a great travel charger. An incredible value for the cost! I received the package in a very timely manner as well. 
14794 Glad I purchased this. It really tightened up the focus on all my lenses. Simple to use. Just check your cameras first to see if they have a focus fine adjustment feature. Otherwise this will not help you. 
14795 This product works beautifully and made everyone at the birthday party happy. 
14796 Very flimsy and poorly constructed. After using it just one time, pieces of it were already chipping off. 
14797 A little thin but gorgeous and can t beat the price. Need thicker background underneath to avoid translucency. I just used an older backdrop and it worked perfectly. 
14798 I saw on Pinterest many people used this products at their weddings and then couples would write a memory below there picture. It s quick and simple to use and brings you back to the good old days. 
14799 Love these! 
14800 it was ok but battery didnt last long and cant have it more then 40 feet away 
14801 Great cloths 
14802 Great fit, no bubbles, so far very good. 
14803 Great love it 
14804 This is to replace a camera that was stolen from me. This is better than the one that was stolen. I could not be happier with this one. Thank you for a wonderful camera. 
14805 Worked perfectly in my FinePix F600EXR 
14806 small but nice when you need some extra light. 
14807 perfect for photo s thank you 
14808 Excellent product 
14809 Excellent! Thank you!! 
14810 took great picture love them 
14811 The strap was too big to hook up to my wife s camera, but I was able to adapt it. Works Great. 
14812 Keeps more charge than my actual Canon battery. 
14813 Happy with my purchase. 
14814 Work great! Other members in our group were envious and wanted one! 
14815 Excellent, it does the job! I have take it with me to 3 overseas trips already with no issues 
14816 We really like them. Fun for getting closer details on the moon. 
14817 its great 
14818 It helps to take selfis!!!yayyy!! 
14819 didn t work 
14820 One charging port does not work. 
14821 Good 
14822 I ve bought these before they work quite well look good 
14823 They don t last as long as the OEM batteries, but with 2 of these in a battery grip, you ll make it through an entire day of shooting with power to spare. Considering the price, I d buy more of these before spending the $ for the OEM battery. 
14824 Arrived on time and the quality is pretty good! Highly recommend this product! 
14825 Excellent !!! 
14826 good product, good price 
14827 Great Product!! 
14828 Works okay for the money! 
14829 Looks great on! Can t wait to use it. 
14830 Always need an extra camera battery - this charged quickly and is doing its job! 
14831 I just got this today and it is already packaged to be returned. Apart from being junk, the battery was corroded and the film was dated 2002. What???? Save some money and buy a disposable camera, they will work much better. If I could give it zero stars I would. 
14832 The lens cap fits fine on my Nikon Coolpix P90 NIKOR 24X 4.4-110.4mm lens. It gets my 4 star solely because it fits OK, hasn t broken, and was cheap. 
14833 Two for just a couple $$$ more than the single. Gotta love Amazon. 
14834 They were the worse thing I ever bought 
14835 Cheap 
14836 Iv e been using this on the hot shoe of my d3300 and this flash does great in TTL mode. When autofocus is enabled (and the flash is on the hot shoe) there is a ring laser that shoots forward, can help with low-light autofocus. 
14837 I love this camera you have to be pashint that s all 
14838 Value and quality!! Great camera for begginers and Pro 👍📷 
14839 Pretty much a good value. Fairly complete package, although I am sure that eventually I will be upgrading some of the accessories. 
14840 nice product , but it should come with power supply or choice of when buying from this company 
14841 Comparatively speaking, this is a great deal on the instax mini film. Best price I have found! Shipped in 2 days with prime. Thus will be my go to film purchase when I need refills for my Fujifilm Hello Kitty Instax Mini! 
14842 this is my first prime lens and i really love it, it takes great images and i just love it! if mine broke i would buy it again 
14843 ND is divided right in the middle with no adjustment. Causes framing shots nearly in half. 
14844 Great second battery! 
14845 This is a great system for the price we love it it works perfectly. 
14846 A decent lens for beginners-awesome with lots of light 
14847 too soft 
14848 Product as advertised, shipped promptly and at a reasonable price. 
14849 nice 
14850 works for what i eeded for a sall price 
14851 Superior quality Easy install A great deal for the money 
14852 VERY CHEAP MATERIAL ... BATTERIES RUN LOW FAST. NOT WORTH IT. .. LOOKS FAKE ANYWAYS 
14853 Thank you for your service, I love the product 
14854 Always a good idea to insure your items when you have a thriving business 
14855 Good! 
14856 as advertised, arrived before expected... nice surprise, THANKS, J 
14857 The stand start to get loose in the head after some use. It is not a durable or heavy duty stand. 
14858 Couldn t find this cable anywhere. Came quick and works perfectly. Can t beat the price. Great Product. 
14859 No Prop lines in the video, love it! 
14860 Won t stay on! Keeps falling off! Crappy product! 
14861 Awesome camera...... Does everything a gopro does for $350 LESS. 
14862 sale as advertised. 
14863 Well executed harness. This is my second one.The straps will eventually stretch out but that won t happen for years. 
14864 Its hard fort me to give 5 but it works and is what I needed thanks for the good service 
14865 It was broken when I received it .so I didn t get a chance to use it 
14866 Very cheaply made. 
14867 Very realistic. Just what I wanted for now. 
14868 Very poor quality. 
14869 Great products!!!! Very durable. 
14870 Has all the bells and whistles you need. The only drawback is that the shutter is loud. 
14871 I was expecting something of low quality for the price. I rarely leave reviews but I m so happy with this things that I need to tell others 
14872 Exactly as expected, protects hotshoe, centers with level. 
14873 Easy to take pictures or video. Great quality. Good battery life. Highly recommend it. 
14874 It works great!! 
14875 Perfect, nice and cheap. Arrived faster than expected. 
14876 This is not a regular mirror things farther than about 15 feet are tiny. I just want to know when someone is behind me so this works for me. Also, remove plastic cover from mirror 
14877 Arrived promptly. Exactly as described. 
14878 Met all expectations 
14879 Excellent! I loved and it worked very well. 
14880 Great tool kit 
14881 works perfect with my hero 4 silver. such a great buy as the batteries do run low quickly and having a few backups in my bag makes life perfect 
14882 Great product. Images are high quality. Can t complain. 
14883 Works good. 
14884 Excellent camera. Great price! 
14885 Battery doesn t stay charged 
14886 WORKS WELL, Satified with the quality for the price. 
14887 Physically a little longer than the 35 f2.8 and therefore easier to hold. Becoming one of my favorite lenses. 
14888 Nice case. Room for extra battery, card 
14889 Useless commodity. Neither battery was chargeable. It s not worth processing for a refund. 
14890 Absolutely great. Actually better than I imagined. I am very pleased with the quality of this camera. Pictures and video turn out great. I also had quick follow up with the seller just making sure everything was as expected. 
14891 The soil is used contaminated a whole bunch of stuff, send me them! I got really upset. 
14892 security system is excellent ,, and I can monitor my des iPhone or tablet, I recommend :) 
14893 Great starter camera 
14894 These Batteries worked Perfect for my Canon Vixia S20. The charger also in good. The cost vs. Canon s price is like 1/3 the price. 
14895 Would have been better if it didn t come broken! 
14896 good inexpensive attachment for my Canon telephoto lens to provide protection. 
14897 The size of the shield is smaller than the size of the LCD screen 
14898 Excellent product! Bought two separate frames twice. Very happy with the purchases.. 
14899 Not for heavy cameras. Based on another review I thought it would be sturdy but it is not and you can tell as soon as you feel the box. The monopod part also did not extend as much as I thought it would. Probably okay for casual light use. 
14900 Super pretty summery film. Fast delivery great price 
14901 Great product! 
14902 Works well. And for that price no one can complain. 
14903 It has a bit of a rubbery smell but it works quite well! 
14904 easy to set up and use 
14905 Very good value for the price. 
14906 Just what was requested. Thank you. 
14907 Charges good, keeps full charge for long time 
14908 ok 
14909 No issues, works great as per advertised. 
14910 couldn t have better. it is great 
14911 No grippy Handel just hard plastic feels cheap but gets job done. 
14912 Item arrived as promised. 
14913 Comfy and stylish 
14914 Love it 
14915 Gift, reasonable, child is happy. 
14916 One of those you get what you pay for. It carries a good amount, durability is the issue. Mine s already ripping at the top handle after 2 mild uses. 
14917 Ver y good 
14918 needs second pocket. inside pocket of the one opening is too shallow. Discs fall out. Had to buy another to hold my camera. Fortunately the camera was better than the case! Don t buy it unless you are need to have only one thing in it. 
14919 Yep, !!! 
14920 It s perfect working. 
14921 Great Item. Well made. Good stitching. Easy to fill. Nothing to complain again. Used this item to weight down our film lighting stands and they worked a treat. 
14922 Charged my old battery for my point and shoot! 
14923 Very professional sturdy build. 
14924 The camera was not what I thought it would be so the this protection plan was a waste of my money since I do not even use this camera. 
14925 Takes videos much better than photos. iPhone beats photo quality for sure 
14926 As advertised 
14927 Works as advertised and expected of a Nikon product. 
14928 Very good quality 
14929 I ve only had a couple flights so far, but I m impressed. Very easy to fly and video and camera shot are awesome. It will only get better the more I fly it 
14930 Nice light weight. 
14931 Works great, great color, easy to use. Highly recommend this product. Be sure to buy the floating straps, too. 
14932 I just got the camara today. I love it. It is easy to use. I definitely recommend this camera. 
14933 Used this product during our honeymoon. Worked very well and I received the same amount of time on this battery as I did the stock battery. It s very nice to have the 2 extra batteries plus the convenience of mobile charging. 
14934 Had to return the main product these accessories, and this seller did not take these back. 
14935 Just perfect! 
14936 I am so happy with these lights so far. Amazing battery life and a good light output. I definitely wouldn t mind having a few more filters/gels, but for the price I am so happy with the lights. 
14937 Wonderful!! Great price!! 
14938 No better than the 700TVL cameras that I had before and they were pretty bad especially for night vision 
14939 Keeps my go pro safe, and it isn t boring. 
14940 Fit my Nikon D200 perfectly. Took a good charge. Does what it says it will do. 
14941 very effective, works for me. 
14942 good and light 
14943 I like these opera glasses. They fulfilled their promised, but I do wish I could have gotten a higher magnification. 
14944 Videos come in hkv format. Have to watch full video can t skip thru. 
14945 Didn t come with directions, pretty easy to figure out though. Got the job done. 
14946 Perfect for taking anywhere where there is an electrical outlet to recharge battery, and spare battery. Never have to worry about no charge in battery, so always have picture taking ability. 
14947 I afraid that I bought it so much big to my lens..I mean I didn t read in the product details about the filter size&#62; I use a Nikon and those filter don t fit an any lens that I have....Bad purchase. 
14948 Works as advertised. 
14949 It worked better then expected 
14950 This light is massive produces minimal heat for a CFL. and great to add light to my aloe plants :) 
14951 Instructions are horrible 
14952 Super cute! Can t wait to do our 6 month pictures with our little man! 
14953 This lighting set is working PERFECT for my video blogs. Great product at a great price! 
14954 Ok, but a bit stiff and hard to close. 
14955 Doesn t work and got no refund. Stay away 
14956 Very good product 
14957 love it soooo much. 
14958 Works perfect love the additional accessories like the tripod and cleaning material and car charger 
14959 Not impressed with lens adapter for the add on lenses. No need for the add on flash 
14960 Camera fogged in side camera lens during first use. 
14961 amazing quality...love it perfectly fits my nikon d3200 
14962 Great product for the price. It also came with a portable bag to carry it around. Its very convenient and lightweight. Great for any kind of angles. 
14963 Very nice pole... Only thing I recommend is drying it out when doe using on water sports! But besides that great product would recommend 
14964 Item was shipped fast but the zoom lens is loose and when holding camera down the lens will slide out and it shouldn t move. Not the seller s fault but a factory problem. Takes good pictures but mechanical flawed. 
14965 I bought this with the expectation that I am able to pan my camera for panoramic pictures. The problem is when the ball is locked into place, it also locks the panning mechanism below! You can t rotate the damn thing. Stupid design. 
14966 good product and so good seller help me and contact me so fast thank yoooooou 
14967 We wanted the loud ringer, and the paging feature was a helpful addition. The 3 watt amp is pretty strong, too. All of the Viking components are easy to configure and wire 
14968 Right out of the box, the owner s manual is missing. I m thinking this is a return. I will charge the battery, go online to look for a manual, but if the camera doesn t work, I want a full refund. I m very upset. 
14969 You get what you pay for here. Works, but not 100%. 
14970 Perfect! 
14971 Great! 
14972 Not great quality. When shifted, the filter darkness does not cover the entire lens so during long exposures, the lighting is exposed differently across the picture. I suggest buying something more expensive for better quality. 
14973 good product 
14974 exelent 
14975 As advertised. Serves the purpose well. 
14976 I m really impressed with the camera itself the range of motion is great, and the picture quality is amazing for such and inexpensive camera. Where the product fails is the app it crashes constantly it seems to have a really hard time staying connected to the unit. 
14977 good deal! 
14978 For an amateur, this works great. Easy to set up and fast. 
14979 They work wonderfly when you re using them but trying to fold them up and put them back into the protective sleave is a pain. Otherwise it s a nice product to have. 
14980 No, it does not meet my expectations. I need to return. 
14981 I have not had the time to try all of the capabilities of the Nikon D3200 digital camera, but so far have found it easy to use and adaptable, resulting in excellent pictures. 
14982 Those li-42B are great. 
14983 This is a tripod. It s a pretty decent inexpensive tripod, and if that s what you need, I say order it. But if you need a light stand ... this won t do. 
14984 The case is nice but it is a bit hard to get the micro cards to stay in the foam. However, it got me to Africa and back and kept the cards clean and dry. 
14985 Very light and portable,folds up to a nice carrying size.Also sturdy enough to use outside.highly recommended 
14986 Meets all expectations 
14987 Good 
14988 Bought this last minute for a cruise. Takes pretty good pictures, zoom feature is excellent, but the time needed between pics is inconvenient. However, as a basic camera it does the job. 
14989 attractive case and fits great in my center console 
14990 The cameras are good and with the POE (power over ethernet) it makes running the wire much more simple. The downfall is the controller and HDD, it constantly needs reformat and will not overwrite the current recordings. 
14991 Great image quality. Tricky to get set up but customer service has been very helpful with getting things set correctly. 
14992 Showed up only one side charges. 
14993 Good for Linear systems. This remote will NOT work with Genie Garage door openers. 
14994 Excellent product. Stable, smooth and easy to use! 
14995 On time and as described. Very pleased with seller and item. 
14996 An actual Panasonic battery wow 
14997 Not the best 
14998 This Item was the same item that I had for my camera, no difference from the charger that come with the camera. The delivery was fast with no problems at all. I would recommend this company. 
14999 One of the two soft buttons (the black) has some &#34;other&#34; additional mark on the surface....which I don t like....the quality is much better in the photograph... 
15000 Did not have a universal fit like it describes. My Cool pics and Easyshare didn t fit. I returned for my money. 
15001 CHARGES FROM MY 20 WATT SOAR PANEL KEEPS BATTERY S FULL WHEN I M OUT ALL DAY SHOOTING PICS 
15002 Good price. They just go way to quickly especially when using the wifi. I have 6 batteries in constant rotation to have any fun making vids. Dual charger is a must have as well... 
15003 Love this camera you can zoom in and say stuff through mic 
15004 Smudge on the lens that I couldn t get off. Took a few pictures...all blurred. 
15005 This adapter works well. A bit on the expensive side, but I can now use my existing 58 mm filters. Easy peasy to install. 
15006 These work great in the Polaroid printer camera, just know they do not have sticky backs so you ll need tape. 
15007 It was just what I needed, and shipping time was great, got it before our trip. Price included a battery, so I can charge one and have it ready and waiting, no need to wait the the other one to charge. 
15008 Beautiful pictures, easy to set up, am going to give one to my daughter for Christmas this year! 
15009 Henry was very quick in fixing my problem accessing my camera through my android. Thank you very much for taking the time to correct this. 
15010 Adorable , came earlier than package had said &#60;3 
15011 Works as advertised. Pretty light weight. Pretty rugged. I used it backpacking and thought it was worth the weight. Just something fun to have to look at peaks and stars. Don t expect to discover any new planets with it. 
15012 Great service and product 
15013 Great price, good product. 
15014 The Smallrig is perfect cold shoe mount for field applications of mics 
15015 good combo 
15016 A perfect alternative to the expensive Fuji battery and charger. The charger works fine and I have noticed no difference in battery life in the camera. Very pleased with this purchase. 
15017 The swith was handy and decent at switching devices to a default. Now my TV with one HDMI port can have three HDMI devices attached. 
15018 This mount works perfectly for its intended purpose. It saved me buying another camera. It made it possible to view 2 sides of my house. I was able to utilize the full pan & tilt feature of outdoor camera. 
15019 Batteries are good, charger works fine and I received immediate phone support regarding a question. 
15020 My laptop charger took crap. This replacement worked perfect. Quick shipping and good price. 
15021 I finally got to play around with this. It is an amazing microscope for simple everyday hobbyists. I thought I would encounter a problem when I upgraded to Windows 10 but the drivers work fine. The drivers are downloadable from the Plugable technologies website. 
15022 For the price, you d think you would get more fly time. Oh technology limitations. It s a battery. It works. 
15023 Nice additIon to my go pro system....now no more charging in the camera! 
15024 Works great. Good image quality! 
15025 was happy to be able to get one for a very old flash unit. 
15026 The battery arrived in good condition and promptly. Once fully charged it worked as expected. No issues. 
15027 Fabulous lens. Works very well in all focal lengths and apertures so far after 600 shots. This will be my favorite matched combo with the Rebel 1 - T5. Until I check out the T6-x. 
15028 Flimsy and overly complicated design (the amount of pieces that extend. There is really no suitable purpose for these. I wish i could return them. 
15029 Works wonderfully and fits all my GoPro accessories. 
15030 works great - keeps the camera from sinking 
15031 ♫ ♪ ♫ A Pleasure ♫ ♪ ♫ tucksmusicstore.com 
15032 I like this one better than the Neewer Camera Tripod Mounting PLate with Quick Release that was all black. This one fits tighter. 
15033 As soon as I got my ROXANT PRO video camera stabilizer, I tried it with a smaller camera (Sony RX100 = 240 g) and it worked great. Your product is unbelievably sturdy and well designed for a really great price. Please keep me posted on future technical breakthroughs. 
15034 The 2 way audio works...the setup was not very easy. IPCam Viewer App does not have this model IP Camera for the smart phone. 
15035 Not only is this a great product, their customer service is top notch. I have already recommended this to other people. If you have any issues getting this connected reach out to them and they will certainly help out. Don t look any further. Buy it! 
15036 Very pleased with item. It arrived quickly and is perfect for the camera.. 
15037 fine 
15038 clunky interface 
15039 Great case. No real downfalls. Be up and flying in minutes. iPad slots could be a tad wider because I keep them in cases to protect screen and they are snug 
15040 Received and it was broken 
15041 It works but the red tip is hard to put on and I wish it was smaller. I know there is a smaller one but the smaller one did not get good reviews. 
15042 Great product and perfect transaction. 
15043 We love the camera strap! 
15044 I m satisfied. Great seller.. Thank you 
15045 Does not fit my factory Gopro case or the aftermarket case i purchased. totally useless junk. 
15046 Good price, fast shipping, durable product. 
15047 Must have for GoPro Hero owners. GoPro should have included it with the Hero. 
15048 Works like a charm 
15049 The item is as described by the seller -- be sure to attach the adaptor before the lens covers - I had to play with it a little to get it to work, but these are definitely for the Canon PowerShot SX50. All in alln a good deal. 
15050 Great camera the only thing I didnt like was going from water to surface and the amount of time it took to get the lens clear so the picture wasn t blurry 
15051 It s not good :( I m not happy i open it it s toooooo small not great quality recording and pictures are worse i don t know how to get a refund but I wish I could :( 
15052 Best camera I have ever used! 
15053 Does the job but it shakes a lot and can get uncomfortable against your ear. Hence the 3 star 
15054 they were better than I actually expected them to be 
15055 Really nice, sharp lens. Great price for a good piece! 
15056 as expected 
15057 It does what is expected. 
15058 Gift 
15059 Nice little polarizer, makes a big difference when shooting water or sky. 
15060 Awesome camera 
15061 Kind of plastic-y. Not impressed. 
15062 I really liked using the Bobber on my go pro while snorkeling. One funny thing I did notice is that when out of the water bees and other insects were certainly attracted to the yellow color of the bobber. 
15063 works wonderfully i would recommend this version of the GoPro over the fancy versions with the LCD viewer and WiFi just as rugged without the added cost 
15064 We were looking for a good bridge camera to go with our long lens DSLRs. This camera is great...perfect for landscapes. Images are crisp and beautiful, it s easy to use, and compact. A great buy!!! A must for vacation. 
15065 its light, easy to setup, easy to store, and holds a background up. 
15066 Really comfortable and useful strap. 
15067 I wouldn t recommend. It definitely doesn t work for what I want. EXTREMELY limited focus. You truly get what you pay for. The only upside, packaging was great and it did arrive quickly. 
15068 Great tool, does exactly what it is supposed to do, amazing build quality. I tied mine onto the pull of my GoPro case, so I always know where it is. Adventure on.... 
15069 Happy with product. Just as described. 
15070 Bobber is doing good job. You don t have to put water inside like some people advice - is perfect balanced. 
15071 Nice job, Amazon! Plenty of compartments and padding for all of my accessories. 
15072 Thx 
15073 Product as expect! Fast shipping! 
15074 best binoculars I have ever owned 
15075 This is all you need for your Go Pro Spare battery and charging kit. 
15076 Wow its amazing and my daughter is happy happy 
15077 Great quality and compact product. 
15078 I thought I was getting a good deal for B+W 72mm UV filter but when it arrived, it was a used one. It had finger prints and a dry sugary substance (ad if someone spilled soda on it) very disappointed. Going to stick with purchasing my filters from B&H Photo 
15079 Everything was awesome!! Delivery was amazing!! Wouldn t have bought it any other way and I totally recommend others to get their GoPro this way as well!! Thank you! 
15080 Excellent, thank you... 
15081 Great microscope, I use it to photo coins for sale and it takes great closeups. 
15082 Great value. They are better than original. 
15083 Arrived early and works great on my Sony A77ii, what more could I want. Very happy. 
15084 A+ 
15085 Nice hood, well constructed and good fit. 
15086 Superb lens. I ve been using this on my Nikon for over a year in all types of situations (indoor, outdoor, fast action, macro, etc.) 
15087 Never have been able to get it to work. What s the secret? 
15088 👌🏻 
15089 Great telescope, easy to assemble and set up, great views of the moon. Haven t tried planets yet. My first real scope. Tremendous service from Orion for suggested accessories. 
15090 Love it! It s everything I expected! 
15091 Excellent 
15092 No matter the settings, I cannot seem to get a clear picture when inside. I bought this so I didn t need my large camera on me all the time. Disappointed. 
15093 Got it as a replacement. it works nicely. 
15094 Good connectivity and price. 
15095 works good 
15096 This case is better then I expected!! Very cool!! I added the DJI logo, looks even better!! 
15097 Too small to fit compact camera Cannon Power Shot SX710HS (it is a really small case) 
15098 This battery fit my camera perfectly and charged beautifully in the battery charger that I also bought, 
15099 The plastic sheet protectors seemed loose before use. Decided to return. 
15100 Absolutely love this camera. It has a lot of cool features!!! 
15101 Good recorder for the price 
15102 2nd Nikon binocular I bought. These were less money than first and we are just as satisfied. 
15103 ok 
15104 Quick shipping, quick connexion to bluetooth & compatible with Iphone 5! 
15105 Just what we need for our trip. 
15106 Outstanding camera! Easy setup! Love it! Will buy a couple more! 
15107 i used it with my phone and it s works ok 
15108 When turn on camera need to pull battery out and back in for camera to work 
15109 It does the Job just right good price vale 
15110 Nothing works like to original. Great battery pack. No short charge issues like those found on some clones. 
15111 Works perfect i could not complain at all 
15112 It does the macro job! focusing is quite challenging though. 
15113 It s perfect! 
15114 It stopped the jellow on my phantom 2. So I m satisfied 
15115 My husband and I were looking to buy a GoPro when we came across this bundle and we are happy we did. Being able to get a lot of accessories for a few dollars more was great. We cannot wait to create memories with this amazing bundle. 
15116 Great product. 
15117 Works great! 
15118 Great product, fits perfectly in my lens 
15119 Nice design and excellent construction. Works great with my Zoom H5 portable recorder too. 
15120 So far all of the accessories work as expected EXCEPT for the selfie stick. It s horrible quality and will not hold your GoPro without rotating around. Trash the selfie stick and buy a better one if you really need one (I didn t). 
15121 Pretty good buy. Gets the job done for the most part. 
15122 I like it! 
15123 Love my camera backpack took it to Costa Rica and was perfect for traveling!! 
15124 This tripod is not up to my expectations too short and unstable but for the money I guess it s all right 
15125 Great photos and video, arrived in two days. Would highly recommend this product and would highly recommend amazon. 
15126 It s okay, some pictures came out great. Others looked like webcam quality. Sucks up batteries though. Bring lots of batteries. 
15127 its ok 
15128 It was free and I still wouldn t use it. I hope no one actually pays for this. 
15129 Great packaging and product was what I expected. Great value. 
15130 Great for my project 
15131 too expensive... 
15132 I wanted to return this because the sound quality is so poor that there is constant background noise even in complete silent rooms. Other then that it s great but with sound so terrible I felt as if the device was broken. 
15133 Came on time, battery however does not sit in it correctly but seems to be charging. 
15134 Excellent upgrade!!! 
15135 Excellent.. very well made with all the storage and pockets needed.. 
15136 Tina Gonzalez was excellent in helping me set up my cameras - she was awesome!!!!!! 
15137 Excellent method to attach a Loupe to the 5DSR. Very well made and do like the lift up and swing away capability to move the Loupe without removing it from the camera. 
15138 I had to get a second strap in order to be able to have a strap around my neck while using the camera. So far that means there are 2 straps on the camera and I haven t figured out a better way. Otherwise, I am happy with it. 
15139 Works as promised. 
15140 The lens performed superbly, with very sharp pictures. In good light, the f/4 aperture provided excellent performance for short exposures with action sharply stopped. A wonderful purchase! 
15141 i like the camera...still in the process of learning about the camera but I do like that both video and photos can be taken I also like the large megapixels as well as it being able to hold a larger SD card. 
15142 It s bad quality and can t see for my cellphone or internet... 
15143 Its a little on the cheap side but it has some nice compartments which seem a little flimsy though. Not bad for the price. 
15144 perfect. 
15145 Good 
15146 Great lightweight tripod! 
15147 Okay quality, batteries last about 50-75% as long as OEM. 
15148 The batteries were not the 1450 mAh brand pictured, but 1200 mAh Bower batteries. Both are good batteries, and both last longer than the Canon OEM 1000 mAh battery that came with the PowerShot S95. 
15149 thank you 
15150 I got electric shocks each time I touch 
15151 Works great. No problems at all. Jim 
15152 great back pack for my camera and camera stuff 
15153 Awesome !!! 
15154 It arrived earlier than predicted and works great. I have no complaints about it. 
15155 This camera is breath of fresh air. Amazing zoom, easy to use because its just like my Samsung Galaxy 4. Wifi so you can instantly email or post on facebook, shutterfly etc. 
15156 Great 
15157 Henry at tech support was great in setting up the camera. Awesome customer service. 
15158 Like that it s manual focus with built in hood. Seems sharp for the price. I just don t like the limited aperture stops. 
15159 My first Big lens! very Very Happy!! 
15160 Worked perfect with my camera. 
15161 The cords for the lights are very short. The lights are top heavy and one fell over and broke the bulb on the 2nd use :-(. 
15162 Scanner was fine. I thought in reading the description it was an upgraded version. I already had one like the one I ordered. 
15163 It fits my hybrid bike bar, and it holds OK. However, it doesnt t fir my road bike bar. 
15164 Makes a big difference in my images. Easy to use. 
15165 For the money this reflects really does the job! I use it all the time in my photography classes! Gold and Silver is a great combination! 
15166 excelente 
15167 Arrived on time. Have used a couple of times and quality of material and function are very good. 
15168 Beautiful idea, design and quality manufacturing. Works as expected and makes holding the camera with one hand a pleasure. 
15169 This is an awesome product. It holds on windows and non porous surfaces. 
15170 Love it! 
15171 Love this! Very comfortable. 
15172 I was looking for a very tall mono-pod. I found it to be a little shaky when extended to full length. Still, works good and I will continue to use it. 
15173 Lost my genuine Nikon TTL cord at an event, and sorely missed it. Doubtful, I gave this a whirl, and it s perfect! Arrived next day! 
15174 great 
15175 Terrible product. Worked only 3 times and never again. Do not waste your money in this crap 
15176 Purchased two speedlights with a YN560-TX. The results are superb. It took me a while to get them set up correctly to start taking pictures off camera, since i m new to flash photography. This a must buy. Will update later after i ve done more testing 
15177 Another product that is WAY overpriced, but exactly what us video guys need. It s aluminum foil people. 
15178 Worked as expected 
15179 Excellent set of binoculars. They are better than expected! 
15180 Perfect match for the SIRUI P-326 6 section monopod. Easy to set up and adjust the friction resistance to suit ones needs. 
15181 Great quality for the price. No qualms about recommending this product. 
15182 I did very good pictures, i love it. 
15183 Really enjoy this easy to use camera! 
15184 Very fast shipping. New Product as described. Works very well. 
15185 Fits the copter, controller and charger great. No room for blades, tablet or other equipment. 
15186 Great buy 
15187 We have used our camera a handful of times and have even satisfied with the quality. I have yet to buy lithium batteries but I will be doing so. The regular AAA batteries are completely dead after only a half hour. 
15188 Definitely met my expectations! 
15189 Excellent product. 
15190 This camera is awesome - lots of features, is nice and compact making it easy to carry. 
15191 I got the accessories yesterday, when I open it, there is no connection with the selfie stick, I cannot use it for connecting with waterproof case. 
15192 great cams! WARNING.. If you use &#34;blue iris&#34; for your security system do not update the firmware on these. the last firmware (as of 8/20/2015) will not break the streaming to the software. However the cameras still work with other software. Also Infrared Leds could use better range...... 
15193 Doesn t even deserved 1 star.... Terrible, horrible, stupid app that will never connect to WIFI even when completing all steps multiple times your camera will appear offline on the app while the connection light is green. Without the app working this camera is useless... Never again.... 
15194 Love everything about this camcorder. The quality, the zoom, the auto focus, the stability feature.. its just amazing. only slight problem is that the battery pack sticks out. 
15195 Nicely made, looks good, supple and easy to use. 
15196 Works well, lightweight, compact, storage case. The top bar bends a little, but that s to be expected from an adjustable bar. 
15197 nice product 
15198 Great tiny camera. Great value for money 
15199 the caps don t stay on well, come off easily when bumped. the lens hood was alright, kind of a pain to line up nice though to shade. 
15200 the best 
15201 It works great and no one see s it lol 
15202 Came in excellent quality. 
15203 wonderful product 
15204 Great lighter weight 35mm camera. Excellent photo quality with the function to email a photo to anyone with a computer or phone. Photo correction program although limited has a good editing program. Great lense selection of which I have five. 
15205 These batteries work just as the GoPro one does! Charges well and leaves the battery fully charged 
15206 The description states that this contains a lithium metal battery. It actually contains a sealed lead acid battery. 
15207 good grip 
15208 As I expected 
15209 small, functional, works great, price is right. I did not do any research before buying it, but really happy with this mic. 
15210 Great product... 
15211 I had to call it in to get help and set it up with my mobile hot spot. The rep that helped me, Terry Morgan, was extremely helpful and walked me through the entire process. I m very happy with the product. 
15212 Perfect for glasses 
15213 Loved this lens and the bundle was great! Shipping was crazy fast too. I would definitely order from them again. 
15214 A good product. 
15215 Great light, works as advertised. However the battery backing pops out easily if you re not careful. Not the worst problem to have all things considered though. Great for getting a little extra fill light on indie film sets where time and resources are limited. 
15216 Worked very well and there are no problems with using them with the J5. Amazing price for three batteries. 
15217 Get teased for using a selfie stick! But seriously, this thing is solidly constructed and is great to get overhead shots in a crowd, and also really low shots (think skateboard videos that track along a few inches from the ground). 
15218 Works great 
15219 Just got, Have used it a little already taken a lot more pictures than my old one would have and still has 2 dots left. Thanks and the price was good also. 
15220 This is a very comfortable, great looking camera strap. It fits my camera perfectly. Very well made. 
15221 great for my needs when needed works well and very pleased. Thanks!! 
15222 I love the bluetooth shutter remote. Everything else is in great shape and works just fine. 
15223 Low quality 
15224 I love this sling, bought it prior to a trip to Disney World and this made it much easier to use my camera. 
15225 It works! Cap is good to protect camera lens while transporting and storing. Lens hood didn’t eliminate propeller shadow but definitely reduced it. Lightweight so does not effect gimbal balance. Overall, I’m happy with my purchase. 
15226 Great Quality - we recommend this item! 
15227 three thumbs up. 
15228 Works as intended! 
15229 excellent product. 
15230 Very good. The angle for the camera needs to be better though. Have to wear them funky to get the camera straight in front of you. Make sure to get vlc media player or the correct codecs or whatnot for the avi file. 
15231 Perfect replacement for the mount that went bad. 
15232 Perfect 
15233 VERY LARGE The camera is incredibly conspicuous, although pretty to look at – if it doesn t need to be subtle are hidden in anyway it should work well – my bad for ordering without considering that issue. Two large to hide amongst bric-a-brac at Cetera as I had hoped 
15234 camera does not seem to be working as it should according to the instructions,kindly have someone from amazon give me a call and walk me through setting up camera and getting it to work properly. 
15235 Came fast works as advertised. 
15236 Lttle stabilizer than can make a large difference. 
15237 We love the camera and the accessories as well :-) 
15238 Really nice reflector/diffuser! Very easy to use and does a great job. The design is great and very easy to hold and use with one hand. 
15239 Works perfectly and shipped faster than expected 
15240 perfect piece of equipment. 
15241 Super high quality. Pitched my wobbly old clamp lights straight into the recycling bin. 
15242 very nice product 
15243 Excellent purchase. Worked like a charm! Glad I bought it. 
15244 The product came with the brand name &#34;Camson&#34; written in front, it was not in the sample photos, I do not like how it looks. 
15245 A perfect fit and very fast service. 
15246 So far so good. I love that the lens can be tethered to e lens/camera so I don t have to hold onto it separately. 
15247 Excellent 
15248 Great price for a beginner photographer. 
15249 great 
15250 Inexpensive, works perfect. 
15251 This is a really affordable package when you break a light and need some replacements. I bought these as soon as one broke. Much better to buy in a package than to buy them singular. 
15252 Everything worked as expected. I would purchase again. 
15253 Case leaked while in Florida. 
15254 Bueno 
15255 The clip is good. Some angles are funky. It doesnt bend the whole 180 degrees so you cant get all the angles. Slips off of hard serfaces. Best use is on a backpack strap 
15256 Nice head strap, somehow stays cooler than its cheaper imitators. Get it so you can be a miner with a camera on your head. you know you always wanted to play miner..lol 
15257 Went all over Europe in my pocket. Over 6000 great pix. 
15258 Disappointed in the quality. Thought it would be leather. No plastic protectors , had to purchase them my self. WAY overpriced!!!!!!!!!!! 
15259 Works great and as described. Interesting that I didn t receive a wall charger for it though. Only a car charger? That s the only reason for a 4 star. No wall charger. 
15260 A great battery for my Tough 4 camera which I love! 
15261 Very happy 
15262 I was pleasantly surprised. The bag is bigger than I thought and therefore holds more equipment. It arrived rather quickly and more than met my expectations. It is a nice bag and well worth the money. T hank you. 
15263 Love this little bag but it was too small for my sons camera and lenses, so I had to return it. It is very well made, has little compartments and I recommend it highly for smaller cameras. 
15264 Useless. Unable to pan or tilt smoothly.. 
15265 Couldn t be happier!!! This thing is solid, and awesome! 
15266 Super fast shipping! I lost my original lens cap to a lake and this baby did the trick! The cleaning pen is awesome as is everything else in the package. For the price and quality, don t hesitate to click and buy NOW! 
15267 Do not waste your money-broke almost immediately on landing after third day flying. I would say I am a medium level drone operator and this product was poor. I own 5 drones, so take it from me, not worth the savings. 
15268 Works perfect, And fast shipping! 
15269 Case is as advertised. Wouldn t hesitate to buy from them again 
15270 They re a bit fragile but they can do the work, I use them to hold my reflectors and bounce cards. I like the tips because you can flip them over to adjust the grip. 
15271 Very comfortable. Item as described. 
15272 I bought this package for my daughter and she LOVES it. Great color case - my grandmother s favorite color - always loved it. Great gift idea to go with the scamera in the same color. 
15273 Incredible lens! 
15274 Fits my T3i camera body, 2 lens, and my speedlite. 
15275 I love working with ND filters and these give me a bit more to work with. They seem like good quality for the price, they may not be for professionals, but for me, I am very happy with them. 
15276 They work as advertised and working good and great products 
15277 Grest product 
15278 Hot Shoe Cover hits perfectly for my Sony a6000. 
15279 Installs pretty easily and has great picture. It s pretty cool to be able to check on my house when I m away. 
15280 Just as I expected. 
15281 Great product looks like it can hold and stand the test of time. 
15282 Very convenient and having no extra cords is a plus! 
15283 Absolutely am thrilled with such a good secondary battery for my T5. It holds a charge like a champ and hasn t caused me any issues on my all day shoots. Definitely recommend this battery if you want a good substitute or replacement battery for your Canon Rebel. 
15284 The best I have ever used! 
15285 keeps my need safe and secure, nice product for many needs. Thanks!! 
15286 Just right for my camera and &#34;stuff&#34; and at a great price. 
15287 works great. 
15288 Works fine but more instructions needed, like how to clear info. On chip. Does send out a lot of false alarms. Still trying to figure out why. 
15289 Works well. the cover/protectors are a nice value-add 
15290 Wow, this makes your GoPro look like a real camera. Its a little heavy. Really protects you camera. I got 37mm filter kit for it, works like a charm. 
15291 Like it it works great 
15292 Everything arrived ok! Great product. 
15293 Rad 
15294 Cheap, compact, takes decent video. Not giving 5 stars, because the battery capacity is terrible, and the battery fits entirely inside the cam, meaning larger aftermarket batteries are not possible. 
15295 Great product, as usual from SmallRig. Just what I wanted, and exactly as advertised. I have built many custom rigs, and SmallRig is rapidly becoming my favorite source. My clients are always impressed with the quality. 
15296 Poorly written instructions and doesn t work as advertised. 
15297 These filters are fantastic! Makes my pictures look as if I knew what I was doing. 
15298 I was looking for a battery for my Samsung film camera that I forgotten about since the dawn of the digital camera. The price of this rechargeable lithium battery is about the price of a single non rechargeable one. No brainer for this one. 
15299 perfect for my coupons 
15300 Cheaply made and put together! The pieces of it don t even fit together so the led light emits from EVERYWHERE drawing attention to it and even annoying the wearer in darker environments. Stay away! 
15301 Amazing quality, shipped on time, I love them! 
15302 Works for me! 
15303 Great camera 
15304 Sounds quality was not as good as expected. Video quality wasnt very good either 
15305 Might be overkill to use this for a &#34;tough&#34; camera but it s rigid and can hold the battery charger and extra batteries, which is all you really need when vacationing. 
15306 Thank You 
15307 Works just as described! Exactly what we needed. Thank you! 
15308 Great product 
15309 I really like the ability to attach the tripod mount below this makes it very friendly to use. 
15310 Item as described. 
15311 Great color and size. It can be used as a normal purse... Cute! 
15312 Tips over easy 
15313 Good information in a nice hand held system. Would recommend it to any photo buff with a D7100. 
15314 I don t know what its made of but it works great. 
15315 Perfect! 
15316 This lens take amazing photos. Produces a very wide, highly detailed and proportionally correct image every time. Simply outstanding!! 
15317 Excellent camera for the money. I his is my third Canon. I have a 35 mm and an eos rebel. I like the compact size and color only one lens 
15318 Color is very poor in Auto mode. I ll have to delve into the documentation to see if there is a fix. 
15319 poor colors, al photos have a green screen with this papers… bad choice 
15320 Really awesome product. 
15321 I had tough time hooking this up. I called customer service and got Marvin on the line. Badge # AR004221, he was great, he walked us through it with patience. thanks Marvin! 
15322 Fits and works great with my Fuji finepix S1 Camera. 
15323 battery is faulty, we thought it was a problem with the olympus camera,however it is not and I still need a battery that works? 
15324 Works great. Time will tell how durable it is. 
15325 Thanks! 
15326 awesome bundle 
15327 A great set. My daughter loves and and is having so much fun using it. Thank you! 
15328 Good lense. Excellent results. Glad I got it. 
15329 Good camera. Haven t really used it other than few pics 
15330 Great mounting bracket?!?! Lol. 
15331 Good 
15332 Umbrella hole is too small for my 43&#34; Westcott Umbrella. 
15333 Exactly what I wanted. Camera stores don t normally carry screw-on caps. 
15334 Good design overall! Excellent videos made 
15335 Perfect fit for my husbands drone. Very lightweight yet very sturdy. 
15336 It s basically impossible to make this camera/feed work consistently. It is unbelievably frustrating and a waste of money. 
15337 This watch is supposed to be water resistant but water got into watch after a few months of use, now it s filled with water and not usable. 
15338 I gave Digital Goja 5 stars on my Altura flash kit! I am very pleased with my purchase, the price and the follow up Customer Service. Awesome! 
15339 love it!! 
15340 Perfect 
15341 Excellent quality - love this lens 
15342 Cheap - Don t buy this! 
15343 Quick, easy setup, very useful product. I can peek at my cell phone from anywhere and see what s going on at home. I highly recommend! 
15344 Received promptly, fits my camera just fine, price was right, I m very pleased. 
15345 Audio quality is not good like camera but over all. Good 
15346 Both batteries no longer work and I have only had them almost 5 months. I had pictures scheduled and had to cancel because I charged both batteries and neither worked.. 
15347 Delivered on time and as described 
15348 Nice fit with smooth finish. Doesn t seem like it ll fall off or peel away anytime soon. The low profile makes it hard to tell that it s even there. Clear glass doesn t negatively affect image quality at all. Good product! 
15349 They ARE &#34;Wireless&#34;....But they don t run on Batteries! (WOW) - Of course they need a PLUG to have &#34;Power from Electricity&#34;! These ARE &#34;MONITORS&#34;...Not secret SPY CAMERAS!! (LOL) 
15350 Olympus batteries are the best for the Olympus cameras 
15351 Since I got my GoPro 4, I ve bought quite a few filters & junk. Out of everything this is one of my favorites! 
15352 Seems to work well. Used it to top-off my batteries and it charged-up quickly. Time will tell, but good so far. 
15353 Perfect. 
15354 Charger is fine but disappointed by the size of the batteries. Movie Cameras need bigger batteries and this was advertised for movie cameras. Better to buy the charger and batteries separately. 
15355 This is a great device that allows you to view things going on in or around your home from a remote location. It has a lot of the features of a CCTV system, but for a fraction of the cost.
